18Jb 1:1 There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of perfect integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil.
18Jb 1:2 He had seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 1:3 His estate included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.
18Jb 1:4 His sons used to have banquets, each at his house in turn. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18Jb 1:5 Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send [for his children] and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought: Perhaps my children have sinned, having cursed God in their hearts. This was Job's regular practice.
18Jb 1:6 One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
18Jb 1:7 The LORD asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" "From roaming through the earth," Satan answered Him, "and walking around on it."
18Jb 1:8 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil."
18Jb 1:9 Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18Jb 1:10 Haven't You placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are spread out in the land.
18Jb 1:11 But stretch out Your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse You to Your face."
18Jb 1:12 "Very well," the LORD told Satan, "everything he owns is in your power. However, you must not lay a hand on Job [himself]." So Satan went out from the Lord's presence.
18Jb 1:13 One day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:14 a messenger came to Job and reported: "While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby,
18Jb 1:15 the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:16 He was still speaking when another [messenger] came and reported: "A lightning storm struck from heaven. It burned up the sheep and the servants, and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:17 That messenger was still speaking when [yet] another came and reported: "The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:18 He was still speaking when another [messenger] came and reported: "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.
18Jb 1:19 Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:20 Then Job stood up, tore his robe and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,
18Jb 1:21 saying: Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will leave this life. The LORD gives, and the LORD takes away. Praise the name of the LORD.
18Jb 1:22 Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything.
18Jb 2:1 One day the sons of God came again to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before the LORD.
18Jb 2:2 The LORD asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" "From roaming through the earth," Satan answered Him, "and walking around on it."
18Jb 2:3 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? No one else on earth is like him, a man of perfect integrity, who fears God and turns away from evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him, to destroy him without just cause."
18Jb 2:4 "Skin for skin!" Satan answered the LORD. "A man will give up everything he owns in exchange for his life.
18Jb 2:5 But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face."
18Jb 2:6 "Very well," the LORD told Satan, "he is in your power; only spare his life."
18Jb 2:7 So Satan left the LORD's presence and infected Job with incurable boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.
18Jb 2:8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.
18Jb 2:9 His wife said to him, "Do you still retain your integrity? Curse God and die!"
18Jb 2:10 "You speak as a foolish woman speaks," he told her. "Should we accept only good from God and not adversity?" Throughout all this Job did not sin in what he said.
18Jb 2:11 Now when Job's three friends-- Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite-- heard about all this adversity that had happened to him, each of them came from his home. They met together to go and offer sympathy and comfort to him.
18Jb 2:12 When they looked from a distance, they could [barely] recognize him. They wept aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust into the air and on his head.
18Jb 2:13 Then they sat on the ground with him seven days and nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very intense.
18Jb 3:1 After this Job began to speak and cursed the day he was born.
18Jb 3:2 He said:
18Jb 3:3 May the day I was born perish, and the night when they said, "A boy is conceived."
18Jb 3:4 If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above not care about it, or light shine on it.
18Jb 3:5 May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it. May an eclipse of the sun terrify it.
18Jb 3:6 If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year or be listed in the calendar.
18Jb 3:7 Yes, may that night be barren; may no joyful shout be heard in it.
18Jb 3:8 Let those who curse [certain] days cast a spell on it, those who are skilled in rousing Leviathan.
18Jb 3:9 May its morning stars grow dark. May it wait for daylight but have none; may it not see the breaking of dawn.
18Jb 3:10 For that night did not shut the doors of my [mother's] womb, and hide sorrow from my eyes.
18Jb 3:11 Why was I not stillborn; [why] didn't I die as I came from the womb?
18Jb 3:12 Why did the knees receive me, and why were there breasts for me to nurse?
18Jb 3:13 For then I would have laid down in peace; I would be asleep. Then I would be at rest
18Jb 3:14 with the kings and counselors of the earth, who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves,
18Jb 3:15 or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18Jb 3:16 Or [why] was I not hidden like a miscarried child, like infants who never see daylight?
18Jb 3:17 There the wicked cease to make trouble, and there the weary find rest.
18Jb 3:18 The captives are completely at ease; they do not hear the voice of [their] oppressor.
18Jb 3:19 Both the small and the great are there, and the slave is set free from his master.
18Jb 3:20 Why is light given to one burdened with grief, and life to those whose existence is bitter,
18Jb 3:21 who wait for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasure,
18Jb 3:22 who are filled with much joy and are glad when they reach the grave?
18Jb 3:23 [Why is life given] to a man whose path is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18Jb 3:24 I sigh when food is [put] before me, and my groans pour out like water.
18Jb 3:25 For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has happened to me.
18Jb 3:26 I cannot relax or be still; I have no rest, for trouble comes.
18Jb 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18Jb 4:2 Should anyone try to speak with you when you are exhausted? Yet who can keep from speaking?
18Jb 4:3 Look! You have instructed many and have strengthened weak hands.
18Jb 4:4 Your words have steadied the one who was stumbling, and braced the knees that were buckling.
18Jb 4:5 But now that this has happened to you, you have become exhausted. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.
18Jb 4:6 Isn't your piety your confidence, and the integrity of your life your hope?
18Jb 4:7 Consider: who has perished when he was innocent? Where have the honest been destroyed?
18Jb 4:8 In my experience, those who plow injustice and those who sow trouble reap the same.
18Jb 4:9 They perish at a [single] blast from God and come to an end by the breath of His nostrils.
18Jb 4:10 The lion may roar and the fierce lion growl, but the fangs of young lions are broken.
18Jb 4:11 The strong lion dies if [it catches] no prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18Jb 4:12 A word was brought to me in secret; my ears caught a whisper of it.
18Jb 4:13 Among unsettling thoughts from visions in the night, when deep sleep descends on men,
18Jb 4:14 fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shake.
18Jb 4:15 A wind passed by me, and I shuddered with fear.
18Jb 4:16 [A figure] stood there, but I could not recognize its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes. I heard a quiet voice:
18Jb 4:17 "Can a person be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?"
18Jb 4:18 If God puts no trust in His servants and He charges His angels with foolishness,
18Jb 4:19 how much more those who dwell in clay houses, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth!
18Jb 4:20 They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; they perish forever while no one notices.
18Jb 4:21 Are their tent cords not pulled up? They die without wisdom.
18Jb 5:1 Call out if you please. Will anyone answer you? Which of the holy ones will you turn to?
18Jb 5:2 For anger kills a fool, and jealousy slays the gullible.
18Jb 5:3 I have seen a fool taking root, but I immediately pronounced a curse on his home.
18Jb 5:4 His children are far from safety. They are crushed at the [city] gate, with no one to defend [them].
18Jb 5:5 The hungry consume his harvest, even taking it out of the thorns. The thirsty pant for his children's wealth.
18Jb 5:6 For distress does not grow out of the soil, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
18Jb 5:7 But mankind is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
18Jb 5:8 However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and would present my case to Him.
18Jb 5:9 He does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.
18Jb 5:10 He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields.
18Jb 5:11 He sets the lowly on high, and mourners are lifted to safety.
18Jb 5:12 He frustrates the schemes of the crafty so that they achieve no success.
18Jb 5:13 He traps the wise in their craftiness so that the plans of the deceptive are quickly brought to an end.
18Jb 5:14 They encounter darkness by day, and they grope at noon as if it were night.
18Jb 5:15 He saves the needy from their sharp words and from the clutches of the powerful.
18Jb 5:16 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
18Jb 5:17 See how happy the man is God corrects; so do not reject the discipline of the Almighty.
18Jb 5:18 For He crushes but also binds up; He strikes, but His hands also heal.
18Jb 5:19 He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.
18Jb 5:20 In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle, from the power of the sword.
18Jb 5:21 You will be safe from slander and not fear destruction when it comes.
18Jb 5:22 You will laugh at destruction and hunger and not fear the animals of the earth.
18Jb 5:23 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18Jb 5:24 You will know that your tent is secure, and nothing will be missing when you inspect your home.
18Jb 5:25 You will also know that your offspring will be many and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
18Jb 5:26 You will approach the grave in full vigor, as a stack of sheaves is gathered in its season.
18Jb 5:27 We have investigated this, and it is true! Hear it and understand [it] for yourself.
18Jb 6:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 6:2 If only my grief could be weighed and my devastation placed with it on a scale.
18Jb 6:3 For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas! That is why my words are rash.
18Jb 6:4 Surely the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks their poison. God's terrors are arrayed against me.
18Jb 6:5 Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass or an ox low over its fodder?
18Jb 6:6 Is bland food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in an egg white?
18Jb 6:7 I refuse to touch [them]; they are like contaminated food.
18Jb 6:8 If only my request would be granted and God would provide what I hope for:
18Jb 6:9 that He would decide to crush me, to unleash His power and cut me off!
18Jb 6:10 It would still bring me comfort, and I would leap for joy in unrelenting pain that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18Jb 6:11 What strength do I have that I should continue to hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?
18Jb 6:12 Is my strength that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?
18Jb 6:13 Since I cannot help myself, [the hope for] success has been banished from me.
18Jb 6:14 A despairing man should receive loyalty from his friends, even if he abandons the fear of the Almighty.
18Jb 6:15 My brothers are as treacherous as a wadi, as seasonal streams that overflow
18Jb 6:16 and become darkened because of ice, and the snow melts into them.
18Jb 6:17 The wadis evaporate in warm weather; they disappear from their channels in hot weather.
18Jb 6:18 Caravans turn away from their routes, go up into the desert, and perish.
18Jb 6:19 The caravans of Tema look [for these streams]. The traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.
18Jb 6:20 They are ashamed because they had been confident [of finding water]. When they arrive there, they are frustrated.
18Jb 6:21 So [this] is what you have now become [to me]. When you see something dreadful, you are afraid.
18Jb 6:22 Have I ever said: Give me [something] or Pay a bribe for me from your wealth
18Jb 6:23 or Deliver me from the enemy's power or Redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless?
18Jb 6:24 Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand what I did wrong.
18Jb 6:25 How painful honest words can be! But what does your rebuke prove?
18Jb 6:26 Do you think that you can disprove [my] words or that a despairing man's words are [mere] wind?
18Jb 6:27 No doubt you would cast [lots] for a fatherless child and negotiate a price to [sell] your friend.
18Jb 6:28 But now, please look at me; would I lie to your face?
18Jb 6:29 Reconsider; don't be unjust. Reconsider; my righteousness is still the issue.
18Jb 6:30 Am I lying, or can I not recognize lies?
18Jb 7:1 Isn't mankind consigned to forced labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
18Jb 7:2 Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired man he waits for his pay.
18Jb 7:3 So I have been made to inherit months of futility, and troubled nights have been assigned to me.
18Jb 7:4 When I lie down I think: When will I get up? But the evening drags on endlessly, and I toss and turn until dawn.
18Jb 7:5 My flesh is clothed with maggots and encrusted with dirt. My skin forms scabs and then oozes.
18Jb 7:6 My days pass more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle; they come to an end without hope.
18Jb 7:7 Remember that my life is [but] a breath. My eye will never again see anything good.
18Jb 7:8 The eye of anyone who looks on me will no longer see me. Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
18Jb 7:9 As a cloud fades away and vanishes, so the one who goes down to Sheol will never rise again.
18Jb 7:10 He will never return to his house; his hometown will no longer remember him.
18Jb 7:11 Therefore I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 7:12 Am I the sea or a sea monster, that You keep me under guard?
18Jb 7:13 When I say: My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint,
18Jb 7:14 then You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions,
18Jb 7:15 so that I prefer strangling, death rather than life in this body.
18Jb 7:16 I give up! I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.
18Jb 7:17 What is man, that You think so highly of him and pay so much attention to him?
18Jb 7:18 You inspect him every morning, and put him to the test every moment.
18Jb 7:19 Will You ever look away from me, or leave me alone until I swallow my saliva?
18Jb 7:20 [If] I have sinned, what have I done to You, Watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I have become a burden to You?
18Jb 7:21 Why not forgive my sin and pardon my transgression? For soon I will lie down in the grave. You will eagerly seek me, but I will be gone.
18Jb 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18Jb 8:2 How long will you go on saying these things? Your words are a blast of wind.
18Jb 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18Jb 8:4 Since your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.
18Jb 8:5 But if you earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,
18Jb 8:6 if you are pure and upright, then He will move even now on your behalf and restore the home where your righteousness dwells.
18Jb 8:7 Then, even if your beginnings were modest, your final days will be full of prosperity.
18Jb 8:8 For ask the previous generation, and pay attention to what their fathers discovered,
18Jb 8:9 since we were [born only] yesterday and know nothing. Our days on earth are but a shadow.
18Jb 8:10 Will they not teach you and tell you and speak from their understanding?
18Jb 8:11 Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?
18Jb 8:12 While still uncut shoots, they would dry up quicker than any [other] plant.
18Jb 8:13 Such is the destiny of all who forget God; the hope of the godless will perish.
18Jb 8:14 His source of confidence is fragile; what he trusts in is a spider's web.
18Jb 8:15 He leans on his web, but it doesn't stand firm. He grabs it, but it does not hold up.
18Jb 8:16 He is an amply watered plant in the sunshine; his shoots spread out over his garden.
18Jb 8:17 His roots are intertwined around a pile of rocks. He looks for a home among the stones.
18Jb 8:18 If he is uprooted from his place, it will deny [knowing] him, saying, "I never saw you."
18Jb 8:19 Surely this is the joy of his way of life; yet others will sprout from the dust.
18Jb 8:20 Look, God does not reject a person of integrity, and He will not support evildoers.
18Jb 8:21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with a shout of joy.
18Jb 8:22 Your enemies will be clothed with shame; the tent of the wicked will exist no longer.
18Jb 9:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 9:2 Yes, I know what you've said is true, but how can a person be justified before God?
18Jb 9:3 If one wanted to take Him to court, he could not answer God once in a thousand [times].
18Jb 9:4 God is wise and all-powerful. Who has opposed Him and come out unharmed?
18Jb 9:5 He removes mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in His anger.
18Jb 9:6 He shakes the earth from its place so that its pillars tremble.
18Jb 9:7 He commands the sun not to shine and seals off the stars.
18Jb 9:8 He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
18Jb 9:9 He makes [the stars]: the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky.
18Jb 9:10 He performs great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.
18Jb 9:11 If He passes by me, I wouldn't see Him; [if] He goes right by, I wouldn't recognize Him.
18Jb 9:12 If He snatches [something], who can stop Him? Who can ask Him, "What are You doing?"
18Jb 9:13 God does not hold back His anger; Rahab's assistants cringe in fear beneath Him!
18Jb 9:14 How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?
18Jb 9:15 Even if I were in the right, I could not answer. I could only beg my judge for mercy.
18Jb 9:16 If I summoned [Him] and He answered me, I do not believe He would pay attention to what I said.
18Jb 9:17 He batters me with a whirlwind and multiplies my wounds without cause.
18Jb 9:18 He doesn't let me catch my breath but soaks me with bitter experiences.
18Jb 9:19 If it is a matter of strength, look, He is the Mighty One! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?
18Jb 9:20 Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty.
18Jb 9:21 Though I am blameless, I no longer care about myself; I renounce my life.
18Jb 9:22 It is all the same. Therefore I say, "He destroys both the blameless and the wicked."
18Jb 9:23 When disaster brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
18Jb 9:24 The earth is handed over to the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it isn't He, then who is it?
18Jb 9:25 My days fly by faster than a runner; they flee without seeing any good.
18Jb 9:26 They sweep by like boats made of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on [its] prey.
18Jb 9:27 If I said, "I will forget my complaint, change my expression, and smile,"
18Jb 9:28 I would still live in terror of all my pains. I know You will not acquit me.
18Jb 9:29 Since I will be found guilty, why should I labor in vain?
18Jb 9:30 If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,
18Jb 9:31 then You dip me in a pit [of mud], and my own clothes despise me!
18Jb 9:32 For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.
18Jb 9:33 There is no one to judge between us, to lay his hand on both of us.
18Jb 9:34 Let Him take His rod away from me so His terror will no longer frighten me.
18Jb 9:35 Then I would speak and not fear Him. But that is not the case; I am on my own.
18Jb 10:1 I am disgusted with my life. I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 10:2 I will say to God: Do not declare me guilty! Let me know why You prosecute me.
18Jb 10:3 Is it good for You to oppress, to reject the work of Your hands, and favor the plans of the wicked?
18Jb 10:4 Do You have eyes of flesh, or do You see as a human sees?
18Jb 10:5 Are Your days like those of a human, or Your years like those of a man,
18Jb 10:6 that You look for my wrongdoing and search for my sin,
18Jb 10:7 even though You know that I am not wicked and that there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?
18Jb 10:8 Your hands shaped me and formed me. Will You now turn around and destroy me?
18Jb 10:9 Please remember that You formed me like clay. Will You now return me to dust?
18Jb 10:10 Did You not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?
18Jb 10:11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and wove me together with bones and tendons.
18Jb 10:12 You gave me life and faithful love, and Your care has guarded my life.
18Jb 10:13 Yet You concealed these [thoughts] in Your heart; I know that this was Your hidden plan:
18Jb 10:14 if I sin, You would notice, and would not acquit me of my wrongdoing.
18Jb 10:15 If I am wicked, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I am filled with shame and aware of my affliction.
18Jb 10:16 If I am proud, You hunt me like a lion and again display Your miraculous power against me.
18Jb 10:17 You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me, wave after wave.
18Jb 10:18 Why did You bring me out of the womb? I should have died and never been seen.
18Jb 10:19 I wish I had never existed but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
18Jb 10:20 Are my days not few? Stop [it]! Leave me alone, so that I can smile a little
18Jb 10:21 before I go to a land of darkness and gloom, never to return.
18Jb 10:22 [It is] a land of blackness like the deepest darkness, gloomy and chaotic, where even the light is like the darkness.
18Jb 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
18Jb 11:2 Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a talker be acquitted?
18Jb 11:3 Should your babbling put others to silence, so that you can keep on ridiculing with no one to humiliate you?
18Jb 11:4 You have said, "My teaching is sound, and I am pure in Your sight."
18Jb 11:5 But if only God would speak and declare His case against you,
18Jb 11:6 He would show you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God has chosen to overlook some of your sin.
18Jb 11:7 Can you fathom the depths of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?
18Jb 11:8 [They are] higher than the heavens-- what can you do? [They are] deeper than Sheol-- what can you know?
18Jb 11:9 Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18Jb 11:10 If He passes by and throws [someone] in prison or convenes a court, who can stop Him?
18Jb 11:11 Surely He knows which people are worthless. If He sees iniquity, will He not take note [of it]?
18Jb 11:12 But a stupid man will gain understanding as soon as a wild donkey is born a man!
18Jb 11:13 As for you, if you redirect your heart and lift up your hands to Him [in prayer]--
18Jb 11:14 if there is iniquity in your hand, remove it, and don't allow injustice to dwell in your tents--
18Jb 11:15 then you will hold your head high, free from fault. You will be firmly established and unafraid.
18Jb 11:16 For you will forget your suffering, recalling [it only] as waters that have flowed by.
18Jb 11:17 [Your] life will be brighter than noonday; [its] darkness will be like the morning.
18Jb 11:18 You will be confident, because there is hope. You will look carefully about and lie down in safety.
18Jb 11:19 You will lie down without fear, and many will seek your favor.
18Jb 11:20 But the sight of the wicked will fail. Their way of escape will be cut off, and their [only] hope will be to die.
18Jb 12:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 12:2 No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!
18Jb 12:3 But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who doesn't know the things you are talking about?
18Jb 12:4 I am a laughingstock to my friends, by calling on God, who answers me. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
18Jb 12:5 The one who is at ease holds calamity in contempt [and thinks] it is prepared for those whose feet are slipping.
18Jb 12:6 The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure; God's power provides this.
18Jb 12:7 But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; [ask] the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
18Jb 12:8 Or speak to the earth, and it will instruct you; let the fish of the sea inform you.
18Jb 12:9 Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18Jb 12:10 The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.
18Jb 12:11 Doesn't the ear test words as the palate tastes food?
18Jb 12:12 Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.
18Jb 12:13 Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.
18Jb 12:14 Whatever He tears down cannot be rebuilt; whoever He imprisons cannot be released.
18Jb 12:15 When He withholds the waters, everything dries up, and when He releases them, they destroy the land.
18Jb 12:16 True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.
18Jb 12:17 He leads counselors away barefoot and makes judges go mad.
18Jb 12:18 He releases the bonds put on by kings and ties a cloth around their waists.
18Jb 12:19 He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows established leaders.
18Jb 12:20 He deprives trusted advisers of speech and takes away the elders' good judgment.
18Jb 12:21 He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the strong.
18Jb 12:22 He reveals mysteries from the darkness and brings the deepest darkness into the light.
18Jb 12:23 He makes nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges nations, then leads them away.
18Jb 12:24 He deprives the world's leaders of reason, and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
18Jb 12:25 They grope around in darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunken men.
18Jb 13:1 Look, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood it.
18Jb 13:2 Everything you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18Jb 13:3 Yet I prefer to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.
18Jb 13:4 But you coat [the truth] with lies; you are all worthless doctors.
18Jb 13:5 If only you would shut up and let that be your wisdom!
18Jb 13:6 Hear now my argument, and listen to my defense.
18Jb 13:7 Would you testify unjustly on God's behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?
18Jb 13:8 Would you show partiality to Him or argue the case in His defense?
18Jb 13:9 Would it go well if He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?
18Jb 13:10 Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
18Jb 13:11 Would God's majesty not terrify you? Would His dread not fall on you?
18Jb 13:12 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ash; your defenses are made of clay.
18Jb 13:13 Be quiet, and I will speak. Let whatever comes happen to me.
18Jb 13:14 Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?
18Jb 13:15 Even if He kills me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways before Him.
18Jb 13:16 Yes, this will result in my deliverance, for no godless person can appear before Him.
18Jb 13:17 Pay close attention to my words; let my declaration [ring] in your ears.
18Jb 13:18 Now then, I have prepared [my] case; I know that I am right.
18Jb 13:19 Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.
18Jb 13:20 Only grant [these] two things to me, [God], so that I will not have to hide from Your presence:
18Jb 13:21 remove Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.
18Jb 13:22 Then call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and You can respond to me.
18Jb 13:23 How many iniquities and sins have I committed? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
18Jb 13:24 Why do You hide Your face and consider me Your enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Will You frighten a wind-driven leaf? Will You chase after dry straw?
18Jb 13:26 For You record bitter accusations against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths, setting a limit for the soles of my feet.
18Jb 13:28 Man wears out like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.
18Jb 14:1 Man born of woman is short of days and full of trouble.
18Jb 14:2 He blossoms like a flower, then withers; he flees like a shadow and does not last.
18Jb 14:3 Do You really take notice of one like this? Will You bring me into judgment against You?
18Jb 14:4 Who can produce something pure from what is impure? No one!
18Jb 14:5 Since man's days are determined and the number of his months depends on You, and [since] You have set limits he cannot pass,
18Jb 14:6 look away from him and let him rest so that he can enjoy his day like a hired hand.
18Jb 14:7 There is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its shoots will not die.
18Jb 14:8 If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump starts to die in the soil,
18Jb 14:9 the smell of water makes it thrive and produce twigs like a sapling.
18Jb 14:10 But a man dies and fades away; he breathes his last-- where is he?
18Jb 14:11 As water disappears from the sea and a wadi becomes parched and dry,
18Jb 14:12 so man lies down never to rise again. They will not wake up until the heavens are no more; they will not stir from their sleep.
18Jb 14:13 If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger passes, that You would appoint a time for me and then remember me.
18Jb 14:14 When a man dies, will he come back to life? [If so,] I would wait all the days of my struggle until my relief comes.
18Jb 14:15 You would call, and I would answer You. You would long for the work of Your hands.
18Jb 14:16 For then You would count my steps but would not take note of my sin.
18Jb 14:17 My rebellion would be sealed up in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity.
18Jb 14:18 But as a mountain collapses and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,
18Jb 14:19 as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil from the land, so You destroy a man's hope.
18Jb 14:20 You completely overpower him, and he passes on; You change his appearance and send him away.
18Jb 14:21 If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they become insignificant, he is unaware of it.
18Jb 14:22 He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.
18Jb 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18Jb 15:2 Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill himself with the hot east wind?
18Jb 15:3 Should he argue with useless talk or with words that serve no good purpose?
18Jb 15:4 But you even undermine the fear [of God] and hinder meditation before Him.
18Jb 15:5 Your iniquity teaches you what to say, and you choose the language of the crafty.
18Jb 15:6 Your own mouth condemns you, not I; your own lips testify against you.
18Jb 15:7 Were you the first person ever born, or were you brought forth before the hills?
18Jb 15:8 Do you listen in on the council of God, or have a monopoly on wisdom?
18Jb 15:9 What do you know that we don't? [What] do you understand that is not [clear] to us?
18Jb 15:10 Both the gray-haired and the elderly are with us, men older than your father.
18Jb 15:11 Are God's consolations not enough for you, even the words that [deal] gently with you?
18Jb 15:12 Why has your heart misled you, and why do your eyes flash
18Jb 15:13 as you turn your anger against God and allow such words to leave your mouth?
18Jb 15:14 What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
18Jb 15:15 If God puts no trust in His holy ones and the heavens are not pure in His sight,
18Jb 15:16 how much less one who is revolting and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?
18Jb 15:17 Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,
18Jb 15:18 what was declared by wise men and was not suppressed by their ancestors,
18Jb 15:19 the land was given to them alone when no foreigner passed among them.
18Jb 15:20 A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; few years are stored up for the ruthless.
18Jb 15:21 Dreadful sounds fill his ears; when he is at peace, a robber attacks him.
18Jb 15:22 He doesn't believe he will return from darkness; he is destined for the sword.
18Jb 15:23 He wanders about for food, [saying,] "Where is it?" He knows the day of darkness is at hand.
18Jb 15:24 Trouble and distress terrify him, overwhelming him like a king prepared for battle.
18Jb 15:25 For he has stretched out his hand against God and has arrogantly opposed the Almighty.
18Jb 15:26 He rushes headlong at Him with his thick, studded shields.
18Jb 15:27 Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with it,
18Jb 15:28 he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become piles of rubble.
18Jb 15:29 He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not spread over the land.
18Jb 15:30 He will not escape from the darkness; flames will wither his shoots, and he will depart by the breath of God's mouth.
18Jb 15:31 Let him not put trust in worthless things, being led astray, for what he gets in exchange will prove worthless.
18Jb 15:32 It will be accomplished before his time, and his branch will not flourish.
18Jb 15:33 He will be like a vine that drops its unripe grapes and like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
18Jb 15:34 For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who offer bribes.
18Jb 15:35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb prepares deception.
18Jb 16:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 16:2 I have heard many things like these. You are all miserable comforters.
18Jb 16:3 Is there [no] end to your empty words? What provokes you that you continue testifying?
18Jb 16:4 If you were in my place I could also talk like you. I could string words together against you and shake my head at you, [but I wouldn't].
18Jb 16:5 I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation from my lips would bring relief.
18Jb 16:6 Even if I speak, my suffering is not relieved, and if I hold back, what have I lost?
18Jb 16:7 Surely He has now exhausted me. You have devastated my entire family.
18Jb 16:8 You have shriveled me up-- it has become a witness; My frailty rises up against me and testifies to my face.
18Jb 16:9 His anger tears [at me], and He harasses me. He gnashes His teeth at me. My enemy pierces me with His eyes.
18Jb 16:10 They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join themselves together against me.
18Jb 16:11 God hands me over to unjust men; He throws me into the hands of the wicked.
18Jb 16:12 I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized [me] by the scruff of the neck and smashed me to pieces. He set me up as His target;
18Jb 16:13 His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and pours my bile on the ground.
18Jb 16:14 He breaks through my defenses again and again; He charges at me like a warrior.
18Jb 16:15 I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my strength in the dust.
18Jb 16:16 My face has grown red with weeping, and the shadow of death covers my eyes,
18Jb 16:17 although my hands are free from violence and my prayer is pure.
18Jb 16:18 Earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help find no resting place.
18Jb 16:19 Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is in the heights!
18Jb 16:20 My friends scoff at me as I weep before God.
18Jb 16:21 I wish that someone might arbitrate between a man and God just as a man [pleads] for his friend.
18Jb 16:22 For [only] a few years will pass before I go the way of no return.
18Jb 17:1 My spirit is broken. My days are extinguished. A graveyard awaits me.
18Jb 17:2 Surely mockers surround me and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.
18Jb 17:3 Make arrangements! Put up security for me. Who [else] will be my sponsor?
18Jb 17:4 You have closed their minds to understanding, therefore You will not honor [them].
18Jb 17:5 If a man informs on his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.
18Jb 17:6 He has made me an object of scorn to the people; I have become a man people spit at.
18Jb 17:7 My eyes have grown dim from grief, and my whole body has become but a shadow.
18Jb 17:8 The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are roused against the godless.
18Jb 17:9 Yet the righteous person will hold to his way, and the one whose hands are clean will grow stronger.
18Jb 17:10 But come back [and try] again, all of you. I will not find a wise man among you.
18Jb 17:11 My days have slipped by; my plans have been ruined, even the things dear to my heart.
18Jb 17:12 They turned night into day and [made] light [seem] near in the face of darkness.
18Jb 17:13 If I await Sheol as my home, spread out my bed in darkness,
18Jb 17:14 and say to the Pit: You are my father, and to the worm: My mother or my sister,
18Jb 17:15 where then is my hope? Who can see [any] hope for me?
18Jb 17:16 Will it go down to the gates of Sheol, or will we descend together to the dust?
18Jb 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18Jb 18:2 How long until you stop talking? Show some sense, and then we can talk.
18Jb 18:3 Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?
18Jb 18:4 You who tear yourself in anger-- should the earth be abandoned on your account, or a rock be removed from its place?
18Jb 18:5 Yes, the light of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.
18Jb 18:6 The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him is put out.
18Jb 18:7 His powerful stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.
18Jb 18:8 For his own feet lead him into a net, and he strays into its mesh.
18Jb 18:9 A trap catches [him] by the heel; a noose seizes him.
18Jb 18:10 A rope lies hidden for him on the ground, and a snare [waits] for him along the path.
18Jb 18:11 Terrors frighten him on every side and harass him at every step.
18Jb 18:12 His strength is depleted; disaster lies ready for him to stumble.
18Jb 18:13 Parts of his skin are eaten away; death's firstborn consumes his limbs.
18Jb 18:14 He is ripped from the security of his tent and marched away to the king of terrors.
18Jb 18:15 Nothing he owned remains in his tent. Burning sulfur is scattered over his home.
18Jb 18:16 His roots below dry up, and his branches above wither away.
18Jb 18:17 [All] memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name abroad.
18Jb 18:18 He is driven from light to darkness and chased from the inhabited world.
18Jb 18:19 He has no children or descendants among his people, no survivor where he used to live.
18Jb 18:20 Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.
18Jb 18:21 Indeed, such is the dwelling of the wicked, and this is the place of the one who does not know God.
18Jb 19:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 19:2 How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
18Jb 19:3 You have humiliated me ten times now, and you mistreat me without shame.
18Jb 19:4 Even if it is true that I have sinned, my mistake concerns only me.
18Jb 19:5 If you really want to appear superior to me and would use my disgrace as evidence against me,
18Jb 19:6 then understand that it is God who has wronged me and caught me in His net.
18Jb 19:7 I cry out: Violence! but get no response; I call for help, but there is no justice.
18Jb 19:8 He has blocked my way so that I cannot pass through; He has veiled my paths with darkness.
18Jb 19:9 He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18Jb 19:10 He tears me down on every side so that I am ruined. He uproots my hope like a tree.
18Jb 19:11 His anger burns against me, and He regards me as [one of] His enemies.
18Jb 19:12 His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and camp around my tent.
18Jb 19:13 He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.
18Jb 19:14 My relatives stop coming by, and my close friends have forgotten me.
18Jb 19:15 My house guests and female servants regard me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.
18Jb 19:16 I call for my servant, but he does not answer, even if I beg him with my own mouth.
18Jb 19:17 My breath is offensive to my wife, and my own children find me repulsive.
18Jb 19:18 Even young boys scorn me. When I stand up, they mock me.
18Jb 19:19 All of my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.
18Jb 19:20 My skin and my flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
18Jb 19:21 Have mercy on me, my friends, have mercy, for God's hand has struck me.
18Jb 19:22 Why do you persecute me as God [does]? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
18Jb 19:23 I wish that my words were written down, that they were recorded on a scroll
18Jb 19:24 or were inscribed in stone forever by an iron stylus and lead!
18Jb 19:25 But I know my living Redeemer, and He will stand on the dust at last.
18Jb 19:26 Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet I will see God in my flesh.
18Jb 19:27 I will see Him myself; my eyes will look at [Him], and not as a stranger. My heart longs within me.
18Jb 19:28 If you say, "How will we pursue him, since the root of the problem lies with him?"
18Jb 19:29 be afraid of the sword, because wrath [brings] punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.
18Jb 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
18Jb 20:2 This is why my unsettling thoughts compel me to answer, because I am upset!
18Jb 20:3 I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding makes me reply.
18Jb 20:4 Don't you know that ever since antiquity, from [the time] man was placed on earth,
18Jb 20:5 the joy of the wicked has been brief and the happiness of the godless has lasted only a moment?
18Jb 20:6 Though his arrogance reaches heaven, and his head touches the clouds,
18Jb 20:7 he will vanish forever like his own dung. Those who know him will ask, "Where is he?"
18Jb 20:8 He will fly away like a dream and never be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
18Jb 20:9 The eye that saw him will see [him] no more, and his household will no longer see him.
18Jb 20:10 His children will beg from the poor, for his own hands must give back his wealth.
18Jb 20:11 His bones may be full of youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the grave.
18Jb 20:12 Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,
18Jb 20:13 though he cherishes it and will not let it go but keeps it in his mouth,
18Jb 20:14 yet the food in his stomach turns into cobras' venom inside him.
18Jb 20:15 He swallows wealth but must vomit it up; God will force it from his stomach.
18Jb 20:16 He will suck the poison of cobras; a viper's fangs will kill him.
18Jb 20:17 He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18Jb 20:18 He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming [it]; he doesn't enjoy the profits from his trading.
18Jb 20:19 For he oppressed and abandoned the poor; he seized a house he did not build.
18Jb 20:20 Because his appetite is never satisfied, he does not escape his desires.
18Jb 20:21 Nothing is left for him to consume; therefore, his prosperity will not last.
18Jb 20:22 At the height of his success distress will come to him; the full weight of misery will crush him.
18Jb 20:23 When he fills his stomach, God will send His burning anger against him, raining [it] down on him while he is eating.
18Jb 20:24 If he flees from an iron weapon, [an arrow from] a bronze bow will pierce him.
18Jb 20:25 He pulls it out of his back, the flashing tip out of his liver. Terrors come over him.
18Jb 20:26 Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned [by human hands] will consume him; it will feed on what is left in his tent.
18Jb 20:27 The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.
18Jb 20:28 The possessions in his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God's anger.
18Jb 20:29 This is the wicked man's lot from God, the inheritance God ordained for him.
18Jb 21:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 21:2 Pay close attention to my words; let this be the consolation you offer.
18Jb 21:3 Bear with me while I speak; then after I have spoken, you may continue mocking.
18Jb 21:4 As for me, is my complaint against a man? Then why shouldn't I be impatient?
18Jb 21:5 Look at me and shudder; put [your] hand over [your] mouth.
18Jb 21:6 When I think about [it], I am terrified and my body trembles in horror.
18Jb 21:7 Why do the wicked continue to live, growing old and becoming powerful?
18Jb 21:8 Their children are established while they are still alive, and their descendants, before their eyes.
18Jb 21:9 Their homes are secure and free of fear; no rod from God [strikes] them.
18Jb 21:10 Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
18Jb 21:11 They let their little ones run around like lambs; their children skip about,
18Jb 21:12 singing to the tambourine and lyre and rejoicing at the sound of the flute.
18Jb 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.
18Jb 21:14 Yet they say to God: "Leave us alone! We don't want to know Your ways.
18Jb 21:15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what will we gain by pleading with Him?"
18Jb 21:16 But their prosperity is not of their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
18Jb 21:17 How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come on them? Does He apportion destruction in His anger?
18Jb 21:18 Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff a storm sweeps away?
18Jb 21:19 God reserves a person's punishment for his children. Let God repay the person himself, so that he may know [it].
18Jb 21:20 Let his own eyes see his demise; let him drink from the Almighty's wrath!
18Jb 21:21 For what does he care about his family once he is dead, when the number of his months has run out?
18Jb 21:22 Can anyone teach God knowledge, since He judges the exalted ones?
18Jb 21:23 One person dies in excellent health, completely secure and at ease.
18Jb 21:24 His body is well-fed, and his bones are full of marrow.
18Jb 21:25 Yet another person dies with a bitter soul, having never tasted prosperity.
18Jb 21:26 But they both lie in the dust, and worms cover them.
18Jb 21:27 Look, I know your thoughts, the schemes you would wrong me with.
18Jb 21:28 For you say, "Where now is the nobleman's house?" and "Where are the tents the wicked lived in?"
18Jb 21:29 Have you never consulted those who travel the roads? Don't you accept their reports?
18Jb 21:30 Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of disaster, rescued from the day of wrath.
18Jb 21:31 Who would denounce his behavior to his face? Who would repay him for what he has done?
18Jb 21:32 He is carried to the grave, and someone keeps watch over [his] tomb.
18Jb 21:33 The dirt on his grave is sweet to him. Everyone follows behind him, and those who go before him are without number.
18Jb 21:34 So how can you offer me such futile comfort? Your answers are deceptive.
18Jb 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18Jb 22:2 Can a man be of [any] use to God? Can even a wise man be of use to Him?
18Jb 22:3 Does it delight the Almighty if you are righteous? Does He profit if you perfect your behavior?
18Jb 22:4 Does He correct you and take you to court because of your piety?
18Jb 22:5 Isn't your wickedness abundant and aren't your iniquities endless?
18Jb 22:6 For you took collateral from your brothers without cause, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.
18Jb 22:7 You gave no water to the thirsty and withheld food from the famished,
18Jb 22:8 while the land belonged to a powerful man and an influential man lived on it.
18Jb 22:9 You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
18Jb 22:10 Therefore snares surround you, and sudden dread terrifies you,
18Jb 22:11 or darkness, so you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.
18Jb 22:12 Isn't God as high as the heavens? And look at the highest stars-- how lofty they are!
18Jb 22:13 Yet you say: "What does God know? Can He judge through thick darkness?
18Jb 22:14 Clouds veil Him so that He cannot see, as He walks on the circle of the sky."
18Jb 22:15 Will you continue on the ancient path that wicked men have walked?
18Jb 22:16 They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were washed away by a river.
18Jb 22:17 They were the ones who said to God, "Leave us alone!" and "What can the Almighty do to us?"
18Jb 22:18 But it was He who filled their houses with good things. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
18Jb 22:19 The righteous see [this] and rejoice; the innocent mock them, [saying],
18Jb 22:20 "Surely our opponents are destroyed, and fire has consumed what they left behind."
18Jb 22:21 Come to terms with God and be at peace; in this way good will come to you.
18Jb 22:22 Receive instruction from His mouth, and place His sayings in your heart.
18Jb 22:23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be renewed. If you banish injustice from your tent
18Jb 22:24 and consign your gold to the dust, [the gold of] Ophir to the stones in the wadis,
18Jb 22:25 the Almighty will be your gold and your finest silver.
18Jb 22:26 Then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
18Jb 22:27 You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
18Jb 22:28 When you make a decision, it will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.
18Jb 22:29 When others are humiliated and you say, "Lift [them] up," God will save the humble.
18Jb 22:30 He will [even] rescue the guilty one, who will be rescued by the purity of your hands.
18Jb 23:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 23:2 Today also my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
18Jb 23:3 If only I knew how to find Him, so that I could go to His throne.
18Jb 23:4 I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18Jb 23:5 I would learn how He would answer me; and understand what He would say to me.
18Jb 23:6 Would He prosecute me forcefully? No, He will certainly pay attention to me.
18Jb 23:7 There an upright man could reason with Him, and I would escape from my Judge forever.
18Jb 23:8 If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot perceive Him.
18Jb 23:9 When He is at work to the north, I cannot see Him; when He turns south, I cannot find Him.
18Jb 23:10 Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will emerge as pure gold.
18Jb 23:11 My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept to His way and not turned aside.
18Jb 23:12 I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily food.
18Jb 23:13 But He is unchangeable; who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.
18Jb 23:14 He will certainly accomplish what He has decreed for me, and He has many more things like these in mind.
18Jb 23:15 Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider [this], I am afraid of Him.
18Jb 23:16 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
18Jb 23:17 Yet I am not destroyed by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
18Jb 24:1 Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why do those who know Him never see His days?
18Jb 24:2 The wicked displace boundary markers. They steal a flock and provide pasture for [it].
18Jb 24:3 They drive away the donkeys [owned] by the fatherless and take the widow's ox as collateral.
18Jb 24:4 They push the needy off the road; the poor of the land are forced into hiding.
18Jb 24:5 Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go out to their task of foraging for food; the wilderness provides nourishment for their children.
18Jb 24:6 They gather their fodder in the field and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
18Jb 24:7 Without clothing, they spend the night naked, having no covering against the cold.
18Jb 24:8 Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks, shelterless.
18Jb 24:9 The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized as collateral.
18Jb 24:10 Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry sheaves but go hungry.
18Jb 24:11 They crush olives in their presses; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
18Jb 24:12 From the city, men groan; the mortally wounded cry for help, yet God pays no attention to this crime.
18Jb 24:13 The wicked are those who rebel against the light. They do not recognize its ways or stay on its paths.
18Jb 24:14 The murderer rises at dawn to kill the poor and needy, and by night he becomes a thief.
18Jb 24:15 The adulterer's eye watches for twilight, thinking: No eye will see me, he covers [his] face.
18Jb 24:16 In the dark they break into houses; by day they lock themselves in, never experiencing the light.
18Jb 24:17 For the morning is like death's shadow to them. Surely they are familiar with the terrors of death's shadow!
18Jb 24:18 They float on the surface of the water. Their section of the land is cursed, so that they never go to [their] vineyards.
18Jb 24:19 As dry ground and heat snatch away the melted snow, so Sheol [steals] those who have sinned.
18Jb 24:20 The womb forgets them; worms feed on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is broken like a tree.
18Jb 24:21 They prey on the barren, childless woman and do not deal kindly with the widow.
18Jb 24:22 Yet God drags away the mighty by His power; when He rises up, they have no assurance of life.
18Jb 24:23 He gives them a sense of security, so they can rely [on it], but His eyes [watch] over their ways.
18Jb 24:24 They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and shrivel up like everything else. They wither like heads of grain.
18Jb 24:25 If this is not true, then who can prove me a liar and show that my speech is worthless?
18Jb 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18Jb 25:2 Dominion and dread belong to Him, the One who establishes harmony in the heavens.
18Jb 25:3 Can His troops be numbered? Does His light not shine on everyone?
18Jb 25:4 How can a person be justified before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
18Jb 25:5 If even the moon does not shine and the stars are not pure in His sight,
18Jb 25:6 how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!
18Jb 26:1 Then Job answered:
18Jb 26:2 How you have helped the powerless and delivered the arm that is weak!
18Jb 26:3 How you have counseled the unwise and thoroughly explained [the path to] success!
18Jb 26:4 Who did you speak these words to? Whose breath came out of your [mouth]?
18Jb 26:5 The departed spirits tremble beneath the waters and [all] that inhabit them.
18Jb 26:6 Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
18Jb 26:7 He stretches the northern [skies] over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.
18Jb 26:8 He enfolds the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst beneath their weight.
18Jb 26:9 He obscures the view of [His] throne, spreading His cloud over it.
18Jb 26:10 He laid out the horizon on the surface of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
18Jb 26:11 The pillars [that hold up] the sky tremble, astounded at His rebuke.
18Jb 26:12 By His power He stirred the sea, and by His understanding He crushed Rahab.
18Jb 26:13 By His breath the heavens gained their beauty; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
18Jb 26:14 These are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the word we hear of Him! Who can understand His mighty thunder?
18Jb 27:1 Job continued his discourse, saying:
18Jb 27:2 As God lives, who has deprived me of justice, and the Almighty who has made me bitter,
18Jb 27:3 as long as my breath is still in me and the breath from God remains in my nostrils,
18Jb 27:4 my lips will not speak unjustly, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
18Jb 27:5 I will never affirm that you are right. I will maintain my integrity until I die.
18Jb 27:6 I will cling to my righteousness and never let it go. My conscience will not accuse [me] as long as I live!
18Jb 27:7 May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.
18Jb 27:8 For what hope does the godless man have when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
18Jb 27:9 Will God hear his cry when distress comes on him?
18Jb 27:10 Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?
18Jb 27:11 I will teach you about God's power. I will not conceal what the Almighty has planned.
18Jb 27:12 All of you have seen [this] for yourselves, why do you keep up this empty talk?
18Jb 27:13 This is a wicked man's lot from God, the inheritance the ruthless receive from the Almighty.
18Jb 27:14 Even if his children increase, they are destined for the sword; his descendants will never have enough food.
18Jb 27:15 Those who survive him will be buried by the plague, yet their widows will not weep [for them].
18Jb 27:16 Though he piles up silver like dust and heaps up a wardrobe like clay--
18Jb 27:17 he may heap [it] up, but the righteous will wear [it], and the innocent will divide up his silver.
18Jb 27:18 The house he built is like a moth's [cocoon] or a booth set up by a watchman.
18Jb 27:19 He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, it is gone.
18Jb 27:20 Terrors overtake him like a flood; a storm wind sweeps him away at night.
18Jb 27:21 An east wind picks him up, and he is gone; it carries him away from his place.
18Jb 27:22 It blasts at him without mercy, while he flees desperately from its grasp.
18Jb 27:23 It claps its hands at him and scorns him from its place.
18Jb 28:1 Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
18Jb 28:2 Iron is taken from the ground, and copper is smelted from ore.
18Jb 28:3 A miner puts an end to the darkness; he probes the deepest recesses for ore in the gloomy darkness.
18Jb 28:4 He cuts a shaft far from human habitation, [in places] unknown to those who walk above ground. Suspended far away from people, the miners swing back and forth.
18Jb 28:5 Food may come from the earth, but below the surface the earth is transformed as by fire.
18Jb 28:6 Its rocks are a source of sapphire, containing flecks of gold.
18Jb 28:7 No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon's eye has seen it.
18Jb 28:8 Proud beasts have never walked on it; no lion has ever prowled over it.
18Jb 28:9 The miner strikes the flint and transforms the mountains at [their] foundations.
18Jb 28:10 He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.
18Jb 28:11 He dams up the streams from flowing so that he may bring to light what is hidden.
18Jb 28:12 But where can wisdom be found, and where is understanding located?
18Jb 28:13 No man can know its value, since it cannot be found in the land of the living.
18Jb 28:14 The ocean depths say, "It's not in me," while the sea declares, "I don't have it."
18Jb 28:15 Gold cannot be exchanged for it, and silver cannot be weighed out for its price.
18Jb 28:16 Wisdom cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
18Jb 28:17 Gold and glass do not compare with it, and articles of fine gold cannot be exchanged for it.
18Jb 28:18 Coral and quartz are not worth mentioning. The price of wisdom is beyond pearls.
18Jb 28:19 Topaz from Cush cannot compare with it, and it cannot be valued in pure gold.
18Jb 28:20 Where then does wisdom come from, and where is understanding located?
18Jb 28:21 It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the sky.
18Jb 28:22 Abaddon and Death say, "We have heard news of it with our ears."
18Jb 28:23 But God understands the way to wisdom, and He knows its location.
18Jb 28:24 For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18Jb 28:25 When God fixed the weight of the wind and limited the water by measure,
18Jb 28:26 when He established a limit for the rain and a path for the lightning,
18Jb 28:27 He considered wisdom and evaluated it; He established it and examined it.
18Jb 28:28 He said to mankind, "Look! The fear of the Lord-- that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding."
18Jb 29:1 Job continued his discourse, saying:
18Jb 29:2 If only I could be as in months gone by, in the days when God watched over me,
18Jb 29:3 when His lamp shone above my head, and I walked through darkness by His light!
18Jb 29:4 [I would be] as I was in the days of my youth when God's friendship rested on my tent,
18Jb 29:5 when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
18Jb 29:6 when my feet were bathed in cream and the rock poured out streams of oil for me!
18Jb 29:7 When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the town square,
18Jb 29:8 the young men saw me and withdrew, while older men stood to their feet.
18Jb 29:9 City officials stopped talking and covered their mouths with [their] hands.
18Jb 29:10 The noblemen's voices were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
18Jb 29:11 When they heard me, they blessed me, and when they saw me, they spoke well of me.
18Jb 29:12 For I rescued the poor man who cried out for help, and the fatherless child who had no one to support him.
18Jb 29:13 The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow's heart rejoice.
18Jb 29:14 I clothed myself in righteousness, and it enveloped me; my just decisions were like a robe and a turban.
18Jb 29:15 I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
18Jb 29:16 I was a father to the needy, and I examined the case of the stranger.
18Jb 29:17 I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.
18Jb 29:18 So I thought: I will die in my own nest and multiply [my] days as the sand.
18Jb 29:19 My roots will have access to water, and the dew will rest on my branches all night.
18Jb 29:20 My strength will be refreshed within me, and my bow will be renewed in my hand.
18Jb 29:21 Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my advice.
18Jb 29:22 After a word from me they did not speak again; my speech settled on them [like dew].
18Jb 29:23 They waited for me as for the rain and opened their mouths as for spring showers.
18Jb 29:24 If I smiled at them, they couldn't believe [it]; they were thrilled at the light of my countenance.
18Jb 29:25 I directed their course and presided as chief. I lived as a king among his troops, like one who comforts those who mourn.
18Jb 30:1 But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs.
18Jb 30:2 What use to me was the strength of their hands? Their vigor had left them.
18Jb 30:3 Emaciated from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, the desolate wasteland by night.
18Jb 30:4 They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.
18Jb 30:5 They were expelled from human society; people shouted at them as [if they were] thieves.
18Jb 30:6 They are living on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
18Jb 30:7 They bray among the shrubs; they huddle beneath the thistles.
18Jb 30:8 Foolish men, without even a name! They were forced to leave the land.
18Jb 30:9 Now I am mocked by their songs; I have become an object of scorn to them.
18Jb 30:10 They despise me and keep their distance from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
18Jb 30:11 Because God has loosened my bowstring and oppressed me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
18Jb 30:12 The rabble rise up at my right; they trap my feet and construct their siege ramp against me.
18Jb 30:13 They tear up my path; they contribute to my destruction, without anyone to help them.
18Jb 30:14 They advance as through a gaping breach; they keep rolling in through the ruins.
18Jb 30:15 Terrors are turned loose against me; they chase my dignity away like the wind, and my prosperity has passed by like a cloud.
18Jb 30:16 Now my life is poured out before my [eyes], and days of suffering have seized me.
18Jb 30:17 Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never abate.
18Jb 30:18 My clothing is distorted with great force; He chokes me by the neck of my garment.
18Jb 30:19 He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.
18Jb 30:20 I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer me; when I stand up, You [merely] look at me.
18Jb 30:21 You have turned against me with cruelty; You harass me with Your strong hand.
18Jb 30:22 You lift me up on the wind and make me ride [it]; You scatter me in the storm.
18Jb 30:23 Yes, I know that You will lead me to death-- the place appointed for all who live.
18Jb 30:24 Yet no one would stretch out [his] hand against a ruined man when he cries out to him for help because of his distress.
18Jb 30:25 Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
18Jb 30:26 But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness came.
18Jb 30:27 I am churning within and cannot rest; days of suffering confront me.
18Jb 30:28 I walk about blackened, but not by the sun. I stood in the assembly and cried out for help.
18Jb 30:29 I have become a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches.
18Jb 30:30 My skin blackens and flakes off, and my bones burn with fever.
18Jb 30:31 My lyre is [used] for mourning and my flute for the sound of weeping.
18Jb 31:1 I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I look at a young woman?
18Jb 31:2 For what portion [would I have] from God above, or [what] inheritance from the Almighty on high?
18Jb 31:3 Doesn't disaster come to the wicked and misfortune to evildoers?
18Jb 31:4 Does He not see my ways and number all my steps?
18Jb 31:5 If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,
18Jb 31:6 let God weigh me with an accurate balance, and He will recognize my integrity.
18Jb 31:7 If my step has turned from the way, my heart has followed my eyes, or impurity has stained my hands,
18Jb 31:8 let someone else eat what I have sown, and let my crops be uprooted.
18Jb 31:9 If my heart has been seduced by [my neighbor's] wife or I have lurked at his door,
18Jb 31:10 let my own wife grind [grain] for another man, and let other men sleep with her.
18Jb 31:11 For that would be a disgrace; it would be a crime deserving punishment.
18Jb 31:12 For it is a fire that consumes down to Abaddon; it would destroy my entire harvest.
18Jb 31:13 If I have dismissed the case of my male or female servants when they made a complaint against me,
18Jb 31:14 what could I do when God stands up [to judge]? How should I answer Him when He calls [me] to account?
18Jb 31:15 Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same God form us both in the womb?
18Jb 31:16 If I have refused the wishes of the poor or let the widow's eyes go blind,
18Jb 31:17 if I have eaten my few crumbs alone without letting the fatherless eat any of it--
18Jb 31:18 for from my youth, I raised him as [his] father, and since the day I was born I guided the widow--
18Jb 31:19 if I have seen anyone dying for lack of clothing or a needy person without a cloak,
18Jb 31:20 if he did not bless me while warming himself with the fleece from my sheep,
18Jb 31:21 if I ever cast my vote against a fatherless child when I saw that I had support in the [city] gate,
18Jb 31:22 then let my shoulder blade fall from my back, and my arm be pulled from its socket.
18Jb 31:23 For disaster from God terrifies me, and because of His majesty I could not do [these things].
18Jb 31:24 If I placed my confidence in gold or called fine gold my trust,
18Jb 31:25 if I have rejoiced because my wealth is great or because my own hand has acquired [so] much,
18Jb 31:26 if I have gazed at the sun when it was shining or at the moon moving in splendor,
18Jb 31:27 so that my heart was secretly enticed and I threw them a kiss,
18Jb 31:28 this would also be a crime deserving punishment, for I would have denied God above.
18Jb 31:29 Have I rejoiced over my enemy's distress, or become excited when trouble came his way?
18Jb 31:30 I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse.
18Jb 31:31 Haven't the members of my household said, "Who is there who has not had enough to eat at Job's table?"
18Jb 31:32 No stranger had to spend the night on the street, for I opened my door to the traveler.
18Jb 31:33 Have I covered my transgressions as others do by hiding my guilt in my heart,
18Jb 31:34 because I greatly feared the crowds, and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so I grew silent and would not go outside?
18Jb 31:35 If only I had someone to hear my [case]! Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me. Let my Opponent compose [His] indictment.
18Jb 31:36 I would surely carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.
18Jb 31:37 I would give Him an account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.
18Jb 31:38 If my land cries out against me and its furrows join in weeping,
18Jb 31:39 if I have consumed its produce without payment or shown contempt for its tenants,
18Jb 31:40 then let thorns grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley. The words of Job are concluded.
18Jb 32:1 So these three men quit answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18Jb 32:2 Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite from the family of Ram became angry. He was angry at Job because he had justified himself rather than God.
18Jb 32:3 He was also angry at Job's three friends because they had failed to refute [him], and yet had condemned him.
18Jb 32:4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were [all] older than he.
18Jb 32:5 But when he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he became angry.
18Jb 32:6 So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite replied: I am young in years, while you are old; therefore I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.
18Jb 32:7 I thought that age should speak and maturity should teach wisdom.
18Jb 32:8 But it is a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty that give him understanding.
18Jb 32:9 It is not [only] the old who are wise or the elderly who understand how to judge.
18Jb 32:10 Therefore I say, "Listen to me. I too will declare what I know."
18Jb 32:11 Look, I waited for your conclusions; I listened to your insights as you sought for words.
18Jb 32:12 I paid close attention to you. Yet no one proved Job wrong; not one of you refuted his arguments.
18Jb 32:13 So do not claim, "We have found wisdom; let God deal with him, not man."
18Jb 32:14 But Job has not directed his argument to me, and I will not respond to him with your arguments.
18Jb 32:15 Job's friends are dismayed and can no longer answer; words have left them.
18Jb 32:16 Should I continue to wait now that they are silent, now that they stand [there] and no longer answer?
18Jb 32:17 I too will answer; yes, I will tell what I know.
18Jb 32:18 For I am full of words, and my spirit compels me [to speak].
18Jb 32:19 My heart is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like new wineskins.
18Jb 32:20 I must speak so that I can find relief; I must open my lips and respond.
18Jb 32:21 I will be partial to no one, and I will not give anyone an [undeserved] title.
18Jb 32:22 For I do not know how to give [such] titles; otherwise, my Maker would remove me in an instant.
18Jb 33:1 But now, Job, pay attention to my speech, and listen to all my words.
18Jb 33:2 I am going to open my mouth; my tongue will form words on my palate.
18Jb 33:3 My words [come from] my upright heart, and my lips speak what they know with sincerity.
18Jb 33:4 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18Jb 33:5 Refute me if you can. Prepare your case against me; take your stand.
18Jb 33:6 I am just like you before God; I was also pinched off from [a piece of] clay.
18Jb 33:7 Fear of me should not terrify you; the pressure I exert against you will be light.
18Jb 33:8 Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:
18Jb 33:9 "I am pure, without transgression; I am clean and have no guilt.
18Jb 33:10 But He finds reasons to oppose me; He regards me as his enemy.
18Jb 33:11 He puts my feet in the stocks; He stands watch over all my paths."
18Jb 33:12 But I tell you that you are wrong in this [matter], since God is greater than man.
18Jb 33:13 Why do you take Him to court for not answering anything a person asks?
18Jb 33:14 For God speaks time and again, but a person may not notice it.
18Jb 33:15 In a dream, a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber on [their] beds,
18Jb 33:16 He uncovers their ears at that time and terrifies them with warnings,
18Jb 33:17 in order to turn a person [from his] actions and suppress his pride.
18Jb 33:18 God spares his soul from the Pit, his life from crossing the river [of death].
18Jb 33:19 A person may be disciplined on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,
18Jb 33:20 so that he detests bread, and his soul [despises his] favorite food.
18Jb 33:21 His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his unseen bones stick out.
18Jb 33:22 He draws near the Pit, and his life to the executioners.
18Jb 33:23 If there is an angel on his side, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a person what is right for him
18Jb 33:24 and to be gracious to him and say, "Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom,"
18Jb 33:25 then his flesh will be healthier than in his youth, and he will return to the days of his youthful vigor.
18Jb 33:26 He will pray to God, and God will delight in him. That man will behold His face with a shout of joy, and God will restore his righteousness to him.
18Jb 33:27 He will look at men and say, "I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.
18Jb 33:28 He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will continue to see the light."
18Jb 33:29 God certainly does all these things two or three times to a man
18Jb 33:30 in order to turn him back from the Pit, so he may shine with the light of life.
18Jb 33:31 Pay attention, Job, and listen to me. Be quiet, and I will speak.
18Jb 33:32 But if you have something to say, answer me; speak, for I would like to justify you.
18Jb 33:33 If not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.
18Jb 34:1 Then Elihu continued, saying:
18Jb 34:2 Hear my words, you wise men, and listen to me, you knowledgeable ones.
18Jb 34:3 Doesn't the ear tests words as the palate tastes food?
18Jb 34:4 Let us judge for ourselves what is right; let us decide together what is good.
18Jb 34:5 For Job has declared, "I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.
18Jb 34:6 Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression."
18Jb 34:7 What man is like Job? He drinks derision like water.
18Jb 34:8 He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.
18Jb 34:9 For he has said, "A man gains nothing when he becomes God's friend."
18Jb 34:10 Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding. It is impossible for God [to do] wrong, and [for] the Almighty [to act] unjustly.
18Jb 34:11 For He repays a person [according to] his deeds, and He bring his ways on him.
18Jb 34:12 Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
18Jb 34:13 Who gave Him authority over the earth? Who put Him in charge of the entire world?
18Jb 34:14 If He put His mind to it and withdrew the spirit and breath He [gave],
18Jb 34:15 every living thing would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
18Jb 34:16 If you [have] understanding, hear this; listen to what I have to say.
18Jb 34:17 Could one who hates justice govern [the world]? Will you condemn the mighty Righteous One,
18Jb 34:18 who says to a king, "Worthless man!" and to nobles, "Wicked men!"?
18Jb 34:19 God is not partial to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of His hands.
18Jb 34:20 They die suddenly in the middle of the night; people shudder, then pass away. Even the mighty are removed without effort.
18Jb 34:21 For His eyes [watch] over a man's ways, and He observes all his steps.
18Jb 34:22 There is no darkness, no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves.
18Jb 34:23 God does not [need to] examine a person further, that one should approach Him in court.
18Jb 34:24 He shatters the mighty without an investigation and sets others in their place.
18Jb 34:25 Therefore, He recognizes their deeds and overthrows [them] by night, and they are crushed.
18Jb 34:26 In full view of the public, He strikes them for their wickedness,
18Jb 34:27 because they turned aside from following Him and did not understand any of His ways
18Jb 34:28 but caused the poor to cry out to Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
18Jb 34:29 But when God is silent, who can declare [Him] guilty? When He hides [His] face, who can see Him? Yet He [watches] over both individuals and nations,
18Jb 34:30 so that godless men should not rule or ensnare the people.
18Jb 34:31 Suppose someone says to God, "I have endured [my punishment]; I will no [longer] act wickedly.
18Jb 34:32 Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I won't do it again."
18Jb 34:33 Should God repay [you] on your terms when you have rejected [His]? You must choose, not I! So declare what you know.
18Jb 34:34 Reasonable men will say to me, along with the wise men who hear me,
18Jb 34:35 "Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight."
18Jb 34:36 If only Job were tested to the limit, because [his] answers are [like] those of wicked men.
18Jb 34:37 For he adds rebellion to his sin; he [scornfully] claps in our presence, while multiplying his words against God.
18Jb 35:1 Then Elihu continued, saying:
18Jb 35:2 Do you think it is just when you say, "I am righteous before God"?
18Jb 35:3 For you ask, "What does it profit You, and what benefit comes to me, if I do not sin?"
18Jb 35:4 I will answer you and your friends with you.
18Jb 35:5 Look at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.
18Jb 35:6 If you sin, how does it affect God? If you multiply your transgressions, what does it do to Him?
18Jb 35:7 If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?
18Jb 35:8 Your wickedness [affects] a person like yourself, and your righteousness [another] human being.
18Jb 35:9 People cry out because of severe oppression; they shout for help from the arm of the mighty.
18Jb 35:10 But no one asks, "Where is God my Maker, who provides [us] with songs in the night,
18Jb 35:11 who gives us more understanding than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?"
18Jb 35:12 There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
18Jb 35:13 Indeed, God does not listen to empty [cries], and the Almighty does not take note of it--
18Jb 35:14 how much less when you complain that you do not see Him, [that your] case is before Him and you are waiting for Him.
18Jb 35:15 But now, because God's anger does not punish and He does not pay attention to transgression,
18Jb 35:16 Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.
18Jb 36:1 Then Elihu continued, saying:
18Jb 36:2 Be patient with me a little longer, and I will inform you, for there is still more to be said on God's behalf.
18Jb 36:3 I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
18Jb 36:4 For my arguments are without flaw; one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
18Jb 36:5 Yes, God is mighty, but He despises [no one]; He understands all things.
18Jb 36:6 He does not keep the wicked alive, but He gives justice to the afflicted.
18Jb 36:7 He does not remove His gaze from the righteous, but He seats them forever with enthroned kings, and they are exalted.
18Jb 36:8 If people are bound with chains and trapped by the cords of affliction,
18Jb 36:9 God tells them what they have done and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
18Jb 36:10 He opens their ears to correction and insists they repent from iniquity.
18Jb 36:11 If they serve Him obediently, they will end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.
18Jb 36:12 But if they do not obey, they will cross the river [of death] and die without knowledge.
18Jb 36:13 Those who have a godless heart harbor anger; even when God binds them, they do not cry for help.
18Jb 36:14 They die in their youth; their life [ends] among male cult prostitutes.
18Jb 36:15 God rescues the afflicted by afflicting them; He instructs them by means of their torment.
18Jb 36:16 Indeed, He lured you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and unconfined place. Your table was spread with choice food.
18Jb 36:17 Yet [now] you are obsessed with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.
18Jb 36:18 Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large ransom lead you astray.
18Jb 36:19 Can your wealth or all [your] physical exertion keep [you] from distress?
18Jb 36:20 Do not long for the night when nations will disappear from their places.
18Jb 36:21 Be careful that you do not turn to iniquity, for that is why you have been tested by affliction.
18Jb 36:22 Look, God shows Himself exalted by His power. Who is a teacher like Him?
18Jb 36:23 Who has appointed His way for Him, and who has declared, "You have done wrong"?
18Jb 36:24 Remember that you should praise His work, which people have sung about.
18Jb 36:25 All mankind has seen it; people have looked at it from a distance.
18Jb 36:26 Look, God is exalted beyond our knowledge; the number of His years cannot be counted.
18Jb 36:27 For He makes waterdrops evaporate; they distill the rain into its mist,
18Jb 36:28 which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.
18Jb 36:29 Can anyone understand how the clouds spread out or how the thunder roars from God's pavilion?
18Jb 36:30 Look, He spreads His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.
18Jb 36:31 For He judges the nations with these; He gives food in abundance.
18Jb 36:32 He covers [His] hands with lightning and commands it to hit its mark.
18Jb 36:33 The thunder declares His presence; the cattle also, the approaching [storm].
18Jb 37:1 My heart pounds at this and leaps from my chest.
18Jb 37:2 Just listen to His thunderous voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.
18Jb 37:3 He lets it loose beneath the entire sky; His lightning to the ends of the earth.
18Jb 37:4 Then there comes a roaring sound; God thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His [rumbling] voice is heard.
18Jb 37:5 God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things that we cannot comprehend.
18Jb 37:6 For He says to the snow, "Fall to the earth," and the torrential rains, His mighty torrential rains,
18Jb 37:7 serve as His signature to all mankind, so that all men may know His work.
18Jb 37:8 The wild animals enter [their] lairs and stay in their dens.
18Jb 37:9 The windstorm comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.
18Jb 37:10 Ice is formed by the breath of God, and watery expanses are frozen.
18Jb 37:11 He saturates clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.
18Jb 37:12 They swirl about, turning round and round at His direction, accomplishing everything He commands them over the surface of the inhabited world.
18Jb 37:13 He causes this to happen for punishment, for His land, or for His faithful love.
18Jb 37:14 Listen to this, Job. Stop and consider God's wonders.
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God directs His clouds or makes their lightning flash?
18Jb 37:16 Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonderful works of Him who has perfect knowledge?
18Jb 37:17 You whose clothes get hot when the south wind brings calm to the land,
18Jb 37:18 can you help God spread out the skies as hard as a cast metal mirror?
18Jb 37:19 Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot prepare [our case] because of our darkness.
18Jb 37:20 Should He be told that I want to speak? Can a man speak when he is confused?
18Jb 37:21 Now men cannot [even] look at the sun when it is in the skies, after a wind has swept through and cleared them away.
18Jb 37:22 Yet out of the north He comes, [shrouded] in a golden [glow]; awesome majesty surrounds Him.
18Jb 37:23 The Almighty-- we cannot reach Him-- He is exalted in power! In His justice and righteousness, He will not oppress.
18Jb 37:24 Therefore, men fear Him. He does not look favorably on any who are wise in heart.
18Jb 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind. He said:
18Jb 38:2 Who is this who obscures [My] counsel with ignorant words?
18Jb 38:3 Get ready to answer Me like a man; when I question you, you will inform Me.
18Jb 38:4 Where were you when I established the earth? Tell [Me], if you have understanding.
18Jb 38:5 Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
18Jb 38:6 What supports its foundations? Or who laid its cornerstone
18Jb 38:7 while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
18Jb 38:8 Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst from the womb,
18Jb 38:9 when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,
18Jb 38:10 when I determined its boundaries and put [its] bars and doors in place,
18Jb 38:11 when I declared: "You may come this far, but no farther; your proud waves stop here"?
18Jb 38:12 Have you ever in your life commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,
18Jb 38:13 so it may seize the edges of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?
18Jb 38:14 The earth is changed as clay is by a seal; [its hills] stand out like [the folds of] a garment.
18Jb 38:15 Light is withheld from the wicked, and the arm raised [in violence] is broken.
18Jb 38:16 Have you traveled to the sources of the sea or walked in the depths of the oceans?
18Jb 38:17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of death's shadow?
18Jb 38:18 Have you comprehended the extent of the earth? Tell [Me], if you know all this.
18Jb 38:19 Where is the road to the home of light? [Do you know] where darkness lives,
18Jb 38:20 so you can lead it back to its border? Are you familiar with the paths to its home?
18Jb 38:21 Don't you know? You were already born; you have lived so long!
18Jb 38:22 Have you entered the [place] where the snow is stored? Or have you seen the storehouses of hail,
18Jb 38:23 which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of warfare and battle?
18Jb 38:24 What road leads to [the place] where light is dispersed? [Where is the source of] the east wind that spreads across the earth?
18Jb 38:25 Who cuts a channel for the flooding rain or clears the way for lightning,
18Jb 38:26 to bring rain on an uninhabited land, [on] a desert with no human life,
18Jb 38:27 to satisfy the parched wasteland and cause the grass to sprout?
18Jb 38:28 Does the rain have a father? Who fathered the drops of dew?
18Jb 38:29 Whose womb did the ice come from? Who gave birth to the frost of heaven
18Jb 38:30 when water becomes as hard as stone, and the surface of the watery depths is frozen?
18Jb 38:31 Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?
18Jb 38:32 Can you bring out the constellations in their season and lead the Bear and her cubs?
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the laws of heaven? Can you impose its authority on earth?
18Jb 38:34 Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?
18Jb 38:35 Can you send out lightning bolts, and they go? Do they report to you: "Here we are"?
18Jb 38:36 Who put wisdom in the heart or gave the mind understanding?
18Jb 38:37 Who has the wisdom to number the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of heaven
18Jb 38:38 when the dust hardens like cast metal and the clods [of dirt] stick together?
18Jb 38:39 Can you hunt prey for a lioness or satisfy the appetite of young lions
18Jb 38:40 when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait within their lairs?
18Jb 38:41 Who provides the raven's food when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
18Jb 39:1 Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the deer in labor?
18Jb 39:2 Can you count the months they are pregnant so you can know the time they give birth?
18Jb 39:3 They crouch down to give birth to their young; they deliver their newborn.
18Jb 39:4 Their offspring are healthy and grow up in the open field. They leave and do not return.
18Jb 39:5 Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from its harness?
18Jb 39:6 I made the wilderness its home, and the salty wasteland its dwelling.
18Jb 39:7 It scoffs at the noise of the village and never hears the shouts of a driver.
18Jb 39:8 It roams the mountains for its pastureland, searching for anything green.
18Jb 39:9 Would the wild ox be willing to serve you? Would it spend the night by your feeding trough?
18Jb 39:10 Can you hold the wild ox by its harness to the furrow? Will it plow the valleys behind you?
18Jb 39:11 Can you depend on it because of its strength? Would you leave it to do your hard work?
18Jb 39:12 Can you trust the wild ox to harvest your grain and bring [it] to your threshing floor?
18Jb 39:13 The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but are her feathers and plumage like the stork's?
18Jb 39:14 She abandons her eggs on the ground and lets them be warmed in the sand.
18Jb 39:15 She forgets that a foot may crush them or that some wild animal may trample them.
18Jb 39:16 She treats her young harshly, as if [they] were not her own, with no fear that her labor may have been in vain.
18Jb 39:17 For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.
18Jb 39:18 When she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.
18Jb 39:19 Do you give strength to the horse? Do you adorn his neck with a mane?
18Jb 39:20 Do you make him leap like a locust? His proud snorting [fills one with] terror.
18Jb 39:21 He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; He charges into battle.
18Jb 39:22 He laughs at fear, since he is afraid of nothing; he does not run from the sword.
18Jb 39:23 A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and a lance.
18Jb 39:24 He charges ahead with trembling rage; he cannot stand still at the trumpet's sound.
18Jb 39:25 When the trumpet blasts, he snorts defiantly. He smells the battle from a distance; he hears the officers' shouts and the battle cry.
18Jb 39:26 Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread its wings to the south?
18Jb 39:27 Does the eagle soar at your command and make its nest on high?
18Jb 39:28 It lives on a cliff where it spends the night; its stronghold is on a rocky crag.
18Jb 39:29 From there it searches for prey; its eyes penetrate the distance.
18Jb 39:30 Its brood gulps down blood, and wherever corpses lie, it is there.
18Jb 40:1 The LORD answered Job:
18Jb 40:2 Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct [Him]? Let him who argues with God give an answer.
18Jb 40:3 Then Job answered the Lord:
18Jb 40:4 I am so insignificant. How can I answer You? I place my hand over my mouth.
18Jb 40:5 I have spoken once, and I will not reply; twice, but [now] I can add nothing.
18Jb 40:6 Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind:
18Jb 40:7 Get ready to answer Me like a man; When I question you, you will inform Me.
18Jb 40:8 Would you really challenge My justice? Would you declare Me guilty to justify yourself?
18Jb 40:9 Do you have an arm like God's? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
18Jb 40:10 Adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.
18Jb 40:11 Unleash your raging anger; look on every proud person and humiliate him.
18Jb 40:12 Look on every proud person and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.
18Jb 40:13 Hide them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.
18Jb 40:14 Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can deliver you.
18Jb 40:15 Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He eats grass like an ox.
18Jb 40:16 Look at the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.
18Jb 40:17 He stiffens his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are woven firmly together.
18Jb 40:18 His bones are bronze tubes; his limbs are like iron rods.
18Jb 40:19 He is the foremost of God's works; [only] his Maker can draw the sword against him.
18Jb 40:20 The hills yield food for him, while all [sorts of] wild animals play there.
18Jb 40:21 He lies under the lotus plants, hiding in the protection of marshy reeds.
18Jb 40:22 Lotus plants cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him.
18Jb 40:23 Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains confident, even if the Jordan surges up to his mouth.
18Jb 40:24 Can anyone capture him while he looks on, or pierce his nose with snares?
18Jb 41:1  Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie his tongue down with a rope?
18Jb 41:2 Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
18Jb 41:3 Will he beg you for mercy or speak softly to you?
18Jb 41:4 Will he make a covenant with you so that you can take him as a slave forever?
18Jb 41:5 Can you play with him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
18Jb 41:6 Will traders bargain for him or divide him among the merchants?
18Jb 41:7 Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
18Jb 41:8 Lay a hand on him. You will remember the battle and never repeat it!
18Jb 41:9  Any hope of [capturing] him proves false. Does a person not collapse at the very sight of him?
18Jb 41:10 No one is ferocious [enough] to rouse Leviathan; who then can stand against Me?
18Jb 41:11 Who confronted Me, that I should repay him? Everything under heaven belongs to Me.
18Jb 41:12 I cannot be silent about his limbs, his power, and his graceful proportions.
18Jb 41:13 Who can strip off his outer covering? Who can penetrate his double layer of armor?
18Jb 41:14 Who can open his jaws, surrounded by those terrifying teeth?
18Jb 41:15 [His] pride is in [his] rows of scales, closely sealed together.
18Jb 41:16 One scale is so close to another that no air can pass between them.
18Jb 41:17 They are joined to one another, so closely connected they cannot be separated.
18Jb 41:18 His snorting flashes with light, while his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
18Jb 41:19 Flaming torches shoot from his mouth; fiery sparks fly out!
18Jb 41:20 Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot or [burning] reeds.
18Jb 41:21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour out of his mouth.
18Jb 41:22 Strength resides in his neck, and dismay dances before him.
18Jb 41:23 The folds of his flesh are joined together, solid as metal and immovable.
18Jb 41:24 His heart is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!
18Jb 41:25 When Leviathan rises, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw because of [his] thrashing.
18Jb 41:26 The sword that reaches him will have no effect, nor will a spear, dart, or arrow.
18Jb 41:27 He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
18Jb 41:28 No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him.
18Jb 41:29 A club is regarded as stubble, and he laughs at the whirring of a javelin.
18Jb 41:30 His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading the mud like a threshing sledge.
18Jb 41:31 He makes the depths seethe like a caldron; he makes the sea like an ointment jar.
18Jb 41:32 He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!
18Jb 41:33 He has no equal on earth-- a creature devoid of fear!
18Jb 41:34 He surveys everything that is haughty; he is king over all the proud beasts.
18Jb 42:1 Then Job replied to the LORD:
18Jb 42:2 I know that You can do anything and no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
18Jb 42:3 [You asked,] "Who is this who conceals [My] counsel with ignorance?" Surely I spoke about things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
18Jb 42:4 [You said,] "Listen now, and I will speak. When I question you, you will inform Me."
18Jb 42:5 I had heard rumors about You, but now my eyes have seen You.
18Jb 42:6 Therefore I take back [my words] and repent in dust and ashes.
18Jb 42:7 After the LORD had finished speaking to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "I am angry with you and your two friends, for you have not spoken the truth about Me, as My servant Job has.
18Jb 42:8 Now take seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his [prayer] and not deal with you as your folly deserves. For you have not spoken the truth about Me, as My servant Job has."
18Jb 42:9 Then Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's [prayer].
18Jb 42:10 After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his prosperity and doubled his [previous] possessions.
18Jb 42:11 All his brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances came to his house and dined with him in his house. They offered him sympathy and comfort concerning all the adversity the LORD had brought on him. Each one gave him a qesitah, and a gold earring.
18Jb 42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the earlier. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
18Jb 42:13 He also had seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 42:14 He named his first [daughter] Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch.
18Jb 42:15 No women as beautiful as Job's daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance with their brothers.

19Ps 1:1 How happy is the man who does not follow the advice of the wicked, or take the path of sinners, or join a group of mockers!
19Ps 1:2 Instead, his delight is in the LORD's instruction, and he meditates on it day and night.

19Ps 2:5 Then He speaks to them in His anger and terrifies them in His wrath:
19Ps 2:6 "I have consecrated My King on Zion, My holy mountain."
19Ps 2:7 I will declare the LORD's decree: He said to Me, "You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.
19Ps 2:8 Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance and the ends of the earth Your possession.

19Ps 11:1 [For the choir director. Davidic.] I have taken refuge in the LORD. How can you say to me, "Escape to the mountain like a bird!

19Ps 13:3 Consider me and answer, LORD, my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death,

19Ps 13:6 I will sing to the LORD because He has treated me generously.
19Ps 14:1 [For the choir director. Davidic.] The fool says in his heart, "God does not exist." They are corrupt; their actions are revolting. There is no one who does good.
19Ps 14:2 The LORD looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God.
19Ps 14:3 All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one.

19Ps 15:1 [A Davidic psalm.] LORD, who can dwell in Your tent? Who can live on Your holy mountain?
19Ps 15:2 The one who lives honestly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart--
19Ps 15:3 who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor,
19Ps 15:4 who despises the one rejected by the LORD, but honors those who fear the LORD, who keeps his word whatever the cost,
19Ps 15:5 who does not lend his money at interest or take a bribe against the innocent-- the one who does these things will never be moved.

19Ps 16:3 As for the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.

19Ps 17:1 [A Davidic prayer.] LORD, hear a just cause; pay attention to my cry; listen to my prayer-- from lips free of deceit.
19Ps 17:2 Let my vindication come from You, [for] You see what is right.
19Ps 17:3 You have tested my heart; You have visited by night; You have tried me and found nothing [evil]; I have determined that my mouth will not sin.
19Ps 17:4 Concerning what people do: by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
19Ps 17:5 My steps are on Your paths; my feet have not slipped.
19Ps 17:6 I call on You, God, because You will answer me; listen closely to me; hear what I say.
19Ps 17:7 Display the wonders of Your faithful love, Savior of all who seek refuge from those who rebel against Your right hand.
19Ps 17:8 Guard me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings
19Ps 17:9 from the wicked who treat me violently, my deadly enemies who surround me.
19Ps 17:10 They have become hardened; their mouths speak arrogantly.
19Ps 17:11 They advance against me; now they surround me. They are determined to throw [me] to the ground.
19Ps 17:12 They are like a lion eager to tear, like a young lion lurking in ambush.
19Ps 17:13 Rise up, LORD! Confront him; bring him down. With Your sword, save me from the wicked.
19Ps 17:14 With Your hand, LORD, [save me] from men, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life: You fill their bellies with what You have in store, their sons are satisfied, and they leave their surplus to their children.
19Ps 17:15 But I will see Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.
19Ps 18:1 [For the choir director. Of the servant of the LORD, David, who spoke the words of this song to the LORD on the day the LORD rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:] I love You, LORD, my strength.
19Ps 18:2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my mountain where I seek refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
19Ps 18:3 I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I was saved from my enemies.
19Ps 18:4 The ropes of death were wrapped around me; the torrents of destruction terrified me.
19Ps 18:5 The ropes of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
19Ps 18:6 I called to the LORD in my distress, and I cried to my God for help. From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry to Him reached His ears.
19Ps 18:7 Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled; they shook because He burned with anger.
19Ps 18:8 Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire [came] from His mouth; coals were set ablaze by it.
19Ps 18:9 He parted the heavens and came down, a dark cloud beneath His feet.
19Ps 18:10 He rode on a cherub and flew, soaring on the wings of the wind.
19Ps 18:11 He made darkness His hiding place, dark storm clouds His canopy around Him.
19Ps 18:12 From the radiance of His presence, His clouds swept onward with hail and blazing coals.
19Ps 18:13 The LORD thundered from heaven; the Most High projected His voice.
19Ps 18:14 He shot His arrows and scattered them; He hurled lightning bolts and routed them.
19Ps 18:15 The depths of the sea became visible, the foundations of the world were exposed, at Your rebuke, LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
19Ps 18:16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He pulled me out of deep waters.
19Ps 18:17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
19Ps 18:18 They confronted me in the day of my distress, but the LORD was my support.
19Ps 18:19 He brought me out to a wide-open place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
19Ps 18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; He repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
19Ps 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not turned from my God to wickedness.
19Ps 18:22 Indeed, I have kept all His ordinances in mind and have not disregarded His statutes.
19Ps 18:23 I was blameless toward Him and kept myself from sinning.
19Ps 18:24 So the LORD repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
19Ps 18:25 With the faithful You prove Yourself faithful; with the blameless man You prove Yourself blameless;

19Ps 18:27 For You rescue an afflicted people, but You humble those with haughty eyes.

19Ps 18:39 You have clothed me with strength for battle; You subdue my adversaries beneath me.
19Ps 18:40 You have made my enemies retreat before me; I annihilate those who hate me.
19Ps 18:41 They cry for help, but there is no one to save [them]-- [they cry] to the LORD, but He does not answer them.
19Ps 18:42 I pulverize them like dust before the wind; I trample them like mud in the streets.
19Ps 18:43 You have freed me from the feuds among the people; You have appointed me the head of nations; a people I had not known serve me.
19Ps 18:44 Foreigners submit to me grudgingly; as soon as they hear, they obey me.

19Ps 19:3 There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard.
19Ps 19:4 Their message has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the inhabited world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.
19Ps 19:5 It is like a groom coming from the bridal chamber; it rejoices like an athlete running a course.
19Ps 19:6 It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat.
19Ps 19:7 The instruction of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise.

19Ps 19:11 In addition, Your servant is warned by them; there is great reward in keeping them.
19Ps 19:12 Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.

19Ps 35:13 Yet when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer was genuine.
19Ps 35:14 I went about [grieving] as if for my friend or brother; I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning a mother.

19Ps 35:26 Let those who rejoice at my misfortune be disgraced and humiliated; let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and reproach.
19Ps 35:27 Let those who want my vindication shout for joy and be glad; let them continually say, "The LORD be exalted, who wants His servant's well-being."
19Ps 35:28 And my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness, Your praise all day long.
19Ps 36:1 [For the choir director. [A psalm] of David, the LORD's servant.] An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked: There is no dread of God before his eyes,
19Ps 36:2 for in his own eyes he flatters himself [too much] to discover and hate his sin.
19Ps 36:3 The words of his mouth are malicious and deceptive; he has stopped acting wisely and doing good.
19Ps 36:4 Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good and does not reject evil.
19Ps 36:5 LORD, Your faithful love [reaches] to heaven, Your faithfulness to the skies.
19Ps 36:6 Your righteousness is like the highest mountain; Your judgments, like the deepest sea. LORD, You preserve man and beast.
19Ps 36:7 God, Your faithful love is so valuable that people take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
19Ps 36:8 They are filled from the abundance of Your house; You let them drink from Your refreshing stream,
19Ps 36:9 for with You is life's fountain. In Your light we will see light.
19Ps 36:10 Spread Your faithful love over those who know You, and Your righteousness over the upright in heart.
19Ps 36:11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant come near me or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19Ps 36:12 There the evildoers fall; they have been thrown down and cannot rise.
19Ps 37:1 [Davidic.] Do not be agitated by evildoers; do not envy those who do wrong.

19Ps 37:4 Take delight in the LORD, and He will give you your heart's desires.
19Ps 37:5 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will act,
19Ps 37:6 making your righteousness shine like the dawn, your justice like the noonday.
19Ps 37:7 Be silent before the LORD and wait expectantly for Him; do not be agitated by one who prospers in his way, by the man who carries out evil plans.
19Ps 37:8 Refrain from anger and give up [your] rage; do not be agitated-- it can only bring harm.
19Ps 37:9 For evildoers will be destroyed, but those who put their hope in the LORD will inherit the land.
19Ps 37:10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for him, he will not be there.
19Ps 37:11 But the humble will inherit the land and will enjoy abundant prosperity.
19Ps 37:12 The wicked schemes against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him.
19Ps 37:13 The Lord laughs at him because He sees that his day is coming.
19Ps 37:14 The wicked have drawn the sword and strung the bow to bring down the afflicted and needy and to slaughter those whose way is upright.
19Ps 37:15 Their swords will enter their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
19Ps 37:16 Better the little that the righteous man has than the abundance of many wicked people.
19Ps 37:17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD supports the righteous.
19Ps 37:18 The LORD watches over the blameless all their days, and their inheritance will last forever.
19Ps 37:19 They will not be disgraced in times of adversity; they will be satisfied in days of hunger.
19Ps 37:20 But the wicked will perish; the LORD's enemies, like the glory of the pastures, will fade away-- they will fade away like smoke.
19Ps 37:21 The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous is gracious and giving.
19Ps 37:22 Those who are blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be destroyed.
19Ps 37:23 A man's steps are established by the LORD, and He takes pleasure in his way.
19Ps 37:24 Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, because the LORD holds his hand.
19Ps 37:25 I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his children begging bread.
19Ps 37:26 He is always generous, always lending, and his children are a blessing.
19Ps 37:27 Turn away from evil and do what is good, and dwell there forever.
19Ps 37:28 For the LORD loves justice and will not abandon His faithful ones. They are kept safe forever, but the children of the wicked will be destroyed.
19Ps 37:29 The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it permanently.
19Ps 37:30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom; his tongue speaks what is just.
19Ps 37:31 The instruction of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter.
19Ps 37:32 The wicked lies in wait for the righteous and seeks to kill him;
19Ps 37:33 the LORD will not leave him in his hand or allow him to be condemned when he is judged.
19Ps 37:34 Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land. You will watch when the wicked are destroyed.
19Ps 37:35 I have seen a wicked, violent man well-rooted like a flourishing native tree.
19Ps 37:36 Then I passed by and noticed he was gone; I searched for him, but he could not be found.
19Ps 37:37 Watch the blameless and observe the upright, for the man of peace will have a future.
19Ps 37:38 But transgressors will all be eliminated; the future of the wicked will be destroyed.
19Ps 37:39 The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD, their refuge in a time of distress.
19Ps 37:40 The LORD helps and delivers them; He will deliver them from the wicked and will save them because they take refuge in Him.
19Ps 38:1 [A Davidic psalm for remembrance.] LORD, do not punish me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.
19Ps 38:2 For Your arrows have sunk into me, and Your hand has pressed down on me.
19Ps 38:3 There is no soundness in my body because of Your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
19Ps 38:4 For my sins have flooded over my head; they are a burden too heavy for me to bear.
19Ps 38:5 My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.
19Ps 38:6 I am bent over and brought low; all day long I go around in mourning.
19Ps 38:7 For my loins are full of burning pain, and there is no health in my body.
19Ps 38:8 I am faint and severely crushed; I groan because of the anguish of my heart.
19Ps 38:9 Lord, my every desire is known to You; my sighing is not hidden from You.
19Ps 38:10 My heart races, my strength leaves me, and even the light of my eyes has faded.
19Ps 38:11 My loved ones and friends stand back from my affliction, and my relatives stand at a distance.
19Ps 38:12 Those who seek my life set traps, and those who want to harm me threaten to destroy me; they plot treachery all day long.
19Ps 38:13 I am like a deaf person; I do not hear. I am like a speechless person who does not open his mouth.
19Ps 38:14 I am like a man who does not hear and has no arguments in his mouth.
19Ps 38:15 I put my hope in You, LORD; You will answer, Lord my God.
19Ps 38:16 For I said, "Don't let them rejoice over me-- those who are arrogant toward me when I stumble."
19Ps 38:17 For I am about to fall, and my pain is constantly with me.
19Ps 38:18 So I confess my guilt; I am anxious because of my sin.
19Ps 38:19 But my enemies are vigorous and powerful; many hate me for no reason.
19Ps 38:20 Those who repay evil for good attack me for pursuing good.
19Ps 38:21 LORD, do not abandon me; my God, do not be far from me.
19Ps 38:22 Hurry to help me, Lord, my Savior.
19Ps 39:1 [For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A Davidic psalm.] I said, "I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are in my presence."
19Ps 39:2 I was speechless and quiet; I kept silent, even from [speaking] good, and my pain intensified.
19Ps 39:3 My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, a fire burned. I spoke with my tongue:
19Ps 39:4 "LORD, reveal to me the end of my life and the number of my days. Let me know how transitory I am.
19Ps 39:5 You, indeed, have made my days short in length, and my life span as nothing in Your sight. Yes, every mortal man is only a vapor. Selah
19Ps 39:6 Certainly, man walks about like a mere shadow. Indeed, they frantically rush around in vain, gathering possessions without knowing who will get them.
19Ps 39:7 "Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.
19Ps 39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the taunt of fools.
19Ps 39:9 I am speechless; I do not open my mouth because of what You have done.
19Ps 39:10 Remove Your torment from me; I fade away because of the force of Your hand.
19Ps 39:11 You discipline a man with punishment for sin, consuming like a moth what is precious to him; every man is a mere vapor. Selah
19Ps 39:12 "Hear my prayer, LORD, and listen to my cry for help; do not be silent at my tears. For I am a foreigner residing with You, a sojourner like all my fathers.
19Ps 39:13 Turn Your angry gaze from me so that I may be cheered up before I die and am gone."
19Ps 40:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] I waited patiently for the LORD, and He turned to me and heard my cry for help.
19Ps 40:2 He brought me up from a desolate pit, out of the muddy clay, and set my feet on a rock, making my steps secure.
19Ps 40:3 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the LORD.
19Ps 40:4 How happy is the man who has put his trust in the LORD and has not turned to the proud or to those who run after lies!
19Ps 40:5 LORD my God, You have done many things-- Your wonderful works and Your plans for us; none can compare with You. If I were to report and speak [of them], they are more than can be told.
19Ps 40:6 You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; You open my ears to listen. You do not ask for a whole burnt offering or a sin offering.
19Ps 40:7 Then I said, "See, I have come; it is written about me in the volume of the scroll.
19Ps 40:8 I delight to do Your will, my God; Your instruction resides within me."
19Ps 40:9 I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; see, I do not keep my mouth closed-- as You know, LORD.
19Ps 40:10 I did not hide Your righteousness in my heart; I spoke about Your faithfulness and salvation; I did not conceal Your constant love and truth from the great assembly.
19Ps 40:11 LORD, do not withhold Your compassion from me; Your constant love and truth will always guard me.
19Ps 40:12 For troubles without number have surrounded me; my sins have overtaken me; I am unable to see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my courage leaves me.
19Ps 40:13 LORD, be pleased to deliver me; hurry to help me, LORD.
19Ps 40:14 Let those who seek to take my life be disgraced and confounded. Let those who wish me harm be driven back and humiliated.
19Ps 40:15 Let those who say to me, "Aha, aha!" be horrified because of their shame.
19Ps 40:16 Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; let those who love Your salvation continually say, The LORD is great!"
19Ps 40:17 I am afflicted and needy; the Lord thinks of me. You are my help and my deliverer; my God, do not delay.
19Ps 41:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] Happy is one who cares for the poor; the LORD will save him in a day of adversity.
19Ps 41:2 The LORD will keep him and preserve him; he will be blessed in the land. You will not give him over to the desire of his enemies.
19Ps 41:3 The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed; You will heal him on the bed where he lies.
19Ps 41:4 I said, "LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You."
19Ps 41:5 My enemies speak maliciously about me: "When will he die and be forgotten?"
19Ps 41:6 When one [of them] comes to visit, he speaks deceitfully; he stores up evil in his heart; he goes out and talks.
19Ps 41:7 All who hate me whisper together about me; they plan to harm me.
19Ps 41:8 "Lethal poison has been poured into him, and he won't rise again from where he lies!"
19Ps 41:9 Even my friend in whom I trusted, one who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
19Ps 41:10 But You, LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up; then I will repay them.
19Ps 41:11 By this I know that You delight in me: my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
19Ps 41:12 You supported me because of my integrity and set me in Your presence forever.
19Ps 41:13 May the LORD, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.
19Ps 42:1 [ For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.] As a deer longs for streams of water, so I long for You, God.
19Ps 42:2 I thirst for God, the living God. When can I come and appear before God?
19Ps 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while all day long people say to me, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:4 I remember this as I pour out my heart: how I walked with many, leading the festive procession to the house of God, with joyful and thankful shouts.
19Ps 42:5 Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
19Ps 42:6 I am deeply depressed; therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
19Ps 42:7 Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and Your billows have swept over me.
19Ps 42:8 The LORD will send His faithful love by day; His song will be with me in the night-- a prayer to the God of my life.
19Ps 42:9 I will say to God, my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy's oppression?"
19Ps 42:10 My adversaries taunt me, as if crushing my bones, while all day long they say to me, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:11 Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
19Ps 43:1 Vindicate me, God, and defend my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man.
19Ps 43:2 For You are the God of my refuge. Why have You rejected me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy's oppression?
19Ps 43:3 Send Your light and Your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to Your holy mountain, to Your dwelling place.
19Ps 43:4 Then I will come to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise You with the lyre, God, my God.
19Ps 43:5 Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
19Ps 44:1 [For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.] God, we have heard with our ears-- our forefathers have told us-- the work You accomplished in their days, in days long ago:
19Ps 44:2 to plant them, You drove out the nations with Your hand; to settle them, You crushed the peoples.
19Ps 44:3 For they did not take the land by their sword-- their arm did not bring them victory-- but by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, for You were pleased with them.
19Ps 44:4 You are my King, my God, who ordains victories for Jacob.
19Ps 44:5 Through You we drive back our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.
19Ps 44:6 For I do not trust in my bow, and my sword does not bring me victory.
19Ps 44:7 But You give us victory over our foes and let those who hate us be disgraced.
19Ps 44:8 We boast in God all day long; we will praise Your name forever. Selah
19Ps 44:9 But You have rejected and humiliated us; You do not march out with our armies.
19Ps 44:10 You make us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have taken plunder for themselves.
19Ps 44:11 You hand us over to be eaten like sheep and scatter us among the nations.
19Ps 44:12 You sell Your people for nothing; You make no profit from selling them.
19Ps 44:13 You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.
19Ps 44:14 You make us a joke among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
19Ps 44:15 My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face,
19Ps 44:16 because of the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy and avenger.
19Ps 44:17 All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.
19Ps 44:18 Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.
19Ps 44:19 But You have crushed us in a haunt of jackals and have covered us with deepest darkness.
19Ps 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19Ps 44:21 wouldn't God have found this out, since He knows the secrets of the heart?
19Ps 44:22 Because of You we are slain all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
19Ps 44:23 Wake up, LORD! Why are You sleeping? Get up! Don't reject us forever!
19Ps 44:24 Why do You hide Yourself and forget our affliction and oppression?
19Ps 44:25 For we have sunk down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
19Ps 44:26 Rise up! Help us! Redeem us because of Your faithful love.
19Ps 45:1 [For the choir director: according to "The Lilies." A Maskil of the sons of Korah. A love song.] My heart is moved by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
19Ps 45:2 You are the most handsome of men; grace flows from your lips. Therefore God has blessed you forever.
19Ps 45:3 Mighty warrior, strap your sword at your side. In your majesty and splendor--
19Ps 45:4 in your splendor ride triumphantly in the cause of truth, humility, and justice. May your right hand show your awe-inspiring deeds.
19Ps 45:5 Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you.
19Ps 45:6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
19Ps 45:7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you, more than your companions, with the oil of joy.
19Ps 45:8 Myrrh, aloes, and cassia [perfume] all your garments; from ivory palaces harps bring you joy.
19Ps 45:9 Kings' daughters are among your honored women; the queen, adorned with gold from Ophir, stands at your right hand.
19Ps 45:10 Listen, daughter, pay attention and consider: forget your people and your father's house,
19Ps 45:11 and the king will desire your beauty. Bow down to him, for he is your lord.
19Ps 45:12 The daughter of Tyre, the wealthy people, will seek your favor with gifts.
19Ps 45:13 In [her chamber], the royal daughter is all glorious, her clothing embroidered with gold.
19Ps 45:14 In colorful garments she is led to the king; after her, the virgins, her companions, are brought to you.
19Ps 45:15 They are led in with gladness and rejoicing; they enter the king's palace.
19Ps 45:16 Your sons will succeed your ancestors; you will make them princes throughout the land.
19Ps 45:17 I will cause your name to be remembered for all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
19Ps 46:1 [For the choir director. A song of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth.] God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble.
19Ps 46:2 Therefore we will not be afraid, though the earth trembles and the mountains topple into the depths of the seas,
19Ps 46:3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with its turmoil. Selah
19Ps 46:4 [There is] a river-- its streams delight the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
19Ps 46:5 God is within her; she will not be toppled. God will help her when the morning dawns.
19Ps 46:6 Nations rage, kingdoms topple; the earth melts when He lifts His voice.
19Ps 46:7 The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah
19Ps 46:8 Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation on the earth.
19Ps 46:9 He makes wars cease throughout the earth. He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces; He burns up the chariots.
19Ps 46:10 "Stop [your fighting]-- and know that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth."
19Ps 46:11 The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah
19Ps 47:1 [ For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with a jubilant cry.
19Ps 47:2 For the LORD Most High is awe-inspiring, a great King over all the earth.
19Ps 47:3 He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet.
19Ps 47:4 He chooses for us our inheritance-- the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah
19Ps 47:5 God ascends amid shouts of joy, the LORD, amid the sound of trumpets.
19Ps 47:6 Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise!
19Ps 47:7 Sing a song of instruction, for God is King of all the earth.
19Ps 47:8 God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.
19Ps 47:9 The nobles of the peoples have assembled [with] the people of the God of Abraham. For the leaders of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.
19Ps 48:1 [A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] The LORD is great and is highly praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
19Ps 48:2 rising splendidly, is the joy of the whole earth. Mount Zion on the slopes of the north is the city of the great King.
19Ps 48:3 God is known as a stronghold in its citadels.
19Ps 48:4 Look! The kings assembled; they advanced together.
19Ps 48:5 They looked, and froze with fear; they fled in terror.
19Ps 48:6 Trembling seized them there, agony like that of a woman in labor,
19Ps 48:7 as You wrecked the ships of Tarshish with the east wind.
19Ps 48:8 Just as we heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it forever. Selah
19Ps 48:9 God, within Your temple, we contemplate Your faithful love.
19Ps 48:10 Your name, God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with justice.
19Ps 48:11 Mount Zion is glad. The towns of Judah rejoice because of Your judgments.
19Ps 48:12 Go around Zion, encircle it; count its towers,
19Ps 48:13 note its ramparts; tour its citadels so that you can tell a future generation:
19Ps 48:14 "This God, our God forever and ever-- He will lead us eternally."
19Ps 49:1 [For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who inhabit the world,
19Ps 49:2 both low and high, rich and poor together.
19Ps 49:3 My mouth speaks wisdom; my heart's meditation [brings] understanding.
19Ps 49:4 I turn my ear to a proverb; I explain my riddle with a lyre.
19Ps 49:5 Why should I fear in times of trouble? The iniquity of my foes surrounds me.
19Ps 49:6 They trust in their wealth and boast of their abundant riches.
19Ps 49:7 Yet these cannot redeem a person or pay his ransom to God--
19Ps 49:8 since the price of redeeming him is too costly, one should forever stop trying--
19Ps 49:9 so that he may live forever and not see the Pit.
19Ps 49:10 For one can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless also pass away. Then they leave their wealth to others.
19Ps 49:11 Their graves are their eternal homes, their homes from generation to generation, though they have named estates after themselves.
19Ps 49:12 But despite [his] assets, man will not last; he is like the animals that perish.
19Ps 49:13 This is the way of those who are arrogant, and of their followers, who approve of their words. Selah
19Ps 49:14 Like sheep they are headed for Sheol; Death will shepherd them. The upright will rule over them in the morning, and their form will waste away in Sheol, far from their lofty abode.
19Ps 49:15 But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol, for He will take me. Selah
19Ps 49:16 Do not be afraid when a man gets rich, when the wealth of his house increases.
19Ps 49:17 For when he dies, he will take nothing at all; his wealth will not follow him down.
19Ps 49:18 Though he praises himself during his lifetime-- and people praise you when you do well for yourself--
19Ps 49:19 he will go to the generation of his fathers; they will never see the light.
19Ps 49:20 A man with valuable possessions but without understanding is like the animals that perish.
19Ps 50:1 [A psalm of Asaph.] God, the LORD God speaks; He summons the earth from east to west.
19Ps 50:2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God appears in radiance.
19Ps 50:3 Our God is coming; He will not be silent! Devouring fire precedes Him, and a storm rages around Him.
19Ps 50:4 On high, He summons heaven and earth in order to judge His people.
19Ps 50:5 "Gather My faithful ones to Me, those who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."
19Ps 50:6 The heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God is the judge. Selah
19Ps 50:7 "Listen, My people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel. I am God, your God.
19Ps 50:8 I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or for your burnt offerings, which are continually before Me.
19Ps 50:9 I will not accept a bull from your household or male goats from your pens,
19Ps 50:10 for every animal of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
19Ps 50:11 I know every bird of the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.
19Ps 50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and everything in it is Mine.
19Ps 50:13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19Ps 50:14 Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and pay your vows to the Most High.
19Ps 50:15 Call on Me in a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor Me."
19Ps 50:16 But God says to the wicked: "What right do you have to recite My statutes and to take My covenant on your lips?
19Ps 50:17 You hate instruction and turn your back on My words.
19Ps 50:18 When you see a thief, you make friends with him, and you associate with adulterers.
19Ps 50:19 You unleash your mouth for evil and harness your tongue for deceit.
19Ps 50:20 You sit, maligning your brother, slandering your mother's son.
19Ps 50:21 You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But I will rebuke you and lay out the case before you.
19Ps 50:22 "Understand this, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and there will be no rescuer.
19Ps 50:23 Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and whoever orders his conduct, I will show him the salvation of God."
19Ps 51:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm, when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba.] Be gracious to me, God, according to Your faithful love; according to Your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion.
19Ps 51:2 Wash away my guilt, and cleanse me from my sin.
19Ps 51:3 For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me.
19Ps 51:4 Against You-- You alone-- I have sinned and done this evil in Your sight. So You are right when You pass sentence; You are blameless when You judge.
19Ps 51:5 Indeed, I was guilty [when I] was born; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
19Ps 51:6 Surely You desire integrity in the inner self, and You teach me wisdom deep within.
19Ps 51:7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
19Ps 51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
19Ps 51:9 Turn Your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt.
19Ps 51:10 God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19Ps 51:11 Do not banish me from Your presence or take Your Holy Spirit from me.
19Ps 51:12 Restore the joy of Your salvation to me, and give me a willing spirit.
19Ps 51:13 Then I will teach the rebellious Your ways, and sinners will return to You.
19Ps 51:14 Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
19Ps 51:15 Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
19Ps 51:16 You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; You are not pleased with a burnt offering.
19Ps 51:17 The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. God, You will not despise a broken and humbled heart.
19Ps 51:18 In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build the walls of Jerusalem.
19Ps 51:19 Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
19Ps 52:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic Maskil. When Doeg the Edomite went and reported to Saul, telling him, "David went to Ahimelech's house."] Why brag about evil, you hero! God's faithful love is constant.
19Ps 52:2 Like a sharpened razor, your tongue devises destruction, working treachery.
19Ps 52:3 You love evil instead of good, lying instead of speaking truthfully. Selah
19Ps 52:4 You love any words that destroy, you treacherous tongue!
19Ps 52:5 This is why God will bring you down forever. He will take you, ripping you out of your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
19Ps 52:6 The righteous will look on with awe and will ridicule him:
19Ps 52:7 "Here is the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, taking refuge in his destructive behavior."
19Ps 52:8 But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God's faithful love forever and ever.
19Ps 52:9 I will praise You forever for what You have done. In the presence of Your faithful people, I will put my hope in Your name, for it is good.
19Ps 53:1 [For the choir director: on Mahalath. A Davidic Maskil.] The fool says in his heart, "God does not exist." They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good.
19Ps 53:2 God looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise and who seeks God.
19Ps 53:3 Everyone has turned aside; they have all become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one.
19Ps 53:4 Will evildoers never understand? They consume My people as they consume bread; they do not call on God.
19Ps 53:5 Then they will be filled with terror-- terror like no other-- because God will scatter the bones of those who besiege you. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
19Ps 53:6 Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come from Zion! When God restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
19Ps 54:1 [For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Davidic Maskil. When the Ziphites went and said to Saul, "Is David not hiding among us?"] God, save me by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might!
19Ps 54:2 God, hear my prayer; listen to the words of my mouth.
19Ps 54:3 For strangers rise up against me, and violent men seek my life. They have no regard for God. Selah
19Ps 54:4 God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my life.
19Ps 54:5 He will repay my adversaries for [their] evil. Because of Your faithfulness, annihilate them.
19Ps 54:6 I will sacrifice a freewill offering to You. I will praise Your name, LORD, because it is good.
19Ps 54:7 For He has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked down on my enemies.
19Ps 55:1 [For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Davidic Maskil.] God, listen to my prayer and do not ignore my plea for help.
19Ps 55:2 Pay attention to me and answer me. I am restless and in turmoil with my complaint,
19Ps 55:3 because of the enemy's voice, because of the pressure of the wicked. For they bring down disaster on me and harass me in anger.
19Ps 55:4 My heart shudders within me; terrors of death sweep over me.
19Ps 55:5 Fear and trembling grip me; horror has overwhelmed me.
19Ps 55:6 I said, "If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
19Ps 55:7 How far away I would flee; I would stay in the wilderness. Selah
19Ps 55:8 I would hurry to my shelter from the raging wind and the storm."
19Ps 55:9 Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city;
19Ps 55:10 day and night they make the rounds on its walls. Crime and trouble are within it;
19Ps 55:11 destruction is inside it; oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace.
19Ps 55:12 Now, it is not an enemy who insults me-- otherwise I could bear it; it is not a foe who rises up against me-- otherwise I could hide from him.
19Ps 55:13 But it is you, a man who is my peer, my companion and good friend!
19Ps 55:14 We used to have close fellowship; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
19Ps 55:15 Let death take them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, because evil is in their homes and within them.
19Ps 55:16 But I call to God, and the LORD will save me.
19Ps 55:17 I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and He hears my voice.
19Ps 55:18 Though many are against me, He will redeem me from my battle unharmed.
19Ps 55:19 God, the One enthroned from long ago, will hear, and will humiliate them Selah because they do not change and do not fear God.
19Ps 55:20 He acts violently against those at peace with him; he violates his covenant.
19Ps 55:21 His buttery words are smooth, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.
19Ps 55:22 Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will support you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
19Ps 55:23 You, God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and treachery will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
19Ps 56:1 [For the choir director: according to "A Silent Dove Far Away." A Davidic Miktam. When the Philistines seized him in Gath.] Be gracious to me, God, for man tramples me; he fights and oppresses me all day long.
19Ps 56:2 My adversaries trample me all day, for many arrogantly fight against me.
19Ps 56:3 When I am afraid, I will trust in You.
19Ps 56:4 In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
19Ps 56:5 They twist my words all day long; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
19Ps 56:6 They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.
19Ps 56:7 Will they escape in spite of such sin? God, bring down the nations in wrath.
19Ps 56:8 You Yourself have recorded my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your records?
19Ps 56:9 Then my enemies will retreat on the day when I call. This I know: God is for me.
19Ps 56:10 In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
19Ps 56:11 in God I trust; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
19Ps 56:12 I am obligated by vows to You, God; I will make my thank offerings to You.
19Ps 56:13 For You delivered me from death, even my feet from stumbling, to walk before God in the light of life.
19Ps 57:1 [For the choir director: "Do Not Destroy." A Davidic Miktam. When he fled before Saul into the cave.] Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, for I take refuge in You. I will seek refuge in the shadow of Your wings until danger passes.
19Ps 57:2 I call to God Most High, to God who fulfills [His purpose] for me.
19Ps 57:3 He reaches down from heaven and saves me, challenging the one who tramples me. Selah God sends His faithful love and truth.
19Ps 57:4 I am in the midst of lions; I lie down with those who devour men. Their teeth are spears and arrows; their tongues are sharp swords.
19Ps 57:5 God, be exalted above the heavens; let Your glory be above the whole earth.
19Ps 57:6 They prepared a net for my steps; I was downcast. They dug a pit ahead of me, but they fell into it! Selah
19Ps 57:7 My heart is confident, God, my heart is confident. I will sing; I will sing praises.
19Ps 57:8 Wake up, my soul! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.
19Ps 57:9 I will praise You, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.
19Ps 57:10 For Your faithful love is as high as the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
19Ps 57:11 God, be exalted above the heavens; let Your glory be over the whole earth.
19Ps 58:1 [For the choir director: "Do Not Destroy." A Davidic Miktam.] Do you really speak righteously, you mighty ones? Do you judge people fairly?
19Ps 58:2 No, you practice injustice in your hearts; with your hands you weigh out violence in the land.
19Ps 58:3 The wicked go astray from the womb; liars err from birth.
19Ps 58:4 They have venom like the venom of a snake, like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears,
19Ps 58:5 that does not listen to the sound of the charmers who skillfully weave spells.
19Ps 58:6 God, knock the teeth out of their mouths; LORD, tear out the young lions' fangs.
19Ps 58:7 They will vanish like water that flows by; they will aim their useless arrows.
19Ps 58:8 Like a slug that moves along in slime, like a woman's miscarried [child], they will not see the sun.
19Ps 58:9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns-- whether green or burning-- He will sweep them away.
19Ps 58:10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the retribution; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
19Ps 58:11 Then people will say, "Yes, there is a reward for the righteous! There is a God who judges on earth!"
19Ps 59:1 [For the choir director: "Do Not Destroy." A Davidic Miktam. When Saul sent [agents] to watch the house and kill him.] Deliver me from my enemies, my God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
19Ps 59:2 Deliver me from those who practice sin, and save me from men of bloodshed.
19Ps 59:3 LORD, look! They set an ambush for me. Powerful men attack me, but not because of any sin or rebellion of mine.
19Ps 59:4 For no fault of mine, they run and take up a position. Awake to help me, and take notice.
19Ps 59:5 You, LORD God of Hosts, God of Israel, rise up to punish all the nations; do not show grace to any wicked traitors. Selah
19Ps 59:6 They return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
19Ps 59:7 Look, they spew from their mouths-- sharp words from their lips. "For who," [they say,] "will hear?"
19Ps 59:8 But You laugh at them, LORD; You ridicule all the nations.
19Ps 59:9 I will keep watch for You, my strength, because God is my stronghold.
19Ps 59:10 My faithful God will come to meet me; God will let me look down on my adversaries.
19Ps 59:11 Do not kill them; otherwise, my people will forget. By Your power, make them homeless wanderers and bring them down, Lord, our shield.
19Ps 59:12 The sin of their mouths is the word of their lips, so let them be caught in their pride. They utter curses and lies.
19Ps 59:13 Consume [them] in rage; consume [them] until they are gone. Then they will know to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
19Ps 59:14 And they return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
19Ps 59:15 They scavenge for food; they growl if they are not satisfied.
19Ps 59:16 But I will sing of Your strength and will joyfully proclaim Your faithful love in the morning. For You have been a stronghold for me, a refuge in my day of trouble.
19Ps 59:17 To You, my strength, I sing praises, because God is my stronghold-- my faithful God.
19Ps 60:1 [For the choir director: according to "The Lily of Testimony." A Davidic Miktam for teaching. When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in the Valley of Salt, [killing] 12,000.] God, You have rejected us; You have broken out against us; You have been angry. Restore us!
19Ps 60:2 You have shaken the land and split it open. Heal its fissures, for it shudders.
19Ps 60:3 You have made Your people suffer hardship; You have given us a wine to drink that made us stagger.
19Ps 60:4 You have given a signal flag to those who fear You, so that they can flee before the archers. Selah
19Ps 60:5 Save with Your right hand, and answer me, so that those You love may be rescued.
19Ps 60:6 God has spoken in His sanctuary: "I will triumph! I will divide up Shechem. I will apportion the Valley of Succoth.
19Ps 60:7 Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is My helmet; Judah is My scepter.
19Ps 60:8 Moab is My washbasin; on Edom I throw My sandal. Over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19Ps 60:9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19Ps 60:10 Is it not You, God, who have rejected us? God, You do not march out with our armies.
19Ps 60:11 Give us aid against the foe, for human help is worthless.
19Ps 60:12 With God we will perform valiantly; He will trample our foes.
19Ps 61:1 [For the choir director: on stringed instruments. Davidic.] God, hear my cry; pay attention to my prayer.
19Ps 61:2 I call to You from the ends of the earth when my heart is without strength. Lead me to a rock that is high above me,
19Ps 61:3 for You have been a refuge for me, a strong tower in the face of the enemy.
19Ps 61:4 I will live in Your tent forever and take refuge under the shelter of Your wings. Selah
19Ps 61:5 God, You have heard my vows; You have given a heritage to those who fear Your name.
19Ps 61:6 Add days to the king's life; may his years span many generations.
19Ps 61:7 May he sit enthroned before God forever; appoint faithful love and truth to guard him.
19Ps 61:8 Then I will continually sing of Your name, fulfilling my vows day by day.
19Ps 62:1 [For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. A Davidic psalm.] I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from Him.
19Ps 62:2 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will never be shaken.
19Ps 62:3 How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you attack as if he were a leaning wall or a tottering stone fence?
19Ps 62:4 They only plan to bring him down from his high position. They take pleasure in lying; they bless with their mouths, but they curse inwardly. Selah
19Ps 62:5 Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
19Ps 62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will not be shaken.
19Ps 62:7 My salvation and glory depend on God; my strong rock, my refuge, is in God.
19Ps 62:8 Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah
19Ps 62:9 Men are only a vapor; exalted men, an illusion. On a balance scale, they go up; together they [weigh] less than a vapor.
19Ps 62:10 Place no trust in oppression, or false hope in robbery. If wealth increases, pay no attention to it.
19Ps 62:11 God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: strength belongs to God,
19Ps 62:12 and faithful love belongs to You, LORD. For You repay each according to his works.
19Ps 63:1 [A Davidic psalm. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah.] God, You are my God; I eagerly seek You. I thirst for You; my body faints for You in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water.
19Ps 63:2 So I gaze on You in the sanctuary to see Your strength and Your glory.
19Ps 63:3 My lips will glorify You because Your faithful love is better than life.
19Ps 63:4 So I will praise You as long as I live; at Your name, I will lift up my hands.
19Ps 63:5 You satisfy me as with rich food; my mouth will praise You with joyful lips.
19Ps 63:6 When, on my bed, I think of You, I meditate on You during the night watches
19Ps 63:7 because You are my help; I will rejoice in the shadow of Your wings.
19Ps 63:8 I follow close to You; Your right hand holds on to me.
19Ps 63:9 But those who seek to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth.
19Ps 63:10 They will be given over to the power of the sword; they will become the jackals' prey.
19Ps 63:11 But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will boast, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
19Ps 64:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] God, hear my voice when I complain. Protect my life from the terror of the enemy.
19Ps 64:2 Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of evildoers,
19Ps 64:3 who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim bitter words like arrows,
19Ps 64:4 shooting from concealed places at the innocent. They shoot at him suddenly and are not afraid.
19Ps 64:5 They encourage each other in an evil plan; they talk about hiding traps and say, "Who will see them?"
19Ps 64:6 They devise crimes [and say,] "We have perfected a secret plan." The inner man and the heart are mysterious.
19Ps 64:7 But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly, they will be wounded.
19Ps 64:8 They will be made to stumble; their own tongues work against them. All who see them will shake their heads.
19Ps 64:9 Then everyone will fear and will tell about God's work, for they will understand what He has done.
19Ps 64:10 The righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; all the upright in heart offer praise.
19Ps 65:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm. A song.] Praise is rightfully Yours, God, in Zion; vows to You will be fulfilled.
19Ps 65:2 All humanity will come to You, the One who hears prayer.
19Ps 65:3 Iniquities overwhelm me; only You can atone for our rebellions.
19Ps 65:4 How happy is the one You choose and bring near to live in Your courts! We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.
19Ps 65:5 You answer us in righteousness, with awe-inspiring works, God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the distant seas;
19Ps 65:6 You establish the mountains by Your power, robed with strength;
19Ps 65:7 You silence the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.
19Ps 65:8 Those who live far away are awed by Your signs; You make east and west shout for joy.
19Ps 65:9 You visit the earth and water it abundantly, enriching it greatly. God's stream is filled with water, for You prepare the earth in this way, providing [people] with grain.
19Ps 65:10 You soften it with showers and bless its growth, soaking its furrows and leveling its ridges.
19Ps 65:11 You crown the year with Your goodness; Your ways overflow with plenty.
19Ps 65:12 The wilderness pastures overflow, and the hills are robed with joy.
19Ps 65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks, and the valleys covered with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
19Ps 66:1 [For the choir director. A song. A psalm.] Shout joyfully to God, all the earth!
19Ps 66:2 Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.
19Ps 66:3 Say to God, "How awe-inspiring are Your works! Your enemies will cringe before You because of Your great strength.
19Ps 66:4 All the earth will worship You and sing praise to You. They will sing praise to Your name." Selah
19Ps 66:5 Come and see the works of God; His acts toward mankind are awe-inspiring.
19Ps 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land, and they crossed the river on foot. There we rejoiced in Him.
19Ps 66:7 He rules forever by His might; He keeps His eye on the nations. The rebellious should not exalt themselves. Selah
19Ps 66:8 Praise our God, you peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.
19Ps 66:9 He keeps us alive and does not allow our feet to slip.
19Ps 66:10 For You, God, tested us; You refined us as silver is refined.
19Ps 66:11 You lured us into a trap; You placed burdens on our backs.
19Ps 66:12 You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us out to abundance.
19Ps 66:13 I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows
19Ps 66:14 that my lips promised and my mouth spoke during my distress.
19Ps 66:15 I will offer You fattened sheep as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will sacrifice oxen with goats. Selah
19Ps 66:16 Come and listen, all who fear God, and I will tell what He has done for me.
19Ps 66:17 I cried out to Him with my mouth, and praise was on my tongue.
19Ps 66:18 If I had been aware of malice in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
19Ps 66:19 However, God has listened; He has paid attention to the sound of my prayer.
19Ps 66:20 May God be praised! He has not turned away my prayer or turned His faithful love from me.
19Ps 67:1 [For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.] May God be gracious to us and bless us; look on us with favor Selah
19Ps 67:2 so that Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
19Ps 67:3 Let the peoples praise You, God; let all the peoples praise You.
19Ps 67:4 Let the nations rejoice and shout for joy, for You judge the peoples with fairness and lead the nations on earth. Selah
19Ps 67:5 Let the peoples praise You, God, let all the peoples praise You.
19Ps 67:6 The earth has produced its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.
19Ps 67:7 God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear Him.
19Ps 68:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm. A song.] God arises. His enemies scatter, and those who hate Him flee from His presence.
19Ps 68:2 As smoke is blown away, so You blow [them] away. As wax melts before the fire, so the wicked are destroyed before God.
19Ps 68:3 But the righteous are glad; they rejoice before God and celebrate with joy.
19Ps 68:4 Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds-- His name is Yahweh-- and rejoice before Him.
19Ps 68:5 A father of the fatherless and a champion of widows is God in His holy dwelling.
19Ps 68:6 God provides homes for those who are deserted. He leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious live in a scorched land.
19Ps 68:7 God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the desert, Selah
19Ps 68:8 the earth trembled, and the skies poured down [rain] before God, the God of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
19Ps 68:9 You, God, showered abundant rain; You revived Your inheritance when it languished.
19Ps 68:10 Your people settled in it; by Your goodness You provided for the poor, God.
19Ps 68:11 The Lord gave the command; a great company of women brought the good news:
19Ps 68:12 "The kings of the armies flee-- they flee!" She who stays at home divides the spoil.
19Ps 68:13 While you lie among the sheepfolds, the wings of a dove are covered with silver, and its feathers with glistening gold.
19Ps 68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in the land, it snowed on Zalmon.
19Ps 68:15 Mount Bashan is God's towering mountain; Mount Bashan is a mountain of many peaks.
19Ps 68:16 Why gaze with envy, you mountain peaks, at the mountain God desired for His dwelling? The LORD will live [there] forever!
19Ps 68:17 God's chariots are tens of thousands, thousands and thousands; the Lord is among them in the sanctuary as He was at Sinai.
19Ps 68:18 You ascended to the heights, taking away captives; You received gifts from people, even from the rebellious, so that the LORD God might live [there].
19Ps 68:19 May the Lord be praised! Day after day He bears our burdens; God is our salvation. Selah
19Ps 68:20 Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.
19Ps 68:21 Surely God crushes the heads of His enemies, the hairy head of one who goes on in his guilty acts.
19Ps 68:22 The Lord said, "I will bring [them] back from Bashan; I will bring [them] back from the depths of the sea
19Ps 68:23 so that your foot may wade in blood and your dogs' tongues may have their share from the enemies."
19Ps 68:24 People have seen Your procession, God, the procession of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
19Ps 68:25 Singers lead the way, with musicians following; among them are young women playing tambourines.
19Ps 68:26 Praise God in the assemblies; [praise] the LORD from the fountain of Israel.
19Ps 68:27 There is Benjamin, the youngest, leading them, the rulers of Judah in their assembly, the rulers of Zebulun, the rulers of Naphtali.
19Ps 68:28 Your God has decreed your strength. Show Your strength, God, You who have acted on our behalf.
19Ps 68:29 Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, kings will bring tribute to You.
19Ps 68:30 Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those with bars of silver. Scatter the peoples who take pleasure in war.
19Ps 68:31 Ambassadors will come from Egypt; Cush will stretch out its hands to God.
19Ps 68:32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth; sing praise to the Lord, Selah
19Ps 68:33 to Him who rides in the ancient, highest heavens. Look, He thunders with His powerful voice!
19Ps 68:34 Ascribe power to God. His majesty is over Israel, His power among the clouds.
19Ps 68:35 God, You are awe-inspiring in Your sanctuaries. The God of Israel gives power and strength to His people. May God be praised!
19Ps 69:1 [For the choir director: according to "The Lilies." Davidic.] Save me, God, for the water has risen to my neck.
19Ps 69:2 I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no footing; I have come into deep waters, and a flood sweeps over me.
19Ps 69:3 I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
19Ps 69:4 Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head; my deceitful enemies, who would destroy me, are powerful. Though I did not steal, I must repay.
19Ps 69:5 God, You know my foolishness, and my guilty acts are not hidden from You.
19Ps 69:6 Do not let those who put their hope in You be disgraced because of me, Lord God of Hosts; do not let those who seek You be humiliated because of me, God of Israel.
19Ps 69:7 For I have endured insults because of You, and shame has covered my face.
19Ps 69:8 I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother's sons
19Ps 69:9 because zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.
19Ps 69:10 I mourned and fasted, but it brought me insults.
19Ps 69:11 I wore sackcloth as my clothing, and I was a joke to them.
19Ps 69:12 Those who sit at the city gate talk about me, and drunkards make up songs about me.
19Ps 69:13 But as for me, LORD, my prayer to You is for a time of favor. In Your abundant, faithful love, God, answer me with Your sure salvation.
19Ps 69:14 Rescue me from the miry mud; don't let me sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me, and from the deep waters.
19Ps 69:15 Don't let the floodwaters sweep over me or the deep swallow me up; don't let the Pit close its mouth over me.
19Ps 69:16 Answer me, LORD, for Your faithful love is good; in keeping with Your great compassion, turn to me.
19Ps 69:17 Don't hide Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly!
19Ps 69:18 Draw near to me and redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies.
19Ps 69:19 You know the insults I endure-- my shame and disgrace. You are aware of all my adversaries.
19Ps 69:20 Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I waited for sympathy, but there was none; for comforters, but found no one.
19Ps 69:21 Instead, they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
19Ps 69:22 Let their table set before them be a snare, and let it be a trap for [their] allies.
19Ps 69:23 Let their eyes grow too dim to see, and let their loins continually shake.
19Ps 69:24 Pour out Your rage on them, and let Your burning anger overtake them.
19Ps 69:25 Make their fortification desolate; may no one live in their tents.
19Ps 69:26 For they persecute the one You struck and talk about the pain of those You wounded.
19Ps 69:27 Add guilt to their guilt; do not let them share in Your righteousness.
19Ps 69:28 Let them be erased from the book of life and not be recorded with the righteous.
19Ps 69:29 But as for me-- poor and in pain-- let Your salvation protect me, God.
19Ps 69:30 I will praise God's name with song and exalt Him with thanksgiving.
19Ps 69:31 That will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves.
19Ps 69:32 The humble will see it and rejoice. You who seek God, take heart!
19Ps 69:33 For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise His own who are prisoners.
19Ps 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them,
19Ps 69:35 for God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah. They will live there and possess it.
19Ps 69:36 The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will live in it.
19Ps 70:1 [For the choir director. Davidic. To bring remembrance.] God, deliver me. Hurry to help me, LORD!
19Ps 70:2 Let those who seek my life be disgraced and confounded; let those who wish me harm be driven back and humiliated.
19Ps 70:3 Let those who say, "Aha, aha!" retreat because of their shame.
19Ps 70:4 Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; let those who love Your salvation continually say, "God is great!"
19Ps 70:5 I am afflicted and needy; hurry to me, God. You are my help and my deliverer; LORD, do not delay.
19Ps 71:1 LORD, I seek refuge in You; never let me be disgraced.
19Ps 71:2 In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; listen closely to me and save me.
19Ps 71:3 Be a rock of refuge for me, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for You are my rock and fortress.
19Ps 71:4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive.
19Ps 71:5 For You are my hope, Lord God, my confidence from my youth.
19Ps 71:6 I have leaned on You from birth; You took me from my mother's womb. My praise is always about You.
19Ps 71:7 I have become an ominous sign to many, but You are my strong refuge.
19Ps 71:8 My mouth is full of praise and honor to You all day long.
19Ps 71:9 Don't discard me in my old age: as my strength fails, do not abandon me.
19Ps 71:10 For my enemies talk about me, and those who spy on me plot together,
19Ps 71:11 saying, "God has abandoned him; chase him and catch him, for there is no one to rescue [him]."
19Ps 71:12 God, do not be far from me; my God, hurry to help me.
19Ps 71:13 May my adversaries be disgraced and confounded; may those who seek my harm be covered with disgrace and humiliation.
19Ps 71:14 But I will hope continually and will praise You more and more.
19Ps 71:15 My mouth will tell about Your righteousness and Your salvation all day long, though I cannot sum them up.
19Ps 71:16 I come because of the mighty acts of the Lord God; I will proclaim Your righteousness, Yours alone.
19Ps 71:17 God, You have taught me from my youth, and I still proclaim Your wonderful works.
19Ps 71:18 Even when I am old and gray, God, do not abandon me. Then I will proclaim Your power to [another] generation, Your strength to all who are to come.
19Ps 71:19 Your righteousness reaches heaven, God, You who have done great things; God, who is like You?
19Ps 71:20 You caused me to experience many troubles and misfortunes, but You will revive me again. You will bring me up again, even from the depths of the earth.
19Ps 71:21 You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.
19Ps 71:22 Therefore, with a lute I will praise You for Your faithfulness, my God; I will sing to You with a harp, Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 71:23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to You, because You have redeemed me.
19Ps 71:24 Therefore, my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness all day long, for those who seek my harm will be disgraced and confounded.
19Ps 72:1 [Solomonic.] God, give Your justice to the king and Your righteousness to the king's son.
19Ps 72:2 He will judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted ones with justice.
19Ps 72:3 May the mountains bring prosperity to the people, and the hills, righteousness.
19Ps 72:4 May he vindicate the afflicted among the people, help the poor, and crush the oppressor.
19Ps 72:5 May he continue while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
19Ps 72:6 May he be like rain that falls on the cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.
19Ps 72:7 May the righteous flourish in his days, and prosperity abound until the moon is no more.
19Ps 72:8 And may he rule from sea to sea and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
19Ps 72:9 May desert tribes kneel before him and his enemies lick the dust.
19Ps 72:10 May the kings of Tarshish and the coasts and islands bring tribute, the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
19Ps 72:11 And let all kings bow down to him, all nations serve him.
19Ps 72:12 For he will rescue the poor who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.
19Ps 72:13 He will have pity on the poor and helpless and save the lives of the poor.
19Ps 72:14 He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their lives are precious in his sight.
19Ps 72:15 May he live long! May gold from Sheba be given to him. May prayer be offered for him continually, and may he be blessed all day long.
19Ps 72:16 May there be plenty of grain in the land; may it wave on the tops of the mountains. May its crops be like Lebanon. May people flourish in the cities like the grass of the field.
19Ps 72:17 May his name endure forever; as long as the sun shines, may his fame increase. May all nations be blessed by him and call him blessed.
19Ps 72:18 May the LORD God, the God of Israel, be praised, who alone does wonders.
19Ps 72:19 May His glorious name be praised forever; the whole earth is filled with His glory. Amen and amen.
19Ps 72:20 The prayers of David son of Jesse are concluded.
19Ps 73:1 [A psalm of Asaph.] God is indeed good to Israel, to the pure in heart.
19Ps 73:2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my steps nearly went astray.
19Ps 73:3 For I envied the arrogant; I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19Ps 73:4 They have an easy time until they die, and their bodies are well-fed.
19Ps 73:5 They are not in trouble like others; they are not afflicted like most people.
19Ps 73:6 Therefore, pride is their necklace, and violence covers them like a garment.
19Ps 73:7 Their eyes bulge out from fatness; the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
19Ps 73:8 They mock, and they speak maliciously; they arrogantly threaten oppression.
19Ps 73:9 They set their mouths against heaven, and their tongues strut across the earth.
19Ps 73:10 Therefore His people turn to them and drink in their overflowing waters.
19Ps 73:11 They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High know everything?"
19Ps 73:12 Look at them-- the wicked! They are always at ease, and they increase their wealth.
19Ps 73:13 Did I purify my heart and wash my hands in innocence for nothing?
19Ps 73:14 For I am afflicted all day long, and punished every morning.
19Ps 73:15 If I had decided to say these things [aloud], I would have betrayed Your people.
19Ps 73:16 When I tried to understand all this, it seemed hopeless
19Ps 73:17 until I entered God's sanctuary. Then I understood their destiny.
19Ps 73:18 Indeed You put them in slippery places; You make them fall into ruin.
19Ps 73:19 How suddenly they become a desolation! They come to an end, swept away by terrors.
19Ps 73:20 Like one waking from a dream, Lord, when arising, You will despise their image.
19Ps 73:21 When I became embittered and my innermost being was wounded,
19Ps 73:22 I was a fool and didn't understand; I was an unthinking animal toward You.
19Ps 73:23 Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.
19Ps 73:24 You guide me with Your counsel, and afterwards You will take me up in glory.
19Ps 73:25 Whom do I have in heaven but You? And I desire nothing on earth but You.
19Ps 73:26 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart, my portion forever.
19Ps 73:27 Those far from You will certainly perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.
19Ps 73:28 But as for me, God's presence is my good. I have made the Lord God my refuge, so I can tell about all You do.
19Ps 74:1 [A Maskil of Asaph.] Why have You rejected [us] forever, God? Why does Your anger burn against the sheep of Your pasture?
19Ps 74:2 Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe for Your own possession. [Remember] Mount Zion where You dwell.
19Ps 74:3 Make Your way to the everlasting ruins, to all that the enemy has destroyed in the sanctuary.
19Ps 74:4 Your adversaries roared in the meeting place where You met with us. They set up their emblems as signs.
19Ps 74:5 It was like men in a thicket of trees, wielding axes,
19Ps 74:6 then smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.
19Ps 74:7 They set Your sanctuary on fire; they utterly desecrated the dwelling place of Your name.
19Ps 74:8 They said in their hearts, "Let us oppress them relentlessly." They burned down every place throughout the land where God met with us.
19Ps 74:9 We don't see any signs for us. There is no longer a prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.
19Ps 74:10 God, how long will the foe mock? Will the enemy insult Your name forever?
19Ps 74:11 Why do You hold back Your hand? Stretch out Your right hand and destroy [them]!
19Ps 74:12 God my king is from ancient times, performing saving acts on the earth.
19Ps 74:13 You divided the sea with Your strength; You smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters;
19Ps 74:14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.
19Ps 74:15 You opened up springs and streams; You dried up ever-flowing rivers.
19Ps 74:16 The day is Yours, also the night; You established the moon and the sun.
19Ps 74:17 You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made summer and winter.
19Ps 74:18 Remember this: the enemy has mocked the LORD, and a foolish people has insulted Your name.
19Ps 74:19 Do not give the life of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your poor people forever.
19Ps 74:20 Consider the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of violence.
19Ps 74:21 Do not let the oppressed turn away in shame; let the poor and needy praise Your name.
19Ps 74:22 Arise, God, defend Your cause! Remember the insults that fools bring against You all day long.
19Ps 74:23 Do not forget the clamor of Your adversaries, the tumult of Your opponents that goes up constantly.
19Ps 75:1 [For the choir director: "Do Not Destroy." A psalm of Asaph. A song.] We give thanks to You, God; we give thanks to You, for Your name is near. People tell about Your wonderful works.
19Ps 75:2 "When I choose a time, I will judge fairly.
19Ps 75:3 When the earth and all its inhabitants shake, I am the One who steadies its pillars. Selah
19Ps 75:4 I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn.
19Ps 75:5 Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak arrogantly.'"
19Ps 75:6 Exaltation does not come from the east, the west, or the desert,
19Ps 75:7 for God is the judge: He brings down one and exalts another.
19Ps 75:8 For there is a cup in the LORD's hand, full of wine blended with spices, and He pours from it. All the wicked of the earth will drink, draining it to the dregs.
19Ps 75:9 As for me, I will tell about Him forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
19Ps 75:10 "I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up."
19Ps 76:1 [For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song.] God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
19Ps 76:2 His tent is in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion.
19Ps 76:3 There He shatters the bow's flaming arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah
19Ps 76:4 You are resplendent and majestic [coming down] from the mountains of prey.
19Ps 76:5 The brave-hearted have been plundered; they have slipped into their [final] sleep. None of the warriors was able to lift a hand.
19Ps 76:6 At Your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse lay still.
19Ps 76:7 And You-- You are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?
19Ps 76:8 From heaven You pronounced judgment. The earth feared and grew quiet
19Ps 76:9 when God rose up to judge and to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah
19Ps 76:10 Even human wrath will praise You; You will clothe Yourself with their remaining wrath.
19Ps 76:11 Make and keep your vows to the LORD your God; let all who are around Him bring tribute to the awe-inspiring One.
19Ps 76:12 He humbles the spirit of leaders; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
19Ps 77:1 [For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.] I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and He will hear me.
19Ps 77:2 In my day of trouble I sought the Lord. My hands were lifted up all night long; I refused to be comforted.
19Ps 77:3 I think of God; I groan; I meditate; my spirit becomes weak. Selah
19Ps 77:4 You have kept me from closing my eyes; I am troubled and cannot speak.
19Ps 77:5 I consider days of old, years long past.
19Ps 77:6 At night I remember my music; I meditate in my heart, and my spirit ponders.
19Ps 77:7 "Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor?
19Ps 77:8 Has His faithful love ceased forever? Is [His] promise at an end for all generations?
19Ps 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger withheld His compassion?" Selah
19Ps 77:10 So I say, "It is my sorrow that the right hand of the Most High has changed."
19Ps 77:11 I will remember the LORD's works; yes, I will remember Your ancient wonders.
19Ps 77:12 I will reflect on all You have done and meditate on Your actions.
19Ps 77:13 God, Your way is holy. What god is great like God?
19Ps 77:14 You are the God who works wonders; You revealed Your strength among the peoples.
19Ps 77:15 With power You redeemed Your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
19Ps 77:16 The waters saw You, God. The waters saw You; they trembled. Even the depths shook.
19Ps 77:17 The clouds poured down water. The storm clouds thundered; Your arrows flashed back and forth.
19Ps 77:18 The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; lightning lit up the world. The earth shook and quaked.
19Ps 77:19 Your way went through the sea, and Your path through the great waters, but Your footprints were unseen.
19Ps 77:20 You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19Ps 78:1 [A Maskil of Asaph.] My people, hear my instruction; listen to what I say.
19Ps 78:2 I will declare wise sayings; I will speak mysteries from the past--
19Ps 78:3 things we have heard and known and that our fathers have passed down to us.
19Ps 78:4 We must not hide them from their children, but must tell a future generation the praises of the LORD, His might, and the wonderful works He has performed.
19Ps 78:5 He established a testimony in Jacob and set up a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children
19Ps 78:6 so that a future generation-- children yet to be born-- might know. They were to rise and tell their children
19Ps 78:7 so that they might put their confidence in God and not forget God's works, but keep His commandments.
19Ps 78:8 Then they would not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not loyal and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
19Ps 78:9 The Ephraimite archers turned back on the day of battle.
19Ps 78:10 They did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by His law.
19Ps 78:11 They forgot what He had done, the wonderful works He had shown them.
19Ps 78:12 He worked wonders in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, the region of Zoan.
19Ps 78:13 He split the sea and brought them across; the water stood firm like a wall.
19Ps 78:14 He led them with a cloud by day and with a fiery light throughout the night.
19Ps 78:15 He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the depths.
19Ps 78:16 He brought streams out of the stone and made water flow down like rivers.
19Ps 78:17 But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
19Ps 78:18 They deliberately tested God, demanding the food they craved.
19Ps 78:19 They spoke against God, saying, "Is God able to provide food in the wilderness?
19Ps 78:20 Look! He struck the rock and water gushed out; torrents overflowed. But can He also provide bread or furnish meat for His people?"
19Ps 78:21 Therefore, the LORD heard and became furious; then fire broke out against Jacob, and anger flared up against Israel
19Ps 78:22 because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.
19Ps 78:23 He gave a command to the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.
19Ps 78:24 He rained manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.
19Ps 78:25 People ate the bread of angels. He sent them an abundant supply of food.
19Ps 78:26 He made the east wind blow in the skies and drove the south wind by His might.
19Ps 78:27 He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas.
19Ps 78:28 He made [them] fall in His camp, all around His tent.
19Ps 78:29 They ate and were completely satisfied, for He gave them what they craved.
19Ps 78:30 Before they had satisfied their desire, while the food was still in their mouths,
19Ps 78:31 God's anger flared up against them, and He killed some of their best men. He struck down Israel's choice young men.
19Ps 78:32 Despite all this, they kept sinning and did not believe His wonderful works.
19Ps 78:33 He made their days end in futility, their years in sudden disaster.
19Ps 78:34 When He killed [some of] them, [the rest] began to seek Him; they repented and searched for God.
19Ps 78:35 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their Redeemer.
19Ps 78:36 But they deceived Him with their mouths, they lied to Him with their tongues,
19Ps 78:37 their hearts were insincere toward Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
19Ps 78:38 Yet He was compassionate; He atoned for [their] guilt and did not destroy [them]. He often turned His anger aside and did not unleash all His wrath.
19Ps 78:39 He remembered that they were [only] flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.
19Ps 78:40 How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert.
19Ps 78:41 They constantly tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 78:42 They did not remember His power [shown] on the day He redeemed them from the foe,
19Ps 78:43 when He performed His miraculous signs in Egypt and His marvels in the region of Zoan.
19Ps 78:44 He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams.
19Ps 78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which fed on them, and frogs, which devastated them.
19Ps 78:46 He gave their crops to the caterpillar and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
19Ps 78:47 He killed their vines with hail and their sycamore-fig trees with a flood.
19Ps 78:48 He handed over their livestock to hail and their cattle to lightning bolts.
19Ps 78:49 He sent His burning anger against them: fury, indignation, and calamity-- a band of deadly messengers.
19Ps 78:50 He cleared a path for His anger. He did not spare them from death, but delivered their lives to the plague.
19Ps 78:51 He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first progeny of the tents of Ham.
19Ps 78:52 He led His people out like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
19Ps 78:53 He led them safely, and they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies.
19Ps 78:54 He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand acquired.
19Ps 78:55 He drove out nations before them. He apportioned their inheritance by lot and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
19Ps 78:56 But they rebelliously tested the Most High God, for they did not keep His decrees.
19Ps 78:57 They treacherously turned away like their fathers; they became warped like a faulty bow.
19Ps 78:58 They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their carved images.
19Ps 78:59 God heard and became furious; He completely rejected Israel.
19Ps 78:60 He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where He resided among men.
19Ps 78:61 He gave up His strength to captivity and His splendor to the hand of a foe.
19Ps 78:62 He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged with His heritage.
19Ps 78:63 Fire consumed His chosen young men, and His young women had no wedding songs.
19Ps 78:64 His priests fell by the sword, but the widows could not lament.
19Ps 78:65 Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior from the effects of wine.
19Ps 78:66 He beat back His foes; He gave them lasting shame.
19Ps 78:67 He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
19Ps 78:68 He chose instead the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
19Ps 78:69 He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that He established forever.
19Ps 78:70 He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
19Ps 78:71 He brought him from tending ewes to be shepherd over His people Jacob-- over Israel, His inheritance.
19Ps 78:72 He shepherded them with a pure heart and guided them with his skillful hands.
19Ps 79:1 [A psalm of Asaph.] God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, desecrated Your holy temple, and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
19Ps 79:2 They gave the corpses of Your servants to the birds of the sky for food, the flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
19Ps 79:3 They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury [them].
19Ps 79:4 We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.
19Ps 79:5 How long, LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy keep burning like fire?
19Ps 79:6 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don't acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that don't call on Your name,
19Ps 79:7 for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
19Ps 79:8 Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come to us quickly, for we have become weak.
19Ps 79:9 God of our salvation, help us-- for the glory of Your name. Deliver us and atone for our sins, because of Your name.
19Ps 79:10 Why should the nations ask, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, let vengeance for the shed blood of Your servants be known among the nations.
19Ps 79:11 Let the groans of the prisoners reach You; according to Your great power, preserve those condemned to die.
19Ps 79:12 Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors the reproach they have hurled at You, Lord.
19Ps 79:13 Then we, Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; we will declare Your praise to generation after generation.
19Ps 80:1 [For the choir director: according to "The Lilies." A testimony of Asaph. A psalm.] Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who guides Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned [on] the cherubim, rise up
19Ps 80:2 at the head of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your power and come to save us.
19Ps 80:3 Restore us, God; look [on us] with favor, and we will be saved.
19Ps 80:4 LORD God of Hosts, how long will You be angry with Your people's prayers?
19Ps 80:5 You fed them the bread of tears and gave them a full measure of tears to drink.
19Ps 80:6 You set us at strife with our neighbors; our enemies make fun of us.
19Ps 80:7 Restore us, God of Hosts; look [on us] with favor, and we will be saved.
19Ps 80:8 You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it.
19Ps 80:9 You cleared [a place] for it; it took root and filled the land.
19Ps 80:10 The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.
19Ps 80:11 It sent out sprouts toward the Sea and shoots toward the River.
19Ps 80:12 Why have You broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
19Ps 80:13 The boar from the forest gnaws at it, and creatures of the field feed on it.
19Ps 80:14 Return, God of Hosts. Look down from heaven and see; take care of this vine,
19Ps 80:15 the root Your right hand has planted, the shoot that You made strong for Yourself.
19Ps 80:16 It was cut down and burned up; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
19Ps 80:17 Let Your hand be with the man at Your right hand, with the son of man You have made strong for Yourself.
19Ps 80:18 Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.
19Ps 80:19 Restore us, LORD God of Hosts; look [on us] with favor, and we will be saved.
19Ps 81:1 [For the choir director: on the Gittith. Of Asaph.] Sing for joy to God our strength; shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.
19Ps 81:2 Lift up a song-- play the tambourine, the melodious lyre, and the harp.
19Ps 81:3 Blow the horn during the new moon and during the full moon, on the day of our feast.
19Ps 81:4 For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob.
19Ps 81:5 He set it up as an ordinance for Joseph when He went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard an unfamiliar language:
19Ps 81:6 "I relieved his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from [carrying] the basket.
19Ps 81:7 You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the thundercloud. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
19Ps 81:8 Listen, My people, and I will admonish you. Israel, if you would only listen to Me!
19Ps 81:9 There must not be a strange god among you; you must not bow down to a foreign god.
19Ps 81:10 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
19Ps 81:11 "But My people did not listen to Me; Israel did not obey Me.
19Ps 81:12 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own plans.
19Ps 81:13 If only My people would listen to Me and Israel would follow My ways,
19Ps 81:14 I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes."
19Ps 81:15 Those who hate the LORD would pretend submission to Him; their doom would last forever.
19Ps 81:16 But He would feed Israel with the best wheat. "I would satisfy you with honey from the rock."
19Ps 82:1 [A psalm of Asaph.] God has taken His place in the divine assembly; He judges among the gods:
19Ps 82:2 "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
19Ps 82:3 Provide justice for the needy and the fatherless; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.
19Ps 82:4 Rescue the poor and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked."
19Ps 82:5 They do not know or understand; they wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
19Ps 82:6 I said, "You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.
19Ps 82:7 However, you will die like men and fall like any other ruler."
19Ps 82:8 Rise up, God, judge the earth, for all the nations belong to You.
19Ps 83:1 [A song. A psalm of Asaph.] God, do not keep silent. Do not be deaf, God; do not be idle.
19Ps 83:2 See how Your enemies make an uproar; those who hate You have acted arrogantly.
19Ps 83:3 They devise clever schemes against Your people; they conspire against Your treasured ones.
19Ps 83:4 They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation so that Israel's name will no longer be remembered."
19Ps 83:5 For they have conspired with one mind; they form an alliance against You--
19Ps 83:6 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
19Ps 83:7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
19Ps 83:8 Even Assyria has joined them; they lend support to the sons of Lot. Selah
19Ps 83:9 Deal with them as [You did] with Midian, as [You did] with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
19Ps 83:10 They were destroyed at En-dor; they became manure for the ground.
19Ps 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
19Ps 83:12 who said, "Let us seize God's pastures for ourselves."
19Ps 83:13 Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like straw before the wind.
19Ps 83:14 As fire burns a forest, as a flame blazes through mountains,
19Ps 83:15 so pursue them with Your tempest and terrify them with Your storm.
19Ps 83:16 Cover their faces with shame so that they will seek Your name, LORD.
19Ps 83:17 Let them be put to shame and terrified forever; let them perish in disgrace.
19Ps 83:18 May they know that You alone-- whose name is Yahweh-- are the Most High over all the earth.
19Ps 84:1 [For the choir director: on the Gittith. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] How lovely is Your dwelling place, LORD of Hosts.
19Ps 84:2 I long and yearn for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God.
19Ps 84:3 Even a sparrow finds a home, and a swallow, a nest for herself where she places her young-- near Your altars, LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.
19Ps 84:4 How happy are those who reside in Your house, who praise You continually. Selah
19Ps 84:5 Happy are the people whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
19Ps 84:6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a source of springwater; even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings.
19Ps 84:7 They go from strength to strength; each appears before God in Zion.
19Ps 84:8 LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob. Selah
19Ps 84:9 Consider our shield, God; look on the face of Your anointed one.
19Ps 84:10 Better a day in Your courts than a thousand [anywhere else]. I would rather be at the door of the house of my God than to live in the tents of the wicked.
19Ps 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield. The LORD gives grace and glory; He does not withhold the good from those who live with integrity.
19Ps 84:12 LORD of Hosts, happy is the person who trusts in You!
19Ps 85:1 [For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.] LORD, You showed favor to Your land; You restored Jacob's prosperity.
19Ps 85:2 You took away Your people's guilt; You covered all their sin. Selah
19Ps 85:3 You withdrew all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.
19Ps 85:4 Return to us, God of our salvation, and abandon Your displeasure with us.
19Ps 85:5 Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger for all generations?
19Ps 85:6 Will You not revive us again so that Your people may rejoice in You?
19Ps 85:7 Show us Your faithful love, LORD, and give us Your salvation.
19Ps 85:8 I will listen to what God will say; surely the LORD will declare peace to His people, His godly ones, and not let them go back to foolish ways.
19Ps 85:9 His salvation is very near those who fear Him, so that glory may dwell in our land.
19Ps 85:10 Faithful love and truth will join together; righteousness and peace will embrace.
19Ps 85:11 Truth will spring up from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven.
19Ps 85:12 Also, the LORD will provide what is good, and our land will yield its crops.
19Ps 85:13 Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
19Ps 86:1 [A Davidic prayer.] Listen, LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
19Ps 86:2 Protect my life, for I am faithful. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.
19Ps 86:3 Be gracious to me, Lord, for I call to You all day long.
19Ps 86:4 Bring joy to Your servant's life, since I set my hope on You, Lord.
19Ps 86:5 For You, Lord, are kind and ready to forgive, abundant in faithful love to all who call on You.
19Ps 86:6 LORD, hear my prayer; listen to my plea for mercy.
19Ps 86:7 I call on You in the day of my distress, for You will answer me.
19Ps 86:8 Lord, there is no one like You among the gods, and there are no works like Yours.
19Ps 86:9 All the nations You have made will come and bow down before You, Lord, and will honor Your name.
19Ps 86:10 For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.
19Ps 86:11 Teach me Your way, LORD, and I will live by Your truth. Give me an undivided mind to fear Your name.
19Ps 86:12 I will praise You with all my heart, Lord my God, and will honor Your name forever.
19Ps 86:13 For Your faithful love for me is great, and You deliver my life from the depths of Sheol.
19Ps 86:14 God, arrogant people have attacked me; a gang of ruthless men seeks my life. They have no regard for You.
19Ps 86:15 But You, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abundant in faithful love and truth.
19Ps 86:16 Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your female servant.
19Ps 86:17 Show me a sign of Your goodness; my enemies will see and be put to shame because You, LORD, have helped and comforted me.
19Ps 87:1 [A psalm of the sons of Korah. A song.] His foundation is on the holy mountains.
19Ps 87:2 The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
19Ps 87:3 Glorious things are said about you, city of God. Selah
19Ps 87:4 "I will mention those who know Me: Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush-- each one was born there."
19Ps 87:5 And it will be said of Zion, "This one and that one were born in her." The Most High Himself will establish her.
19Ps 87:6 When He registers the peoples, the LORD will record, "This one was born there." Selah
19Ps 87:7 Singers and dancers alike [will say], "All my springs are in you."
19Ps 88:1 [A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.] LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out before You day and night.
19Ps 88:2 May my prayer reach Your presence; listen to my cry.
19Ps 88:3 For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol.
19Ps 88:4 I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength,
19Ps 88:5 abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom You no longer remember, and who are cut off from Your care.
19Ps 88:6 You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths.
19Ps 88:7 Your wrath weighs heavily on me; You have overwhelmed me with all Your waves. Selah
19Ps 88:8 You have distanced my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out.
19Ps 88:9 My eyes are worn out from crying. LORD, I cry out to You all day long; I spread out my hands to You.
19Ps 88:10 Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah
19Ps 88:11 Will Your faithful love be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
19Ps 88:12 Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
19Ps 88:13 But I call to You for help, LORD; in the morning my prayer meets You.
19Ps 88:14 LORD, why do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?
19Ps 88:15 From my youth, I have been afflicted and near death. I suffer Your horrors; I am desperate.
19Ps 88:16 Your wrath sweeps over me; Your terrors destroy me.
19Ps 88:17 They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side.
19Ps 88:18 You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my [only] friend.
19Ps 89:1 [A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.] I will sing about the LORD's faithful love forever; with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations.
19Ps 89:2 For I will declare, "Faithful love is built up forever; You establish Your faithfulness in the heavens."
19Ps 89:3 [The LORD said,] "I have made a covenant with My chosen one; I have sworn an oath to David My servant:
19Ps 89:4 'I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.' " Selah
19Ps 89:5 LORD, the heavens praise Your wonders-- Your faithfulness also-- in the assembly of the holy ones.
19Ps 89:6 For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?
19Ps 89:7 God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, more awe-inspiring than all who surround Him.
19Ps 89:8 LORD God of Hosts, who is strong like You, LORD? Your faithfulness surrounds You.
19Ps 89:9 You rule the raging sea; when its waves surge, You still them.
19Ps 89:10 You crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your powerful arm.
19Ps 89:11 The heavens are Yours; the earth also is Yours. The world and everything in it-- You founded them.
19Ps 89:12 North and south-- You created them. Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
19Ps 89:13 You have a mighty arm; Your hand is powerful; Your right hand is lifted high.
19Ps 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; faithful love and truth go before You.
19Ps 89:15 Happy are the people who know the joyful shout; LORD, they walk in the light of Your presence.
19Ps 89:16 They rejoice in Your name all day long, and they are exalted by Your righteousness.
19Ps 89:17 For You are their magnificent strength; by Your favor our horn is exalted.
19Ps 89:18 Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 89:19 You once spoke in a vision to Your loyal ones and said: "I have granted help to a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
19Ps 89:20 I have found David My servant; I have anointed him with My sacred oil.
19Ps 89:21 My hand will always be with him, and My arm will strengthen him.
19Ps 89:22 The enemy will not afflict him; no wicked man will oppress him.
19Ps 89:23 I will crush his foes before him and strike those who hate him.
19Ps 89:24 My faithfulness and love will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted.
19Ps 89:25 I will extend his power to the sea and his right hand to the rivers.
19Ps 89:26 He will call to Me, 'You are my Father, my God, the rock of my salvation.'
19Ps 89:27 I will also make him My firstborn, greatest of the kings of the earth.
19Ps 89:28 I will always preserve My faithful love for him, and My covenant with him will endure.
19Ps 89:29 I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as heaven lasts.
19Ps 89:30 If his sons forsake My instruction and do not live by My ordinances,
19Ps 89:31 if they dishonor My statutes and do not keep My commandments,
19Ps 89:32 then I will call their rebellion to account with the rod, their sin with blows.
19Ps 89:33 But I will not withdraw My faithful love from him or betray My faithfulness.
19Ps 89:34 I will not violate My covenant or change what My lips have said.
19Ps 89:35 Once and for all I have sworn an oath by My holiness; I will not lie to David.
19Ps 89:36 His offspring will continue forever, his throne like the sun before Me,
19Ps 89:37 like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky." Selah
19Ps 89:38 But You have spurned and rejected him; You have become enraged with Your anointed.
19Ps 89:39 You have repudiated the covenant with Your servant; You have completely dishonored his crown.
19Ps 89:40 You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his fortified cities to ruins.
19Ps 89:41 All who pass by plunder him; he has become a joke to his neighbors.
19Ps 89:42 You have lifted high the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice.
19Ps 89:43 You have also turned back his sharp sword and have not let him stand in battle.
19Ps 89:44 You have made his splendor cease and have overturned his throne.
19Ps 89:45 You have shortened the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah
19Ps 89:46 How long, LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your anger keep burning like fire?
19Ps 89:47 Remember how short my life is. Have You created everyone for nothing?
19Ps 89:48 What man can live and never see death? Who can save himself from the power of Sheol? Selah
19Ps 89:49 Lord, where are the former acts of Your faithful love that You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
19Ps 89:50 Remember, Lord, the ridicule against Your servants-- in my heart I carry [abuse] from all the peoples--
19Ps 89:51 how Your enemies have ridiculed, LORD, how they have ridiculed every step of Your anointed.
19Ps 89:52 May the LORD be praised forever. Amen and amen.
19Ps 90:1 [A prayer of Moses the man of God.] Lord, You have been our refuge in every generation.
19Ps 90:2 Before the mountains were born, before You gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, You are God.
19Ps 90:3 You return mankind to the dust, saying, "Return, descendants of Adam."
19Ps 90:4 For in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that passes by, like a few hours of the night.
19Ps 90:5 You end their life; they sleep. They are like grass that grows in the morning--
19Ps 90:6 in the morning it sprouts and grows; by evening it withers and dries up.
19Ps 90:7 For we are consumed by Your anger; we are terrified by Your wrath.
19Ps 90:8 You have set our unjust ways before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.
19Ps 90:9 For all our days ebb away under Your wrath; we end our years like a sigh.
19Ps 90:10 Our lives last seventy years or, if we are strong, eighty years. Even the best of them are struggle and sorrow; indeed, they pass quickly and we fly away.
19Ps 90:11 Who understands the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear that is due You.
19Ps 90:12 Teach us to number our days carefully so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts.
19Ps 90:13 Lord-- how long? Turn and have compassion on Your servants.
19Ps 90:14 Satisfy us in the morning with Your faithful love so that we may shout with joy and be glad all our days.
19Ps 90:15 Make us rejoice for as many days as You have humbled us, for as many years as we have seen adversity.
19Ps 90:16 Let Your work be seen by Your servants, and Your splendor by their children.
19Ps 90:17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish for us the work of our hands-- establish the work of our hands!
19Ps 91:1 The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty.
19Ps 91:2 I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust."
19Ps 91:3 He Himself will deliver you from the hunter's net, from the destructive plague.
19Ps 91:4 He will cover you with His feathers; you will take refuge under His wings. His faithfulness will be a protective shield.
19Ps 91:5 You will not fear the terror of the night, the arrow that flies by day,
19Ps 91:6 the plague that stalks in darkness, or the pestilence that ravages at noon.
19Ps 91:7 Though a thousand fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, the pestilence will not reach you.
19Ps 91:8 You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.
19Ps 91:9 Because you have made the Lord-- my refuge, the Most High-- your dwelling place,
19Ps 91:10 no harm will come to you; no plague will come near your tent.
19Ps 91:11 For He will give His angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways.
19Ps 91:12 They will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
19Ps 91:13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the young lion and the serpent.
19Ps 91:14 Because he is lovingly devoted to Me, I will deliver him; I will exalt him because he knows My name.
19Ps 91:15 When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will rescue him and give him honor.
19Ps 91:16 I will satisfy him with a long life and show him My salvation.
19Ps 92:1 [A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.] It is good to praise the LORD, to sing praise to Your name, Most High,
19Ps 92:2 to declare Your faithful love in the morning and Your faithfulness at night,
19Ps 92:3 with a ten-stringed harp and the music of a lyre.
19Ps 92:4 For You have made me rejoice, LORD, by what You have done; I will shout for joy because of the works of Your hands.
19Ps 92:5 How magnificent are Your works, LORD, how profound Your thoughts!
19Ps 92:6 A stupid person does not know, a fool does not understand this:
19Ps 92:7 though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be eternally destroyed.
19Ps 92:8 But You, LORD, are exalted forever.
19Ps 92:9 For indeed, LORD, Your enemies-- indeed, Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
19Ps 92:10 You have lifted up my horn like that of a wild ox; I have been anointed with oil.
19Ps 92:11 My eyes look down on my enemies; my ears hear evildoers when they attack me.
19Ps 92:12 The righteous thrive like a palm tree and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon.
19Ps 92:13 Planted in the house of the LORD, they thrive in the courtyards of our God.
19Ps 92:14 They will still bear fruit in old age, healthy and green,
19Ps 92:15 to declare: "The LORD is just; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him."
19Ps 93:1 The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; The LORD is robed, enveloped in strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.
19Ps 93:2 Your throne has been established from the beginning; You are from eternity.
19Ps 93:3 The floods have lifted up, LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves.
19Ps 93:4 Greater than the roar of many waters-- the mighty breakers of the sea-- the LORD on high is majestic.
19Ps 93:5 LORD, Your testimonies are completely reliable; holiness is the beauty of Your house for all the days to come.
19Ps 94:1 LORD, God of vengeance-- God of vengeance, appear.
19Ps 94:2 Rise up, Judge of the earth; repay the proud what they deserve.
19Ps 94:3 LORD, how long will the wicked-- how long will the wicked gloat?
19Ps 94:4 They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
19Ps 94:5 LORD, they crush Your people; they afflict Your heritage.
19Ps 94:6 They kill the widow and the foreigner and murder the fatherless.
19Ps 94:7 They say, "The LORD doesn't see it. The God of Jacob doesn't pay attention."
19Ps 94:8 Pay attention, you stupid people! Fools, when will you be wise?
19Ps 94:9 Can the One who shaped the ear not hear, the One who formed the eye not see?
19Ps 94:10 The One who instructs nations, the One who teaches man knowledge-- does He not discipline?
19Ps 94:11 The LORD knows man's thoughts; they are meaningless.
19Ps 94:12 LORD, happy is the man You discipline and teach from Your law
19Ps 94:13 to give him relief from troubled times until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19Ps 94:14 The LORD will not forsake His people or abandon His heritage,
19Ps 94:15 for justice will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19Ps 94:16 Who stands up for me against the wicked? Who takes a stand for me against evildoers?
19Ps 94:17 If the LORD had not been my help, I would soon rest in the silence [of death].
19Ps 94:18 If I say, "My foot is slipping," Your faithful love will support me, LORD.
19Ps 94:19 When I am filled with cares, Your comfort brings me joy.
19Ps 94:20 Can a corrupt throne-- one that creates trouble by law-- become Your ally?

19Ps 95:9 where your fathers tested Me; they tried Me, though they had seen what I did.
19Ps 95:10 For 40 years I was disgusted with that generation; I said, 'They are a people whose hearts go astray; they do not know My ways.'

19Ps 102:20 to hear a prisoner's groaning, to set free those condemned to die,
19Ps 102:21 so that they might declare the name of the LORD in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem,
19Ps 102:22 when peoples and kingdoms are assembled to serve the LORD.

19Ps 102:26 They will perish, but You will endure; all of them will wear out like clothing. You will change them like a garment, and they will pass away.
19Ps 102:27 But You are the same, and Your years will never end.
19Ps 102:28 Your servants' children will dwell [securely], and their offspring will be established before You."

19Ps 103:2 My soul, praise the LORD, and do not forget all His benefits.

19Ps 103:6 The LORD executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
19Ps 103:7 He revealed His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.
19Ps 103:8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and full of faithful love.
19Ps 103:9 He will not always accuse [us] or be angry forever.
19Ps 103:10 He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our offenses.
19Ps 103:11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His faithful love toward those who fear Him.
19Ps 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
19Ps 103:13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
19Ps 103:14 For He knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust.
19Ps 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass-- he blooms like a flower of the field;

19Ps 103:18 of those who keep His covenant, who remember to observe His instructions.
19Ps 103:19 The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.
19Ps 103:20 Praise the LORD, [all] His angels of great strength, who do His word, obedient to His command.
19Ps 103:21 Praise the LORD, all His armies, His servants who do His will.
19Ps 103:22 Praise the LORD, all His works in all the places where He rules. My soul, praise the LORD!
19Ps 104:1 My soul, praise the LORD! LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with majesty and splendor.
19Ps 104:2 He wraps Himself in light as if it were a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy,
19Ps 104:3 laying the beams of His palace on the waters [above], making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind,
19Ps 104:4 and making the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.
19Ps 104:5 He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken.
19Ps 104:6 You covered it with the deep as if it were a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19Ps 104:7 At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away--
19Ps 104:8 mountains rose and valleys sank-- to the place You established for them.
19Ps 104:9 You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never cover the earth again.
19Ps 104:10 He causes the springs to gush into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.
19Ps 104:11 They supply water for every wild beast; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19Ps 104:12 The birds of the sky live beside [the springs]; they sing among the foliage.
19Ps 104:13 He waters the mountains from His palace; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of Your labor.
19Ps 104:14 He causes grass to grow for the livestock and [provides] crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth,
19Ps 104:15 wine that makes man's heart glad-- making his face shine with oil-- and bread that sustains man's heart.
19Ps 104:16 The trees of the LORD flourish, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.
19Ps 104:17 There the birds make their nests; the stork makes its home in the pine trees.
19Ps 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.
19Ps 104:19 He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.
19Ps 104:20 You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals stir.
19Ps 104:21 The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
19Ps 104:22 The sun rises; they go back and lie down in their dens.
19Ps 104:23 Man goes out to his work and to his labor until evening.
19Ps 104:24 How countless are Your works, LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.
19Ps 104:25 Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number-- living things both large and small.
19Ps 104:26 There the ships move about, and Leviathan, which You formed to play there.
19Ps 104:27 All of them wait for You to give them their food at the right time.
19Ps 104:28 When You give it to them, they gather it; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
19Ps 104:29 When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
19Ps 104:30 When You send Your breath, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.
19Ps 104:31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.
19Ps 104:32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke.
19Ps 104:33 I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live.
19Ps 104:34 May my meditation be pleasing to Him; I will rejoice in the LORD.
19Ps 104:35 May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. My soul, praise the LORD! Hallelujah!
19Ps 105:1 Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name; proclaim His deeds among the peoples.
19Ps 105:2 Sing to Him, sing praise to Him; tell about all His wonderful works!
19Ps 105:3 Honor His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
19Ps 105:4 Search for the LORD and for His strength; seek His face always.
19Ps 105:5 Remember the wonderful works He has done, His wonders, and the judgments He has pronounced,
19Ps 105:6 You offspring of Abraham His servant, Jacob's descendants-- His chosen ones.
19Ps 105:7 He is the LORD our God; His judgments [govern] the whole earth.
19Ps 105:8 He forever remembers His covenant, the promise He ordained for a thousand generations--
19Ps 105:9 [the covenant] He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac,
19Ps 105:10 and confirmed to Jacob as a decree and to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
19Ps 105:11 "I will give the land of Canaan to you as your inherited portion."
19Ps 105:12 When they were few in number, very few indeed, and temporary residents in Canaan,
19Ps 105:13 wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another,
19Ps 105:14 He allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
19Ps 105:15 "Do not touch My anointed ones, or harm My prophets."
19Ps 105:16 He called down famine against the land and destroyed the entire food supply.
19Ps 105:17 He had sent a man ahead of them-- Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19Ps 105:18 They hurt his feet with shackles; his neck was put in an iron collar.
19Ps 105:19 Until the time his prediction came true, the word of the LORD tested him.
19Ps 105:20 The king sent [for him] and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.
19Ps 105:21 He made him master of his household, ruler over all his possessions--
19Ps 105:22 binding his officials at will and instructing his elders.
19Ps 105:23 Then Israel went to Egypt; Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:24 The LORD made His people very fruitful; He made them more numerous than their foes,
19Ps 105:25 whose hearts He turned to hate His people and to deal deceptively with His servants.
19Ps 105:26 He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
19Ps 105:27 They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:28 He sent darkness, and it became dark-- for did they not defy His commands?
19Ps 105:29 He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
19Ps 105:30 Their land was overrun with frogs, even in their kings' chambers.
19Ps 105:31 He spoke, and insects came-- gnats throughout their country.
19Ps 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and lightning throughout their land.
19Ps 105:33 He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their territory.
19Ps 105:34 He spoke and locusts came-- young locusts without number.
19Ps 105:35 They devoured all the vegetation in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.
19Ps 105:36 He struck all the firstborn in their land, all their first progeny.
19Ps 105:37 Then He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and no one among His tribes stumbled.
19Ps 105:38 Egypt was glad when they left, for dread of Israel had fallen on them.
19Ps 105:39 He spread a cloud as a covering and [gave] a fire to light up the night.
19Ps 105:40 They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
19Ps 105:41 He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a stream in the desert.
19Ps 105:42 For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.
19Ps 105:43 He brought His people out with rejoicing, His chosen ones with shouts of joy.
19Ps 105:44 He gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited what other peoples had worked for.
19Ps 105:45 [All this happened] so that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!
19Ps 106:1 Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
19Ps 106:2 Who can declare the LORD's mighty acts or proclaim all the praise due Him?
19Ps 106:3 How happy are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, LORD, when You show favor to Your people. Come to me with Your salvation
19Ps 106:5 so that I may enjoy the prosperity of Your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of Your nation, and boast about Your heritage.
19Ps 106:6 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have gone astray and have acted wickedly.
19Ps 106:7 Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp [the significance of] Your wonderful works or remember Your many acts of faithful love; instead, they rebelled by the sea-- the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:8 Yet He saved them because of His name, to make His power known.
19Ps 106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.
19Ps 106:10 He saved them from the hand of the adversary; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
19Ps 106:11 Water covered their foes; not one of them remained.
19Ps 106:12 Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.
19Ps 106:13 They soon forgot His works and would not wait for His counsel.
19Ps 106:14 They were seized with craving in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.
19Ps 106:15 He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.
19Ps 106:16 In the camp they were envious of Moses and of Aaron, the LORD's holy one.
19Ps 106:17 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.
19Ps 106:18 Fire blazed throughout their assembly; flames consumed the wicked.
19Ps 106:19 At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped the cast metal image.
19Ps 106:20 They exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating ox.
19Ps 106:21 They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,
19Ps 106:22 wonderful works in the land of Ham, awe-inspiring deeds at the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:23 So He said He would have destroyed them-- if Moses His chosen one had not stood before Him in the breach to turn His wrath away from destroying [them].
19Ps 106:24 They despised the pleasant land and did not believe His promise.
19Ps 106:25 They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the LORD's voice.
19Ps 106:26 So He raised His hand against them [with an oath] that He would make them fall in the desert
19Ps 106:27 and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them throughout the lands.
19Ps 106:28 They aligned themselves with Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
19Ps 106:29 They provoked the LORD with their deeds, and a plague broke out against them.
19Ps 106:30 But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stopped.
19Ps 106:31 It was credited to him as righteousness throughout all generations to come.
19Ps 106:32 They angered [the LORD] at the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them;
19Ps 106:33 for they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
19Ps 106:34 They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
19Ps 106:35 but mingled with the nations and adopted their ways.
19Ps 106:36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
19Ps 106:37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
19Ps 106:38 They shed innocent blood-- the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; so the land became polluted with blood.
19Ps 106:39 They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
19Ps 106:40 Therefore the LORD's anger burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.
19Ps 106:41 He handed them over to the nations; those who hated them ruled them.
19Ps 106:42 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their power.
19Ps 106:43 He rescued them many times, but they continued to rebel deliberately and were beaten down by their sin.
19Ps 106:44 When He heard their cry, He took note of their distress,
19Ps 106:45 remembered His covenant with them, and relented according to the abundance of His faithful love.
19Ps 106:46 He caused them to be pitied before all their captors.
19Ps 106:47 Save us, LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, so that we may give thanks to Your holy name and rejoice in Your praise.
19Ps 106:48 May the LORD, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, "Amen!" Hallelujah!
19Ps 107:1 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
19Ps 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD proclaim that He has redeemed them from the hand of the foe
19Ps 107:3 and has gathered them from the lands-- from the east and the west, from the north and the south.
19Ps 107:4 Some wandered in the desolate wilderness, finding no way to a city where they could live.
19Ps 107:5 They were hungry and thirsty; their spirits failed within them.
19Ps 107:6 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He rescued them from their distress.
19Ps 107:7 He led them by the right path to go to a city where they could live.
19Ps 107:8 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His faithful love and His wonderful works for the human race.
19Ps 107:9 For He has satisfied the thirsty and filled the hungry with good things.
19Ps 107:10 Others sat in darkness and gloom-- prisoners in cruel chains--
19Ps 107:11 because they rebelled against God's commands and despised the counsel of the Most High.
19Ps 107:12 He broke their spirits with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
19Ps 107:13 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them from their distress.
19Ps 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their chains apart.
19Ps 107:15 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His faithful love and His wonderful works for the human race.
19Ps 107:16 For He has broken down the bronze gates and cut through the iron bars.
19Ps 107:17 Fools suffered affliction because of their rebellious ways and their sins.
19Ps 107:18 They loathed all food and came near the gates of death.
19Ps 107:19 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them from their distress.

19Ps 120:2 "LORD, deliver me from lying lips and a deceitful tongue."
19Ps 120:3 What will He give you, and what will He do to you, you deceitful tongue?
19Ps 120:4 A warrior's sharp arrows, with burning charcoal!
19Ps 120:5 What misery that I have stayed in Meshech, that I have lived among the tents of Kedar!
19Ps 120:6 I have lived too long with those who hate peace.
19Ps 120:7 I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
19Ps 121:1 [A song of ascents.] I raise my eyes toward the mountains. Where will my help come from?
19Ps 121:2 My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19Ps 121:3 He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber.

19Ps 121:8 The LORD will protect your coming and going both now and forever.
19Ps 122:1 [A Davidic song of ascents.] I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."
19Ps 122:2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem--
19Ps 122:3 Jerusalem, built as a city [should be], solidly joined together,
19Ps 122:4 where the tribes, the tribes of the LORD, go up to give thanks to the name of the LORD. (This is an ordinance for Israel.)
19Ps 122:5 There, thrones for judgment are placed, thrones of the house of David.
19Ps 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May those who love you prosper;
19Ps 122:7 may there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your fortresses."
19Ps 122:8 Because of my brothers and friends, I will say, "Peace be with you."
19Ps 122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good.
19Ps 123:1 [A song of ascents.] I lift my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven.
19Ps 123:2 Like a servant's eyes on His master's hand, like a servant girl's eyes on her mistress's hand, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us favor.
19Ps 123:3 Show us favor, LORD, show us favor, for we've had more than enough contempt.
19Ps 123:4 We've had more than enough scorn from the arrogant [and] contempt from the proud.
19Ps 124:1 [A Davidic song of ascents.] If the LORD had not been on our side-- let Israel say--
19Ps 124:2 If the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,
19Ps 124:3 then they would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger against us.
19Ps 124:4 Then the waters would have engulfed us; the torrent would have swept over us;
19Ps 124:5 the raging waters would have swept over us.
19Ps 124:6 Praise the LORD, who has not let us be ripped apart by their teeth.
19Ps 124:7 We have escaped like a bird from the hunter's net; the net is torn, and we have escaped.
19Ps 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
19Ps 125:1 [A song of ascents.] Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be shaken; it remains forever.
19Ps 125:2 Jerusalem-- the mountains surround her. And the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forever.

19Ps 126:1 [A song of ascents.] When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
19Ps 126:2 Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."
19Ps 126:3 The LORD had done great things for us; we were joyful.
19Ps 126:4 Restore our fortunes, LORD, like watercourses in the Negev.
19Ps 126:5 Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
19Ps 126:6 Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves.
19Ps 127:1 [A Solomonic song of ascents.] Unless the LORD builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the LORD watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain.
19Ps 127:2 In vain you get up early and stay up late, eating food earned by hard work; certainly He gives sleep to the one He loves.
19Ps 127:3 Sons are indeed a heritage from the LORD, children, a reward.
19Ps 127:4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one's youth.
19Ps 127:5 Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them. Such men will never be put to shame when they speak with [their] enemies at the city gate.
19Ps 128:1 [A song of ascents.] How happy is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in His ways!
19Ps 128:2 You will surely eat what your hands have worked for. You will be happy, and it will go well for you.
19Ps 128:3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house, your sons, like young olive trees around your table.
19Ps 128:4 In this very way the man who fears the LORD will be blessed.
19Ps 128:5 May the LORD bless you from Zion, so that you will see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
19Ps 128:6 and will see your children's children! Peace be with Israel.
19Ps 129:1 [A song of ascents.] Since my youth they have often attacked me-- let Israel say--
19Ps 129:2 Since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not prevailed against me.
19Ps 129:3 Plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.
19Ps 129:4 The LORD is righteous; He has cut the ropes of the wicked.
19Ps 129:5 Let all who hate Zion be driven back in disgrace.
19Ps 129:6 Let them be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows up
19Ps 129:7 and can't even fill the hands of the reaper or the arms of the one who binds sheaves.
19Ps 129:8 Then none who pass by will say, "May the LORD's blessing be on you." We bless you in the name of the LORD.
19Ps 130:1 [A song of ascents.] Out of the depths I call to You, LORD!
19Ps 130:2 Lord, listen to my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my cry for help.
19Ps 130:3 LORD, if You considered sins, Lord, who could stand?
19Ps 130:4 But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be revered.
19Ps 130:5 I wait for the LORD; I wait, and put my hope in His word.
19Ps 130:6 I [wait] for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning-- more than watchmen for the morning.
19Ps 130:7 Israel, put your hope in the LORD. For there is faithful love with the Lord, and with Him is redemption in abundance.
19Ps 130:8 And He will redeem Israel from all its sins.
19Ps 131:1 [A Davidic song of ascents.] LORD, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too difficult for me.
19Ps 131:2 Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself like a little weaned child with its mother; I am like a little child.
19Ps 131:3 Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forever.
19Ps 132:1 [A song of ascents.] LORD, remember David and all the hardships he endured,
19Ps 132:2 and how he swore an oath to the LORD, making a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
19Ps 132:3 "I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
19Ps 132:4 I will not allow my eyes to sleep or my eyelids to slumber
19Ps 132:5 until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."
19Ps 132:6 We heard of [the ark] in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
19Ps 132:7 Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.
19Ps 132:8 Arise, LORD, come to Your resting place, You and the ark [that shows] Your strength.
19Ps 132:9 May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and may Your godly people shout for joy.
19Ps 132:10 Because of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.
19Ps 132:11 The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not abandon: "I will set one of your descendants on your throne.
19Ps 132:12 If your sons keep My covenant and My decrees that I will teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne, forever."
19Ps 132:13 For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:
19Ps 132:14 "This is My resting place forever; I will make My home here because I have desired it.
19Ps 132:15 I will abundantly bless its food; I will satisfy its needy with bread.
19Ps 132:16 I will clothe its priests with salvation, and its godly people will shout for joy.
19Ps 132:17 There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
19Ps 132:18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown he wears will be glorious."
19Ps 133:1 [A Davidic song of ascents.] How good and pleasant it is when brothers can live together!
19Ps 133:2 It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron's beard, on his robes.
19Ps 133:3 It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has appointed the blessing-- life forevermore.
19Ps 134:1 [A song of ascents.] Now praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD who stand in the LORD's house at night!
19Ps 134:2 Lift up your hands in the holy place, and praise the LORD!
19Ps 134:3 May the LORD, Maker of heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
19Ps 135:1 Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, you servants of the LORD
19Ps 135:2 who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
19Ps 135:3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praise to His name, for it is delightful.
19Ps 135:4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel as His treasured possession.
19Ps 135:5 For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is greater than all gods.
19Ps 135:6 The LORD does whatever He pleases in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths.
19Ps 135:7 He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
19Ps 135:8 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both people and animals.
19Ps 135:9 He sent signs and wonders against you, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his officials.
19Ps 135:10 He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:
19Ps 135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.
19Ps 135:12 He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to His people Israel.
19Ps 135:13 LORD, Your name [endures] forever, Your reputation, LORD, through all generations.
19Ps 135:14 For the LORD will judge His people and have compassion on His servants.
19Ps 135:15 The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, made by human hands.
19Ps 135:16 They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.
19Ps 135:17 They have ears, but cannot hear; indeed, there is no breath in their mouths.
19Ps 135:18 Those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them.
19Ps 135:19 House of Israel, praise the LORD! House of Aaron, praise the LORD!
19Ps 135:20 House of Levi, praise the LORD! You who revere the LORD, praise the LORD!
19Ps 135:21 May the LORD be praised from Zion; He dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!

19Ps 136:26 Give thanks to the God of heaven! His love is eternal.
19Ps 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon-- there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion.
19Ps 137:2 There we hung up our lyres on the poplar trees,
19Ps 137:3 for our captors there asked us for songs, and our tormentors, for rejoicing: "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
19Ps 137:4 How can we sing the LORD's song on foreign soil?
19Ps 137:5 If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget [its skill].
19Ps 137:6 May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!
19Ps 137:7 Remember, LORD, [what] the Edomites said that day at Jerusalem: "Destroy it! Destroy it down to its foundations!"
19Ps 137:8 Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who pays you back what you have done to us.
19Ps 137:9 Happy is he who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rocks.
19Ps 138:1 [Davidic.] I will give You thanks with all my heart; I will sing Your praise before the heavenly beings.
19Ps 138:2 I will bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your constant love and faithfulness. You have exalted Your name and Your promise above everything else.

19Ps 138:4 All the kings on earth will give You thanks, LORD, when they hear what You have promised.
19Ps 138:5 They will sing of the LORD's ways, for the LORD's glory is great.
19Ps 138:6 Though the LORD is exalted, He takes note of the humble; but He knows the haughty from afar.
19Ps 138:7 If I walk in the thick of danger, You will preserve my life from the anger of my enemies. You will extend Your hand; Your right hand will save me.
19Ps 138:8 The LORD will fulfill [His purpose] for me. LORD, Your love is eternal; do not abandon the work of Your hands.
19Ps 139:1 [For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.] LORD, You have searched me and known me.
19Ps 139:2 You know when I sit down and when I stand up; You understand my thoughts from far away.
19Ps 139:3 You observe my travels and my rest; You are aware of all my ways.
19Ps 139:4 Before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, LORD.
19Ps 139:5 You have encircled me; You have placed Your hand on me.
19Ps 139:6 [This] extraordinary knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to [reach] it.
19Ps 139:7 Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?
19Ps 139:8 If I go up to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.
19Ps 139:9 If I live at the eastern horizon [or] settle at the western limits,
19Ps 139:10 even there Your hand will lead me; Your right hand will hold on to me.
19Ps 139:11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light around me will become night"--
19Ps 139:12 even the darkness is not dark to You. The night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to You.
19Ps 139:13 For it was You who created my inward parts; You knit me together in my mother's womb.
19Ps 139:14 I will praise You, because I have been remarkably and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, and I know [this] very well.
19Ps 139:15 My bones were not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was formed in the depths of the earth.
19Ps 139:16 Your eyes saw me when I was formless; all [my] days were written in Your book and planned before a single one of them began.
19Ps 139:17 God, how difficult Your thoughts are for me [to comprehend]; how vast their sum is!
19Ps 139:18 If I counted them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; when I wake up, I am still with You.
19Ps 139:19 God, if only You would kill the wicked-- you bloodthirsty men, stay away from me--
19Ps 139:20 who invoke You deceitfully. Your enemies swear [by You] falsely.
19Ps 139:21 LORD, don't I hate those who hate You, and detest those who rebel against You?
19Ps 139:22 I hate them with extreme hatred; I consider them my enemies.

20Pr 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
20Pr 1:2 For gaining wisdom and being instructed; for understanding insightful sayings;
20Pr 1:3 for receiving wise instruction [in] righteousness, justice, and integrity;
20Pr 1:4 for teaching shrewdness to the inexperienced, knowledge and discretion to a young man--
20Pr 1:5 a wise man will listen and increase his learning, and a discerning man will obtain guidance--
20Pr 1:6 for understanding a proverb or a parable, the words of the wise, and their riddles.
20Pr 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.
20Pr 1:8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction, and don't reject your mother's teaching,
20Pr 1:9 for they will be a garland of grace on your head and a [gold] chain around your neck.
20Pr 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, don't be persuaded.
20Pr 1:11 If they say-- "Come with us! Let's set an ambush and kill someone. Let's attack some innocent person just for fun!
20Pr 1:12 Let's swallow them alive, like Sheol, still healthy as they go down to the Pit.
20Pr 1:13 We'll find all kinds of valuable property and fill our houses with plunder.
20Pr 1:14 Throw in your lot with us, and we'll all share our money"--
20Pr 1:15 my son, don't travel that road with them or set foot on their path,
20Pr 1:16 because their feet run toward trouble and they hurry to commit murder.
20Pr 1:17 It is foolish to spread a net where any bird can see it,
20Pr 1:18 but they set an ambush to kill themselves; they attack their own lives.
20Pr 1:19 Such are the paths of all who pursue gain dishonestly; it takes the lives of those who profit from it.
20Pr 1:20 Wisdom calls out in the street; she raises her voice in the public squares.
20Pr 1:21 She cries out above the commotion; she speaks at the entrance of the city gates:
20Pr 1:22 "How long, foolish ones, will you love ignorance? [How long] will [you] mockers enjoy mocking and [you] fools hate knowledge?
20Pr 1:23 If you turn to my discipline, then I will pour out my spirit on you and teach you my words.
20Pr 1:24 Since I called out and you refused, extended my hand and no one paid attention,
20Pr 1:25 since you neglected all my counsel and did not accept my correction,
20Pr 1:26 I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when terror strikes you,
20Pr 1:27 when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when trouble and stress overcome you.
20Pr 1:28 Then they will call me, but I won't answer; they will search for me, but won't find me.
20Pr 1:29 Because they hated knowledge, didn't choose to fear the LORD,
20Pr 1:30 were not interested in my counsel, and rejected all my correction,
20Pr 1:31 they will eat the fruit of their way and be glutted with their own schemes.
20Pr 1:32 For the waywardness of the inexperienced will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
20Pr 1:33 But whoever listens to me will live securely and be free from the fear of danger."
20Pr 2:1 My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,
20Pr 2:2 listening closely to wisdom and directing your heart to understanding;
20Pr 2:3 furthermore, if you call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,
20Pr 2:4 if you seek it like silver and search for it like hidden treasure,
20Pr 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.
20Pr 2:6 For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20Pr 2:7 He stores up success for the upright; He is a shield for those who live with integrity
20Pr 2:8 so that He may guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His loyal followers.
20Pr 2:9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and integrity-- every good path.
20Pr 2:10 For wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will delight your heart.
20Pr 2:11 Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,
20Pr 2:12 rescuing you from the way of evil-- from the one who says perverse things,
20Pr 2:13 [from] those who abandon the right paths to walk in ways of darkness,
20Pr 2:14 [from] those who enjoy doing evil and celebrate perversity,
20Pr 2:15 whose paths are crooked, and whose ways are devious.
20Pr 2:16 It will rescue you from a forbidden woman, from a stranger with her flattering talk,
20Pr 2:17 who abandons the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
20Pr 2:18 for her house sinks down to death and her ways to the land of the departed spirits.
20Pr 2:19 None return who go to her; none reach the paths of life.
20Pr 2:20 So follow the way of good people, and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20Pr 2:21 For the upright will inhabit the land, and those of integrity will remain in it;
20Pr 2:22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous uprooted from it.
20Pr 3:1 My son, don't forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commands;
20Pr 3:2 for they will bring you many days, a full life, and well-being.
20Pr 3:3 Never let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Tie them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 3:4 Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding;
20Pr 3:6 think about Him in all your ways, and He will guide you on the right paths.
20Pr 3:7 Don't consider yourself to be wise; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
20Pr 3:8 This will be healing for your body and strengthening for your bones.
20Pr 3:9 Honor the LORD with your possessions and with the first produce of your entire harvest;
20Pr 3:10 then your barns will be completely filled, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
20Pr 3:11 Do not despise the LORD's instruction, my son, and do not loathe His discipline;
20Pr 3:12 for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, just as a father, the son he delights in.
20Pr 3:13 Happy is a man who finds wisdom and who acquires understanding,
20Pr 3:14 for she is more profitable than silver, and her revenue is better than gold.
20Pr 3:15 She is more precious than jewels; nothing you desire compares with her.
20Pr 3:16 Long life is in her right hand; in her left, riches and honor.
20Pr 3:17 Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths, peaceful.
20Pr 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who hold on to her are happy.
20Pr 3:19 The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.
20Pr 3:20 By His knowledge the watery depths broke open, and the clouds dripped with dew.
20Pr 3:21 Maintain [your] competence and discretion. My son, don't lose sight of them.
20Pr 3:22 They will be life for you and adornment for your neck.
20Pr 3:23 Then you will go safely on your way; your foot will not stumble.
20Pr 3:24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid; you will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.
20Pr 3:25 Don't fear sudden danger or the ruin of the wicked when it comes,
20Pr 3:26 for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from a snare.
20Pr 3:27 When it is in your power, don't withhold good from the one to whom it is due.
20Pr 3:28 Don't say to your neighbor, "Go away! Come back later. I'll give it tomorrow"-- when it is there with you.
20Pr 3:29 Don't plan any harm against your neighbor, for he trusts you and lives near you.
20Pr 3:30 Don't accuse anyone without cause, when he has done you no harm.
20Pr 3:31 Don't envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;
20Pr 3:32 for the devious are detestable to the LORD, but He is a friend to the upright.
20Pr 3:33 The LORD's curse is on the household of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous;
20Pr 3:34 He mocks those who mock, but gives grace to the humble.
20Pr 3:35 The wise will inherit honor, but He holds up fools to dishonor.
20Pr 4:1 Listen, [my] sons, to a father's discipline, and pay attention so that you may gain understanding,
20Pr 4:2 for I am giving you good instruction. Don't abandon my teaching.
20Pr 4:3 When I was a son with my father, tender and precious to my mother,
20Pr 4:4 he taught me and said: "Your heart must hold on to my words. Keep my commands and live.
20Pr 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding; don't forget or turn away from the words of my mouth.
20Pr 4:6 Don't abandon wisdom, and she will watch over you; love her, and she will guard you.
20Pr 4:7 Wisdom is supreme-- so get wisdom. And whatever else you get, get understanding.
20Pr 4:8 Cherish her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.
20Pr 4:9 She will place a garland of grace on your head; she will give you a crown of beauty."
20Pr 4:10 Listen, my son. Accept my words, and you will live many years.
20Pr 4:11 I am teaching you the way of wisdom; I am guiding you on straight paths.
20Pr 4:12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; when you run, you will not stumble.
20Pr 4:13 Hold on to instruction; don't let go. Guard it, for it is your life.
20Pr 4:14 Don't set foot on the path of the wicked; don't proceed in the way of evil ones.
20Pr 4:15 Avoid it; don't travel on it. Turn away from it, and pass it by.
20Pr 4:16 For they can't sleep unless they have done what is evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.
20Pr 4:17 They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20Pr 4:18 The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.
20Pr 4:19 But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they don't know what makes them stumble.
20Pr 4:20 My son, pay attention to my words; listen closely to my sayings.
20Pr 4:21 Don't lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.
20Pr 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, and health to one's whole body.
20Pr 4:23 Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.
20Pr 4:24 Don't let your mouth speak dishonestly, and don't let your lips talk deviously.
20Pr 4:25 Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.
20Pr 4:26 Carefully consider the path for your feet, and all your ways will be established.
20Pr 4:27 Don't turn to the right or to the left; keep your feet away from evil.
20Pr 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen closely to my understanding
20Pr 5:2 so that [you] may maintain discretion and your lips safeguard knowledge.
20Pr 5:3 Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her words are smoother than oil,
20Pr 5:4 in the end she's as bitter as wormwood and as sharp as a double-edged sword.
20Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps head straight for Sheol.
20Pr 5:6 She doesn't consider the path of life; she doesn't know that her ways are unstable.
20Pr 5:7 So now, [my] sons, listen to me, and don't turn away from the words of my mouth.
20Pr 5:8 Keep your way far from her. Don't go near the door of her house.
20Pr 5:9 Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others and your years to someone cruel;
20Pr 5:10 strangers will drain your resources, and your earnings will end up in a foreigner's house.
20Pr 5:11 At the end of your life, you will lament when your physical body has been consumed,
20Pr 5:12 and you will say, "How I hated discipline, and how my heart despised correction.
20Pr 5:13 I didn't obey my teachers or listen closely to my mentors.
20Pr 5:14 I was on the verge of complete ruin before the entire community."
20Pr 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, water flowing from your own well.
20Pr 5:16 Should your springs flow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?
20Pr 5:17 They should be for you alone and not for you [to share] with strangers.
20Pr 5:18 Let your fountain be blessed, and take pleasure in the wife of your youth.
20Pr 5:19 A loving doe, a graceful fawn-- let her breasts always satisfy you; be lost in her love forever.
20Pr 5:20 Why, my son, would you be infatuated with a forbidden woman or embrace the breast of a stranger?
20Pr 5:21 For a man's ways are before the LORD's eyes, and He considers all his paths.
20Pr 5:22 A wicked man's iniquities entrap him; he is entangled in the ropes of his own sin.
20Pr 5:23 He will die because there is no instruction, and be lost because of his great stupidity.
20Pr 6:1 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor or entered into an agreement with a stranger,
20Pr 6:2 you have been trapped by the words of your lips-- ensnared by the words of your mouth.
20Pr 6:3 Do this, then, my son, and free yourself, for you have put yourself in your neighbor's power: Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
20Pr 6:4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
20Pr 6:5 Escape like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from a fowler's trap.
20Pr 6:6 Go to the ant, you slacker! Observe its ways and become wise.
20Pr 6:7 Without leader, administrator, or ruler,
20Pr 6:8 it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food during harvest.
20Pr 6:9 How long will you stay in bed, you slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?
20Pr 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest,
20Pr 6:11 and your poverty will come like a robber, your need, like a bandit.
20Pr 6:12 A worthless person, a wicked man, who goes around speaking dishonestly,
20Pr 6:13 who winks his eyes, signals with his feet, and gestures with his fingers,
20Pr 6:14 who plots evil with perversity in his heart-- he stirs up trouble constantly.
20Pr 6:15 Therefore calamity will strike him suddenly; he will be shattered instantly-- beyond recovery.
20Pr 6:16 Six things the LORD hates; in fact, seven are detestable to Him:
20Pr 6:17 arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
20Pr 6:18 a heart that plots wicked schemes, feet eager to run to evil,
20Pr 6:19 a lying witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up trouble among brothers.
20Pr 6:20 My son, keep your father's command, and don't reject your mother's teaching.
20Pr 6:21 Always bind them to your heart; tie them around your neck.
20Pr 6:22 When you walk here and there, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will talk to you.
20Pr 6:23 For a commandment is a lamp, teaching is a light, and corrective instructions are the way to life.
20Pr 6:24 They will protect you from an evil woman, from the flattering tongue of a stranger.
20Pr 6:25 Don't lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyelashes.
20Pr 6:26 For a prostitute's fee is only a loaf of bread, but an adulteress goes after [your] very life.
20Pr 6:27 Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?
20Pr 6:28 Can a man walk on coals without scorching his feet?
20Pr 6:29 So it is with the one who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20Pr 6:30 People don't despise the thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.
20Pr 6:31 Still, if caught, he must pay seven times as much; he must give up all the wealth in his house.
20Pr 6:32 The one who commits adultery lacks sense; whoever does so destroys himself.
20Pr 6:33 He will get a beating and dishonor, and his disgrace will never be removed.
20Pr 6:34 For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20Pr 6:35 He will not be appeased by anything or be persuaded by lavish gifts.
20Pr 7:1 My son, obey my words, and treasure my commands.
20Pr 7:2 Keep my commands and live; protect my teachings as you would the pupil of your eye.
20Pr 7:3 Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding [your] relative.
20Pr 7:5 She will keep you from a forbidden woman, a stranger with her flattering talk.
20Pr 7:6 At the window of my house I looked through my lattice.
20Pr 7:7 I saw among the inexperienced, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking sense.
20Pr 7:8 Crossing the street near her corner, he strolled down the road to her house
20Pr 7:9 at twilight, in the evening, in the dark of the night.
20Pr 7:10 A woman came to meet him, dressed like a prostitute, having a hidden agenda.
20Pr 7:11 She is loud and defiant; her feet do not stay at home.
20Pr 7:12 Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.
20Pr 7:13 She grabs him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him,
20Pr 7:14 "I've made fellowship offerings; today I've fulfilled my vows.
20Pr 7:15 So I came out to meet you, to search for you, and I've found you.
20Pr 7:16 I've spread coverings on my bed-- richly colored linen from Egypt.
20Pr 7:17 I've perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20Pr 7:18 Come, let's drink deeply of lovemaking until morning. Let's feast on each other's love!
20Pr 7:19 My husband isn't home; he went on a long journey.
20Pr 7:20 He took a bag of money with him and will come home at the time of the full moon."
20Pr 7:21 She seduces him with her persistent pleading; she lures with her flattering talk.
20Pr 7:22 He follows her impulsively like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding toward a trap
20Pr 7:23 until an arrow pierces its liver, like a bird darting into a snare-- he doesn't know it will cost him his life.
20Pr 7:24 Now, [my] sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
20Pr 7:25 Don't let your heart turn aside to her ways; don't stray onto her paths.
20Pr 7:26 For she has brought many down to death; her victims are countless.
20Pr 7:27 Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
20Pr 8:1 Doesn't Wisdom call out? Doesn't Understanding make her voice heard?
20Pr 8:2 At the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads, she takes her stand.
20Pr 8:3 Beside the gates at the entry to the city, at the main entrance, she cries out:
20Pr 8:4 "People, I call out to you; my cry is to mankind.
20Pr 8:5 Learn to be shrewd, you who are inexperienced; develop common sense, you who are foolish.
20Pr 8:6 Listen, for I speak of noble things, and what my lips say is right.
20Pr 8:7 For my mouth tells the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
20Pr 8:8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; none of them are deceptive or perverse.
20Pr 8:9 All of them are clear to the perceptive, and right to those who discover knowledge.
20Pr 8:10 Accept my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.
20Pr 8:11 For wisdom is better than precious stones, and nothing desirable can compare with it.
20Pr 8:12 I, Wisdom, share a home with shrewdness and have knowledge and discretion.
20Pr 8:13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.
20Pr 8:14 I possess good advice and competence; I have understanding and strength.
20Pr 8:15 It is by me that kings reign and rulers enact just law;
20Pr 8:16 by me, princes lead, as do nobles [and] all righteous judges.
20Pr 8:17 I love those who love me, and those who search for me find me.
20Pr 8:18 With me are riches and honor, lasting wealth and righteousness.
20Pr 8:19 My fruit is better than solid gold, and my harvest than pure silver.
20Pr 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20Pr 8:21 giving wealth as an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
20Pr 8:22 The LORD made me at the beginning of His creation, before His works of long ago.
20Pr 8:23 I was formed before ancient times, from the beginning, before the earth began.
20Pr 8:24 I was brought forth when there were no watery depths and no springs filled with water.
20Pr 8:25 I was brought forth before the mountains and hills were established,
20Pr 8:26 before He made the land, the fields, or the first soil on earth.
20Pr 8:27 I was there when He established the heavens, when He laid out the horizon on the surface of the ocean,
20Pr 8:28 when He placed the skies above, when the fountains of the ocean gushed forth,
20Pr 8:29 when He set a limit for the sea so that the waters would not violate His command, when He laid out the foundations of the earth.
20Pr 8:30 I was a skilled craftsman beside Him. I was His delight every day, always rejoicing before Him.
20Pr 8:31 I was rejoicing in His inhabited world, delighting in the human race.
20Pr 8:32 And now, [my] sons, listen to me; those who keep my ways are happy.
20Pr 8:33 Listen to instruction and be wise; don't ignore it.
20Pr 8:34 Anyone who listens to me is happy, watching at my doors every day, waiting by the posts of my doorway.
20Pr 8:35 For the one who finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD,
20Pr 8:36 but the one who sins against me harms himself; all who hate me love death."
20Pr 9:1 Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.
20Pr 9:2 She has prepared her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
20Pr 9:3 She has sent out her servants; she calls out from the highest points of the city:
20Pr 9:4 "Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!" To the one who lacks sense, she says,
20Pr 9:5 "Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed.
20Pr 9:6 Leave inexperience behind, and you will live; pursue the way of understanding.
20Pr 9:7 The one who corrects a mocker will bring dishonor on himself; the one who rebukes a wicked man will get hurt.
20Pr 9:8 Don't rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
20Pr 9:9 Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will learn more.
20Pr 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
20Pr 9:11 For by Wisdom your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.
20Pr 9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for your own benefit; if you mock, you alone will bear [the consequences]."
20Pr 9:13 The woman Folly is rowdy; she is gullible and knows nothing.
20Pr 9:14 She sits by the doorway of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,
20Pr 9:15 calling to those who pass by, who go straight ahead on their paths:
20Pr 9:16 "Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!" To the one who lacks sense, she says,
20Pr 9:17 "Stolen water is sweet, and bread [eaten] secretly is tasty!"
20Pr 9:18 But he doesn't know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

20Pr 23:35 "They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I didn't know it! When will I wake up? I'll look for another [drink]."
20Pr 24:1 Don't envy evil men or desire to be with them,
20Pr 24:2 for their hearts plan violence, and their words stir up trouble.
20Pr 24:3 A house is built by wisdom, and it is established by understanding;
20Pr 24:4 by knowledge the rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.
20Pr 24:5 A wise warrior is better than a strong one, and a man of knowledge than one of strength;
20Pr 24:6 for you should wage war with sound guidance-- victory comes with many counselors.
20Pr 24:7 Wisdom is inaccessible to a fool; he does not open his mouth at the gate.
20Pr 24:8 The one who plots evil will be called a schemer.

20Pr 24:10 If you do nothing in a difficult time, your strength is limited.
20Pr 24:11 Rescue those being taken off to death, and save those stumbling toward slaughter.
20Pr 24:12 If you say, "But we didn't know about this," won't He who weighs hearts consider it? Won't He who protects your life know? Won't He repay a person according to his work?
20Pr 24:13 Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your palate;
20Pr 24:14 realize that wisdom is the same for you. If you find it, you will have a future, and your hope will never fade.
20Pr 24:15 Don't set an ambush, wicked man, at the camp of the righteous man; don't destroy his dwelling.
20Pr 24:16 Though a righteous man falls seven times, he will get up, but the wicked will stumble into ruin.
20Pr 24:17 Don't gloat when your enemy falls, and don't let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,
20Pr 24:18 or the LORD will see, be displeased, and turn His wrath away from him.
20Pr 24:19 Don't worry because of evildoers, and don't envy the wicked.

20Pr 24:22 for their destruction will come suddenly; who knows what disaster these two can bring?
20Pr 24:23 These [sayings] also belong to the wise: It is not good to show partiality in judgment.
20Pr 24:24 Whoever says to the guilty, "You are innocent"-- people will curse him, and tribes will denounce him;
20Pr 24:25 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and a generous blessing will come to them.

20Pr 24:30 I went by the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking sense.
20Pr 24:31 Thistles had come up everywhere, weeds covered the ground, and the stone wall was ruined.
20Pr 24:32 I saw, and took it to heart; I looked, and received instruction:
20Pr 24:33 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest,
20Pr 24:34 and your poverty will come like a robber, your need, like a bandit.
20Pr 25:1 These too are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied.

20Pr 25:6 Don't brag about yourself before the king, and don't stand in the place of the great;
20Pr 25:7 for it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here!" than to demote you in plain view of a noble.
20Pr 25:8 Don't take a matter to court hastily. Otherwise, what will you do afterwards if your opponent humiliates you?

20Pr 26:13 The slacker says, "There's a lion in the road-- a lion in the public square!"
20Pr 26:14 A door turns on its hinge, and a slacker, on his bed.

20Pr 26:19 so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I was only joking!"
20Pr 26:20 Without wood, fire goes out; without a gossip, conflict dies down.

20Pr 27:8 A man wandering from his home is like a bird wandering from its nest.
20Pr 27:9 Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is better than self-counsel.
20Pr 27:10 Don't abandon your friend or your father's friend, and don't go to your brother's house in your time of calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
20Pr 27:11 Be wise, my son, and bring my heart joy, so that I can answer anyone who taunts me.
20Pr 27:12 The sensible see danger and take cover; the foolish keep going and are punished.

20Pr 27:21 Silver is [tested] in a crucible, gold in a smelter, and a man, by the praise he receives.
20Pr 27:22 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, you will not separate his foolishness from him.
20Pr 27:23 Know well the condition of your flock, and pay attention to your herds,
20Pr 27:24 for wealth is not forever; not even a crown lasts for all time.
20Pr 27:25 When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grain from the hills is gathered in,
20Pr 27:26 lambs will provide your clothing, and goats, the price of a field;
20Pr 27:27 there will be enough goat's milk for your food-- food for your household and nourishment for your servants.

20Pr 28:22 A greedy man is in a hurry for wealth; he doesn't know that poverty will come to him.
20Pr 28:23 One who rebukes a person will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.
20Pr 28:24 The one who robs his father or mother and says, "That's no sin," is a companion to a man who destroys.

20Pr 28:26 The one who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.
20Pr 28:27 The one who gives to the poor will not be in need, but one who turns his eyes away will receive many curses.
20Pr 28:28 When the wicked come to power, people hide, but when they are destroyed, the righteous flourish.

20Pr 29:12 If a ruler listens to lies, all his servants will be wicked.
20Pr 29:13 The poor and the oppressor have this in common: the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
20Pr 29:14 A king who judges the poor with fairness-- his throne will be established forever.
20Pr 29:15 A rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a youth left to himself is a disgrace to his mother.
20Pr 29:16 When the wicked increase, rebellion increases, but the righteous will see their downfall.
20Pr 29:17 Discipline your son, and he will give you comfort; he will also give you delight.
20Pr 29:18 Without revelation people run wild, but one who keeps the law will be happy.
20Pr 29:19 A servant cannot be disciplined by words; though he understands, he doesn't respond.
20Pr 29:20 Do you see a man who speaks too soon? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

20Pr 30:1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man's oration to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
20Pr 30:2 I am the least intelligent of men, and I lack man's ability to understand.
20Pr 30:3 I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.
20Pr 30:4 Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in His hands? Who has bound up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is the name of His Son-- if you know?
20Pr 30:5 Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
20Pr 30:6 Don't add to His words, or He will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar.
20Pr 30:7 Two things I ask of You; don't deny them to me before I die:
20Pr 30:8 Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor wealth; feed me with the food I need.
20Pr 30:9 Otherwise, I might have too much and deny You, saying, "Who is the LORD?" or I might have nothing and steal, profaning the name of my God.
20Pr 30:10 Don't slander a servant to his master, or he will curse you, and you will become guilty.
20Pr 30:11 There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother.
20Pr 30:12 There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filth.
20Pr 30:13 There is a generation-- how haughty its eyes and pretentious its looks.
20Pr 30:14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, devouring the oppressed from the land and the needy from among mankind.
20Pr 30:15 The leech has two daughters: Give, Give. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough!":
20Pr 30:16 Sheol; a barren womb; earth, which is never satisfied with water; and fire, which never says, "Enough!"
20Pr 30:17 As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.
20Pr 30:18 Three things are beyond me; four I can't understand:
20Pr 30:19 the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.
20Pr 30:20 This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I've done nothing wrong."
20Pr 30:21 The earth trembles under three things; it cannot bear up under four:
20Pr 30:22 a servant when he becomes king, a fool when he is stuffed with food,
20Pr 30:23 an unloved woman when she marries, and a serving girl when she ousts her lady.
20Pr 30:24 Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:
20Pr 30:25 the ants are not a strong people, yet they store up their food in the summer;
20Pr 30:26 hyraxes are not a mighty people, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
20Pr 30:27 locusts have no king, yet all of them march in ranks;
20Pr 30:28 a lizard can be caught in your hands, yet it lives in kings' palaces.
20Pr 30:29 Three things are stately in their stride, even four are stately in their walk:
20Pr 30:30 a lion, which is mightiest among beasts and doesn't retreat before anything,
20Pr 30:31 a strutting rooster, a goat, and a king at the head of his army.
20Pr 30:32 If you have been foolish by exalting yourself, or if you've been scheming, put your hand over your mouth.
20Pr 30:33 For the churning of milk produces butter, and twisting a nose draws blood, and stirring up anger produces strife.
20Pr 31:1 The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:
20Pr 31:2 What [should I say], my son? What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?
20Pr 31:3 Don't spend your energy on women or your efforts on those who destroy kings.
20Pr 31:4 It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers [to desire] beer.
20Pr 31:5 Otherwise, they will drink, forget what is decreed, and pervert justice for all the oppressed.
20Pr 31:6 Give beer to one who is dying, and wine to one whose life is bitter.
20Pr 31:7 Let him drink so that he can forget his poverty and remember his trouble no more.
20Pr 31:8 Speak up for those who have no voice, for the justice of all who are dispossessed.
20Pr 31:9 Speak up, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.
20Pr 31:10 Who can find a capable wife? She is far more precious than jewels.
20Pr 31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will not lack anything good.
20Pr 31:12 She rewards him with good, not evil, all the days of her life.
20Pr 31:13 She selects wool and flax and works with willing hands.
20Pr 31:14 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from far away.
20Pr 31:15 She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and portions for her servants.
20Pr 31:16 She evaluates a field and buys it; she plants a vineyard with her earnings.
20Pr 31:17 She draws on her strength and reveals that her arms are strong.
20Pr 31:18 She sees that her profits are good, and her lamp never goes out at night.
20Pr 31:19 She extends her hands to the spinning staff, and her hands hold the spindle.
20Pr 31:20 Her hands reach out to the poor, and she extends her hands to the needy.
20Pr 31:21 She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all in her household are doubly clothed.
20Pr 31:22 She makes her own bed coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20Pr 31:23 Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land.
20Pr 31:24 She makes and sells linen garments; she delivers belts to the merchants.
20Pr 31:25 Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the time to come.
20Pr 31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and loving instruction is on her tongue.
20Pr 31:27 She watches over the activities of her household and is never idle.
20Pr 31:28 Her sons rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:
20Pr 31:29 "Many women are capable, but you surpass them all!"
20Pr 31:30 Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD will be praised.
20Pr 31:31 Give her the reward of her labor, and let her works praise her at the city gates.

21Ec 1:1 The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:2 "Absolute futility," says the Teacher. "Absolute futility. Everything is futile."
21Ec 1:3 What does a man gain for all his efforts he labors at under the sun?
21Ec 1:4 A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
21Ec 1:5 The sun rises and the sun sets; panting, [it returns] to its place where it rises.
21Ec 1:6 Gusting to the south, turning to the north, turning, turning, goes the wind, and the wind returns in its cycles.
21Ec 1:7 All the streams flow to the sea, yet the sea is never full. The streams are flowing to the place, and they flow there again.
21Ec 1:8 All things are wearisome; man is unable to speak. The eye is not satisfied by seeing or the ear filled with hearing.
21Ec 1:9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun.
21Ec 1:10 Can one say about anything, "Look, this is new"? It has already existed in the ages before us.
21Ec 1:11 There is no memory of those who came before; and of those who will come after there will also be no memory among those who follow [them].
21Ec 1:12 I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:13 I applied my mind to seek and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people this miserable task to keep them occupied.
21Ec 1:14 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 1:15 What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
21Ec 1:16 I said to myself, "Look, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped wisdom and knowledge."
21Ec 1:17 I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 1:18 For with much wisdom is much sorrow; as knowledge increases, grief increases.
21Ec 2:1 I said to myself, "Go ahead, I will test you with pleasure and enjoy what is good." But it turned out to be futile.
21Ec 2:2 I said about laughter, "It is madness," and about pleasure, "What does this accomplish?"
21Ec 2:3 I explored with my mind how to let my body enjoy life with wine and how to grasp folly-- my mind still guiding me with wisdom-- until I could see what is good for people to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
21Ec 2:4 I increased my achievements. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
21Ec 2:5 I made gardens and parks for myself and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.
21Ec 2:6 I constructed reservoirs of water for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.
21Ec 2:7 I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house. I also owned many herds of cattle and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.
21Ec 2:8 I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered male and female singers for myself, and many concubines, the delights of men.
21Ec 2:9 Thus, I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom also remained with me.
21Ec 2:10 All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them. I did not refuse myself any pleasure, for I took pleasure in all my struggles. This was my reward for all my struggles.
21Ec 2:11 When I considered all that I had accomplished and what I had labored to achieve, I found everything to be futile and a pursuit of the wind. There was nothing to be gained under the sun.
21Ec 2:12 Then I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly, for what will the man be like who comes after the king? He will do what has already been done.
21Ec 2:13 And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness.
21Ec 2:14 The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also knew that one fate comes to them both.
21Ec 2:15 So I said to myself, "What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise?" And I said to myself that this is also futile.
21Ec 2:16 For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man, since in the days to come both will be forgotten. How is it that the wise man dies just like the fool?
21Ec 2:17 Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 2:18 I hated all my work at which I labored under the sun because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
21Ec 2:19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.
21Ec 2:20 So I began to give myself over to despair concerning all my work I had labored at under the sun.
21Ec 2:21 For there is a man whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, but he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it. This too is futile and a great wrong.
21Ec 2:22 For what does a man get with all his work and all his efforts that he labors with under the sun?
21Ec 2:23 For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.
21Ec 2:24 There is nothing better for man than to eat, drink, and to enjoyhis work. I have seen that even this is from God's hand.
21Ec 2:25 For who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from Him?
21Ec 2:26 For to the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and accumulating in order to give to the one who is pleasing in God's sight. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 3:1 There is an occasion for everything, and a time for every activity under heaven:
21Ec 3:2 a time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot;
21Ec 3:3 a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build;
21Ec 3:4 a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;
21Ec 3:5 a time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to avoid embracing;
21Ec 3:6 a time to search and a time to count as lost; a time to keep and a time to throw away;
21Ec 3:7 a time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak;
21Ec 3:8 a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.
21Ec 3:9 What does the worker gain from his struggles?
21Ec 3:10 I have seen the task that God has given people to keep them occupied.
21Ec 3:11 He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts, but man cannot discover the work God has done from beginning to end.
21Ec 3:12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the good life.
21Ec 3:13 It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts.
21Ec 3:14 I know that all God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it. God works so that people will be in awe of Him.
21Ec 3:15 Whatever is, has already been, and whatever will be, already is. God repeats what has passed.
21Ec 3:16 I also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness.
21Ec 3:17 I said to myself, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every work."
21Ec 3:18 I said to myself, "This happens concerning people, so that God may test them and they may see for themselves that they are like animals."
21Ec 3:19 For the fate of people and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals, for everything is futile.
21Ec 3:20 All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust.
21Ec 3:21 Who knows if the spirit of people rises upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?
21Ec 3:22 I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities, because that is his reward. For who can enable him to see what will happen after he dies?
21Ec 4:1 Again, I observed all the acts of oppression being done under the sun. Look at the tears of those who are oppressed; they have no one to comfort them. Power is with those who oppress them; they have no one to comfort them.
21Ec 4:2 So I admired the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.
21Ec 4:3 But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.
21Ec 4:4 I saw that all labor and all skillful work is due to a man's jealousy of his friend. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 4:5 The fool folds his arms and consumes his own flesh.
21Ec 4:6 Better one handful with rest, than two handfuls with effort and pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 4:7 Again, I saw futility under the sun:
21Ec 4:8 There is a person without a companion, without even a son or brother, and though there is no end to all his struggles, his eyes are still not content with riches. "So who am I struggling for," [he asks,] "and depriving myself from good?" This too is futile and a miserable task.
21Ec 4:9 Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts.
21Ec 4:10 For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up.
21Ec 4:11 Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm?
21Ec 4:12 And if somebody overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.
21Ec 4:13 Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings.
21Ec 4:14 For he came from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
21Ec 4:15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun follow a second youth who succeeds him.
21Ec 4:16 There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 5:1  Guard your step when you go to the house of God. Better to draw near in obedience than to offer the sacrifice as fools do, for they are ignorant and do wrong.
21Ec 5:2  Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.
21Ec 5:3 For dreams result from much work and a fool's voice from many words.
21Ec 5:4 When you make a vow to God, don't delay fulfilling it, because He does not delight in fools. Fulfill what you vow.
21Ec 5:5 Better that you do not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.
21Ec 5:6 Do not let your mouth bring guilt on you, and do not say in the presence of the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?
21Ec 5:7 For many dreams bring futility, also many words. So, fear God.
21Ec 5:8 If you see oppression of the poor and perversion of justice and righteousness in the province, don't be astonished at the situation, because one official protects another official, and higher officials [protect] them.
21Ec 5:9 The profit from the land is taken by all; the king is served by the field.
21Ec 5:10 The one who loves money is never satisfied with money, and whoever loves wealth [is] never [satisfied] with income. This too is futile.
21Ec 5:11 When good things increase, the ones who consume them multiply; what, then, is the profit to the owner, except to gaze at them with his eyes?
21Ec 5:12 The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich permits him no sleep.
21Ec 5:13 There is a sickening tragedy I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
21Ec 5:14 That wealth was lost in a bad venture, so when he fathered a son, he was empty-handed.
21Ec 5:15 As he came from his mother's womb, so he will go again, naked as he came; he will take nothing for his efforts that he can carry in his hands.
21Ec 5:16 This too is a sickening tragedy: exactly as he comes, so he will go. What does he gain who struggles for the wind?
21Ec 5:17 What is more, he eats in darkness all his days, with much sorrow, sickness, and anger.
21Ec 5:18 Here is what I have seen to be good: it is appropriate to eat, drink, and experience good in all the labor one does under the sun during the few days of his life God has given him, because that is his reward.
21Ec 5:19 God has also given riches and wealth to every man, and He has allowed him to enjoy them, take his reward, and rejoice in his labor. This is a gift of God,
21Ec 5:20 for he does not often consider the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
21Ec 6:1 Here is a tragedy I have observed under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity:
21Ec 6:2 God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor so that he lacks nothing of all he desires for himself, but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a sickening tragedy.
21Ec 6:3 A man may father a hundred children and live many years. No matter how long he lives, if he is not satisfied by good things and does not even have a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
21Ec 6:4 For he comes in futility and he goes in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness.
21Ec 6:5 Though a stillborn child does not see the sun and is not conscious, it has more rest than he.
21Ec 6:6 And if he lives a thousand years twice, but does not experience happiness, do not both go to the same place?
21Ec 6:7 All man's labor is for his stomach, yet the appetite is never satisfied.
21Ec 6:8 What advantage then does the wise man have over the fool? What [advantage] is there for the poor person who knows how to conduct himself before others?
21Ec 6:9 Better what the eyes see than wandering desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
21Ec 6:10 Whatever exists was given its name long ago, and who man is, is known. But he is not able to contend with the One stronger than he.
21Ec 6:11 For when there are many words, they increase futility. What is the advantage for man?
21Ec 6:12 For who knows what is good for man in life, in the few days of his futile life that he spends like a shadow? Who can tell man what will happen after him under the sun?
21Ec 7:1 A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of one's death than the day of one's birth.
21Ec 7:2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, since that is the end of all mankind, and the living should take it to heart.
21Ec 7:3 Grief is better than laughter, for when a face is sad, a heart may be glad.
21Ec 7:4 The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure.
21Ec 7:5 It is better to listen to rebuke from a wise person than to listen to the song of fools.
21Ec 7:6 For like the crackling of [burning] thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.
21Ec 7:7 Surely, the practice of extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe destroys the mind.
21Ec 7:8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning; a patient spirit is better than a proud spirit.
21Ec 7:9 Don't let your spirit rush to be angry, for anger abides in the heart of fools.
21Ec 7:10 Don't say, "Why were the former days better than these?" For it is not wise of you to ask this.
21Ec 7:11 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and an advantage to those who see the sun.
21Ec 7:12 For wisdom is protection as money is protection, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
21Ec 7:13 Consider the work of God; for who can straighten out what He has made crooked?
21Ec 7:14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider: without question, God has made the one as well as the other, so that man cannot discover anything that will come after him.
21Ec 7:15 In my futile life I have seen everything: there is a righteous man who perishes in spite of his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in spite of his evil.
21Ec 7:16 Don't be excessively righteous, and don't be overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
21Ec 7:17 Don't be excessively wicked, and don't be foolish. Why should you die before your time?
21Ec 7:18 It is good that you grasp the one and do not let the other slip from your hand. For the one who fears God will end up with both of them.
21Ec 7:19 Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers of a city.
21Ec 7:20 There is certainly no righteous man on the earth who does good and never sins.
21Ec 7:21 Don't pay attention to everything people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you;
21Ec 7:22 for you know that many times you yourself have cursed others.
21Ec 7:23 I have tested all this by wisdom. I resolved, "I will be wise," but it was beyond me.
21Ec 7:24 What exists is beyond [reach] and very deep. Who can discover it?
21Ec 7:25 I turned my thoughts to know, explore, and seek wisdom and an explanation [for things], and to know that wickedness is stupidity and folly is madness.
21Ec 7:26 And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a trap, her heart a net, and her hands chains. The one who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner will be captured by her.
21Ec 7:27 "Look," says the Teacher, "this I have discovered, by adding one thing to another to find out the explanation,
21Ec 7:28 which my soul continually searches for but does not find: among a thousand [people] I have found one [true] man, but among all these I have not found a true woman.
21Ec 7:29 Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright, but they pursued many schemes."
21Ec 8:1 Who is like the wise person, and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom brightens his face, and the sternness of his face is changed.
21Ec 8:2 Keep the king's command. Concerning an oath by God,
21Ec 8:3 do not be in a hurry. Leave his presence, and don't persist in a bad cause, since he will do whatever he wants.
21Ec 8:4 For the king's word is authoritative, and who can say to him, "What are you doing?"
21Ec 8:5 The one who keeps a command will not experience anything harmful, and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure.
21Ec 8:6 For every activity there is a right time and procedure, even though man's troubles are heavy on him.
21Ec 8:7 Yet no one knows what will happen, because who can tell him what will happen?
21Ec 8:8 No one has authority over the wind to restrain it, and there is no authority over the day of death; there is no furlough in battle, and wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape.
21Ec 8:9 All this I have seen, applying my mind to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when one man has authority over another to his harm.
21Ec 8:10 In such circumstances, I saw the wicked buried. They came and went from the holy place, and they were praised in the city where they did so. This too is futile.
21Ec 8:11 Because the sentence against a criminal act is not carried out quickly, therefore the heart of people is filled [with the desire] to commit crime.
21Ec 8:12 Although a sinner commits crime a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will go well with God-fearing people, for they are reverent before Him.
21Ec 8:13 However, it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not lengthen their days like a shadow, for they are not reverent before God.
21Ec 8:14 There is a futility that is done on the earth: there are righteous people who get what the actions of the wicked deserve, and there are wicked people who get what the actions of the righteous deserve. I say that this too is futile.
21Ec 8:15 So I commended enjoyment, because there is nothing better for man under the sun except to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, for this will accompany him in his labor during the years of his days that God gives him under the sun.
21Ec 8:16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the activity that is done on the earth (even though one's eyes do not close in sleep day or night),
21Ec 8:17 I observed all the work of God [and concluded] that man is unable to discover the work that is done under the sun. Even though a man labors hard to explore it, he cannot find it; even if the wise man claims to know it, he is unable to discover it.
21Ec 9:1 Indeed, I took all this to heart and explained it all: the righteous, the wise, and their works are in God's hands. People don't know whether [to expect] love or hate. Everything lies ahead of them.
21Ec 9:2 Everything is the same for everyone: there is one fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the bad, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner, as for the one who takes an oath, so for the one who fears an oath.
21Ec 9:3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: there is one fate for everyone. In addition, the hearts of people are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live-- after that they go to the dead.
21Ec 9:4 But there is hope for whoever is joined with all the living, since a live dog is better than a dead lion.
21Ec 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't know anything. There is no longer a reward for them because the memory of them is forgotten.
21Ec 9:6 Their love, their hate, and their envy have already disappeared, and there is no longer a portion for them in all that is done under the sun.
21Ec 9:7 Go, eat your bread with pleasure, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your works.
21Ec 9:8 Let your clothes be white all the time, and never let oil be lacking on your head.
21Ec 9:9 Enjoy life with the wife you love all the days of your fleeting life, which has been given to you under the sun, all your fleeting days. For that is your portion in life and in your struggle under the sun.
21Ec 9:10 Whatever your hands find to do, do with [all] your strength, because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in Sheol where you are going.
21Ec 9:11 Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, or bread to the wise, or riches to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all of them.
21Ec 9:12 For man certainly does not know his time: like fish caught in a cruel net, or like birds caught in a trap, so people are trapped in an evil time, as it suddenly falls on them.
21Ec 9:13 I have observed that this also is wisdom under the sun, and it is significant to me:
21Ec 9:14 There was a small city with few men in it. A great king came against it, surrounded it, and built large siege works against it.
21Ec 9:15 Now a poor wise man was found in the city, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
21Ec 9:16 And I said, "Wisdom is better than strength, but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heeded."
21Ec 9:17 The calm words of the wise are heeded more than the shouts of a ruler over fools.
21Ec 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much good.
21Ec 10:1 Dead flies make a perfumer's oil ferment and stink; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
21Ec 10:2 A wise man's heart [goes] to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.
21Ec 10:3 Even when the fool walks along the road, his heart lacks sense, and he shows everyone he is a fool.
21Ec 10:4 If the ruler's anger rises against you, don't leave your place, for calmness puts great offenses to rest.
21Ec 10:5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, an error proceeding from the presence of the ruler:
21Ec 10:6 The fool is appointed to great heights, but the rich remain in lowly positions.
21Ec 10:7 I have seen slaves on horses, but princes walking on the ground like slaves.
21Ec 10:8 The one who digs a pit may fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
21Ec 10:9 The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them; the one who splits trees may be endangered by them.
21Ec 10:10 If the axe is dull, and one does not sharpen its edge, then one must exert more strength; however, the advantage of wisdom is that it brings success.
21Ec 10:11 If the snake bites before it is charmed, then there is no advantage for the charmer.
21Ec 10:12 The words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.
21Ec 10:13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly, but the end of his speaking is evil madness.
21Ec 10:14 Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what will happen, and who can tell anyone what will happen after him?
21Ec 10:15 The struggles of fools weary them, for they don't know how to go to the city.
21Ec 10:16 Woe to you, land, when your king is a household servant, and your princes feast in the morning.
21Ec 10:17 Blessed are you, land, when your king is a son of nobles and your princes feast at the proper time-- for strength and not for drunkenness.
21Ec 10:18 Because of laziness the roof caves in, and because of negligent hands the house leaks.
21Ec 10:19 A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life happy, and money is the answer for everything.
21Ec 10:20 Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, and do not curse a rich person even in your bedroom, for a bird of the sky may carry the message, and a winged creature may report the matter.
21Ec 11:1 Send your bread on the surface of the waters, for after many days you may find it.
21Ec 11:2 Give a portion to seven or even to eight, for you don't know what disaster may happen on earth.
21Ec 11:3 If the clouds are full, they will pour out rain on the earth; whether a tree falls to the south or the north, the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
21Ec 11:4 One who watches the wind will not sow, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.
21Ec 11:5 Just as you don't know the path of the wind, or how bones [develop] in the womb of a pregnant woman, so you don't know the work of God who makes everything.
21Ec 11:6 In the morning sow your seed, and at evening do not let your hand rest, because you don't know which will succeed, whether one or the other, or if both of them will be equally good.
21Ec 11:7 Light is sweet, and it is pleasing for the eyes to see the sun.
21Ec 11:8 For if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and let him remember the days of darkness, since they will be many. All that comes is futile.
21Ec 11:9 Rejoice, young man, while you are young, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth. And walk in the ways of your heart and in the sights of your eyes; but know that for all of these things God will bring you to judgment.
21Ec 11:10 Remove sorrow from your heart, and put away pain from your flesh, because youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
21Ec 12:1 So remember your Creator in the days of your youth: Before the days of adversity come, and the years approach when you will say, "I have no delight in them";
21Ec 12:2 before the sun and the light are darkened, and the moon and the stars, and the clouds return after the rain;
21Ec 12:3 on the day when the guardians of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, the women who grind cease because they are few, and the ones who watch through the windows see dimly,
21Ec 12:4 and the doors at the street are shut while the sound of the mill fades; when one rises at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song grow faint.
21Ec 12:5 Also, they are afraid of heights and dangers on the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper loses its spring, and the caper berry has no effect; for man is headed to his eternal home, and mourners will walk around in the street;
21Ec 12:6 before the silver cord is snapped, and the golden bowl is broken, and the jar is shattered at the spring, and the wheel is broken into the well;
21Ec 12:7 and the dust returns to the earth as it once was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
21Ec 12:8 "Absolute futility," says the Teacher. "Everything is futile."
21Ec 12:9 In addition to the Teacher being a wise man, he constantly taught the people knowledge; he weighed, explored, and arranged many proverbs.
21Ec 12:10 The Teacher sought to find delightful sayings and to accurately write words of truth.
21Ec 12:11 The sayings of the wise are like goads, and those from masters of collections are like firmly embedded nails. The sayings are given by one Shepherd.
21Ec 12:12 But beyond these, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.
21Ec 12:13 When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is: fear God and keep His commands, because this [is for] all humanity.
21Ec 12:14 For God will bring every act to judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil.

22Sg 1:1 Solomon's Finest Song
22Sg 1:2 Oh, that he would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is more delightful than wine.
22Sg 1:3 The fragrance of your perfume is intoxicating; your name is perfume poured out. No wonder young women adore you.
22Sg 1:4 Take me with you-- let us hurry. Oh, that the king would bring me to his chambers. We will rejoice and be glad for you; we will praise your love more than wine. It is only right that they adore you.
22Sg 1:5 Daughters of Jerusalem, I am dark like the tents of Kedar, yet lovely like the curtains of Solomon.
22Sg 1:6 Do not stare at me because I am dark, for the sun has gazed on me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me a keeper of the vineyards. I have not kept my own vineyard.
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, you, the one I love: Where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you let them rest at noon? Why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?
22Sg 1:8 If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats near the shepherds' tents.
22Sg 1:9 I compare you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22Sg 1:10 Your cheeks are beautiful with jewelry, your neck with its necklace.
22Sg 1:11 We will make gold jewelry for you, accented with silver.
22Sg 1:12 While the king is on his couch, my perfume releases its fragrance.
22Sg 1:13 My love is a sachet of myrrh to me, spending the night between my breasts.
22Sg 1:14 My love is a cluster of henna blossoms to me, in the vineyards of En-gedi.
22Sg 1:15 How beautiful you are, my darling. How very beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
22Sg 1:16 How handsome you are, my love. How delightful! Our bed is lush with foliage;
22Sg 1:17 the beams of our house are cedars, and our rafters are cypresses.
22Sg 2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
22Sg 2:2 Like a lily among thorns, so is my darling among the young women.
22Sg 2:3 Like an apricot tree among the trees of the forest, so is my love among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
22Sg 2:4 He brought me to the banquet hall, and he looked on me with love.
22Sg 2:5 Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apricots, for I am lovesick.
22Sg 2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
22Sg 2:7 Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you, by the gazelles and the wild does of the field: do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.
22Sg 2:8 Listen! My love [is approaching]. Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22Sg 2:9 My love is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, he is standing behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
22Sg 2:10 My love calls to me: Arise, my darling. Come away, my beautiful one.
22Sg 2:11 For now the winter is past; the rain has ended and gone away.
22Sg 2:12 The blossoms appear in the countryside. The time of singing has come, and the turtledove's cooing is heard in our land.
22Sg 2:13 The fig tree ripens its figs; the blossoming vines give off their fragrance. Arise, my darling. Come away, my beautiful one.
22Sg 2:14 My dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22Sg 2:15 Catch the foxes for us-- the little foxes that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyards are in bloom.
22Sg 2:16 My love is mine and I am his; he feeds among the lilies.
22Sg 2:17 Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn [to me], my love, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the divided mountains.
22Sg 3:1 In my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.
22Sg 3:2 I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and the plazas. I will seek the one I love. I sought him, but did not find him.
22Sg 3:3 The guards who go about the city found me. "Have you seen the one I love?" [I asked them].
22Sg 3:4 I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held on to him and would not let him go until I brought him to my mother's house-- to the chamber of the one who conceived me.
22Sg 3:5 Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you, by the gazelles and the wild does of the field: do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.
22Sg 3:6 What is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from every fragrant powder of the merchant?
22Sg 3:7 It is Solomon's royal litter surrounded by 60 warriors from the mighty of Israel.
22Sg 3:8 All of them are skilled with swords and trained in warfare. Each has his sword at his side [to guard] against the terror of the night.
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon made a sedan chair for himself with wood from Lebanon.
22Sg 3:10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, and its seat of purple. Its interior is inlaid with love by the young women of Jerusalem.
22Sg 3:11 Come out, young women of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother placed on him the day of his wedding-- the day of his heart's rejoicing.
22Sg 4:1 How beautiful you are, my darling. How very beautiful! Behind your veil, your eyes are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.
22Sg 4:2 Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn [sheep] coming up from washing, each one having a twin, and not one missing.
22Sg 4:3 Your lips are like a scarlet cord, and your mouth is lovely. Behind your veil, your brow is like a slice of pomegranate.
22Sg 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, constructed in layers. A thousand bucklers are hung on it-- all of them shields of warriors.
22Sg 4:5 Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, that feed among the lilies.
22Sg 4:6 Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.
22Sg 4:7 You are absolutely beautiful, my darling, with no imperfection in you.
22Sg 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride-- with me from Lebanon! Descend from the peak of Amana, from the summit of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.
22Sg 4:9 You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride. You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22Sg 4:10 How delightful your love is, my sister, my bride. Your love is much better than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any balsam.
22Sg 4:11 Your lips drip [sweetness like] the honeycomb, my bride. Honey and milk are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22Sg 4:12 My sister, my bride, [you are] a locked garden-- a locked garden and a sealed spring.
22Sg 4:13 Your branches are a paradise of pomegranates with choicest fruits, henna with nard--
22Sg 4:14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices.
22Sg 4:15 [You are] a garden spring, a well of flowing water streaming from Lebanon.
22Sg 4:16 Awaken, north wind-- come, south wind. Blow on my garden, and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my love come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits.
22Sg 5:1 I have come to my garden-- my sister, my bride. I gather my myrrh with my spices. I eat my honeycomb with my honey. I drink my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, be intoxicated with love!
22Sg 5:2 I sleep, but my heart is awake. A sound! My love is knocking! Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. For my head is drenched with dew, my hair with droplets of the night.
22Sg 5:3 I have taken off my clothing. How can I put it back on? I have washed my feet. How can I get them dirty?
22Sg 5:4 My love thrust his hand through the opening, and my feelings were stirred for him.
22Sg 5:5 I rose to open for my love. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.
22Sg 5:6 I opened to my love, but my love had turned and gone away. I was crushed that he had left. I sought him, but did not find him. I called him, but he did not answer.
22Sg 5:7 The guards who go about the city found me. They beat and wounded me; they took my cloak from me-- the guardians of the walls.
22Sg 5:8 Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you: if you find my love, tell him that I am lovesick.
22Sg 5:9 What makes the one you love better than another, most beautiful of women? What makes him better than another, that you would give us this charge?
22Sg 5:10 My love is fit and strong, notable among ten thousand.
22Sg 5:11 His head is purest gold. His hair is wavy and black as a raven.
22Sg 5:12 His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, washed in milk and set like jewels.
22Sg 5:13 His cheeks are like beds of spice, towers of perfume. His lips are lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.
22Sg 5:14 His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is an ivory panel covered with sapphires.
22Sg 5:15 His legs are alabaster pillars set on pedestals of pure gold. His presence is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars.
22Sg 5:16 His mouth is sweetness. He is absolutely desirable. This is my love, and this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem.
22Sg 6:1 Where has your love gone, most beautiful of women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.
22Sg 6:2 My love has gone down to his garden, to beds of spice, to feed in the gardens and gather lilies.
22Sg 6:3 I am my love's and my love is mine; he feeds among the lilies.
22Sg 6:4 You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, lovely as Jerusalem, awe-inspiring as an army with banners.
22Sg 6:5 Turn your eyes away from me, for they captivate me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.
22Sg 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes coming up from washing, each one having a twin, and not one missing.
22Sg 6:7 Behind your veil, your brow is like a slice of pomegranate.
22Sg 6:8 There are 60 queens and 80 concubines and young women without number.
22Sg 6:9 But my dove, my virtuous one, is unique; she is the favorite of her mother, perfect to the one who gave her birth. Women see her and declare her fortunate; queens and concubines also, and they sing her praises:
22Sg 6:10 Who is thiswho shines like the dawn-- as beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awe-inspiring as an army with banners?
22Sg 6:11 I came down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding and the pomegranates blooming.
22Sg 6:12 Before I knew it, my desire put me [among] the chariots of my noble people.
22Sg 6:13  Come back, come back, Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may look at you! Why are you looking at the Shulammite, as you [look] at the dance of the two camps?
22Sg 7:1 How beautiful are your sandaled feet, princess! The curves of your thighs are like jewelry, the handiwork of a master.
22Sg 7:2 Your navel is a rounded bowl; it never lacks mixed wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat surrounded by lilies.
22Sg 7:3 Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22Sg 7:4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes like pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
22Sg 7:5 Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple cloth-- a king could be held captive in your tresses.
22Sg 7:6 How beautiful you are and how pleasant, [my] love, with such delights!
22Sg 7:7 Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters [of fruit].
22Sg 7:8 I said, "I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, and the fragrance of your breath like apricots.
22Sg 7:9 Your mouth is like fine wine-- flowing smoothly for my love gliding past my lips and teeth!
22Sg 7:10 I belong to my love, and his desire is for me.
22Sg 7:11 Come, my love, let's go to the field; let's spend the night among the henna blossoms.
22Sg 7:12 Let's go early to the vineyards; let's see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love.
22Sg 7:13 The mandrakes give off a fragrance, and at our doors is every delicacy-- new as well as old. I have treasured them up for you, my love.
22Sg 8:1 If only I could treat you like my brother, one who nursed at my mother's breasts, I would find you in public and kiss you, and no one would scorn me.
22Sg 8:2 I would lead you, I would take you, to the house of my mother who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink from my pomegranate juice.
22Sg 8:3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
22Sg 8:4 Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you: do not stir up or awaken love until the appropriate time.
22Sg 8:5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on the one she loves? I awakened you under the apricot tree. There your mother conceived you; there she conceived and gave you birth.
22Sg 8:6 Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death; ardent love is as unrelenting as Sheol. Love's flames are fiery flames-- the fiercest of all.
22Sg 8:7 Mighty waters cannot extinguish love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all his wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.
22Sg 8:8 Our sister is young; she has no breasts. What will we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
22Sg 8:9 If she is a wall, we will build a silver parapet on it. If she is a door, we will enclose it with cedar planks.
22Sg 8:10 I am a wall and my breasts like towers. So in his eyes I have become like one who finds peace.
22Sg 8:11 Solomon owned a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He leased the vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for his fruit 1,000 pieces of silver.
22Sg 8:12 I have my own vineyard. The 1,000 are for you, Solomon, but 200 for those who guard its fruits.
22Sg 8:13 You who dwell in the gardens-- companions are listening for your voice-- let me hear you!
22Sg 8:14 Hurry [to me], my love, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
23
23Is 1:1 The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reignsof Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23Is 1:2 Listen, heavens, and pay attention, earth, for the LORD has spoken: "I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against Me.
23Is 1:3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's feeding-trough, [but] Israel does not know; My people do not understand."
23Is 1:4 Oh-- sinful nation, people weighed down with iniquity, brood of evildoers, depraved children! They have abandoned the LORD; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; they have turned their backs [on Him].
23Is 1:5 Why do you want more beatings? Why do you keep on rebelling? The whole head is hurt, and the whole heart is sick.
23Is 1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head, no spot is uninjured-- wounds, welts, and festering sores not cleansed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.
23Is 1:7 Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire; before your very eyes foreigners devour your fields-- a desolation overthrown by foreigners.
23Is 1:8 Daughter Zion is abandoned like a shelter in a vineyard, like a shack in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
23Is 1:9 If the LORD of Hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would be like Sodom, we would resemble Gomorrah.
23Is 1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23Is 1:11 "What are all your sacrifices to Me?" asks the LORD. "I have had enough of burnt offerings and rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; I have no desire for the blood of bulls, lambs, or male goats.
23Is 1:12 When you come to appear before Me, who requires this from you-- [this] trampling of My courts?
23Is 1:13 Stop bringing useless offerings. I despise [your] incense. New Moons and Sabbaths, and the calling of solemn assemblies-- I cannot stand iniquity with a festival.
23Is 1:14 I hate your New Moons and prescribed festivals. They have become a burden to Me; I am tired of putting up with [them].
23Is 1:15 When you lift up your hands [in prayer], I will refuse to look at you; even if you offer countless prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
23Is 1:16 "Wash yourselves. Cleanse yourselves. Remove your evil deeds from My sight. Stop doing evil.
23Is 1:17 Learn to do what is good. Seek justice. Correct the oppressor. Defend the rights of the fatherless. Plead the widow's cause.
23Is 1:18 "Come, let us discuss this," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they are as red as crimson, they will be like wool.
23Is 1:19 If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land.
23Is 1:20 But if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23Is 1:21 The faithful city-- what an adulteress she has become! She was once full of justice. Righteousness once dwelt in her-- but now, murderers!
23Is 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your beer is diluted with water.
23Is 1:23 Your rulers are rebels, friends of thieves. They all love graft and chase after bribes. They do not defend the rights of the fatherless, and the widow's case never comes before them."
23Is 1:24 Therefore the Lord God of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: "Ah, I will gain satisfaction against My foes; I will take revenge against My enemies.
23Is 1:25 I will turn My hand against you and will burn away your dross completely; I will remove all your impurities.
23Is 1:26 I will restore your judges to what they once were, and your advisers to their former state. Afterwards you will be called the Righteous City, a Faithful City."
23Is 1:27 Zion will be redeemed by justice, her repentant ones by righteousness.
23Is 1:28 But both rebels and sinners will be destroyed, and those who abandon the LORD will perish.
23Is 1:29 Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred trees you desired, and you will be embarrassed because of the gardens you have chosen.
23Is 1:30 For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered, and like a garden without water.
23Is 1:31 The strong one will become tinder, and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench [the flames].
23Is 2:1 The vision that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
23Is 2:2 In the last days the mountain of the LORD's house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. All nations will stream to it,
23Is 2:3 and many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about His ways so that we may walk in His paths." For instruction will go out of Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23Is 2:4 He will settle disputes among the nations and provide arbitration for many peoples. They will turn their swords into plows and their spears into pruning knives. Nations will not take up the sword against [other] nations, and they will never again train for war.
23Is 2:5 House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the LORD's light.
23Is 2:6 For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of [ divination] from the East and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines. They are in league with foreigners.
23Is 2:7 Their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no limit to their treasures; their land is full of horses, and there is no limit to their chariots.
23Is 2:8 Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
23Is 2:9 So humanity is brought low, and man is humbled. Do not forgive them!
23Is 2:10 Go into the rocks and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD and from His majestic splendor.
23Is 2:11 Human pride will be humbled, and the loftiness of men will be brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted on that day.
23Is 2:12 For a day belonging to the LORD of Hosts is [coming] against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up-- it will be humbled--
23Is 2:13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan,
23Is 2:14 against all the high mountains, against all the lofty hills,
23Is 2:15 against every high tower, against every fortified wall,
23Is 2:16 against every ship of Tarshish, and against every splendid sea vessel.
23Is 2:17 So human pride will be brought low, and the loftiness of men will be humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted on that day.
23Is 2:18 The idols will vanish completely.
23Is 2:19 People will go into caves in the rocks and holes in the ground, away from the terror of the LORD and from His majestic splendor, when He rises to terrify the earth.
23Is 2:20 On that day people will throw their silver and gold idols, which they made to worship, to the moles and the bats.
23Is 2:21 They will go into the caves of the rocks and the crevices in the cliffs, away from the terror of the LORD and from His majestic splendor, when He rises to terrify the earth.
23Is 2:22 Put no more trust in man, who has only the breath in his nostrils. What is he really worth?
23Is 3:1 Observe this: The Lord God of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and from Judah every kind of security: the entire supply of bread and water,
23Is 3:2 the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the fortune-teller and elder,
23Is 3:3 the commander of 50 and the dignitary, the counselor, cunning magician, and necromancer.
23Is 3:4 "I will make youths their leaders, and the unstable will govern them."
23Is 3:5 The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the youth will act arrogantly toward the elder, and the worthless toward the honorable.
23Is 3:6 A man will even seize his brother in his father's house, [saying:] "You have a cloak-- you be our leader! This heap of rubble will be under your control."
23Is 3:7 On that day he will cry out, saying: "I'm not a healer. I don't even have food or clothing in my house. Don't make me the leader of the people!"
23Is 3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they have spoken and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence.
23Is 3:9 The look on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom, they flaunt their sin. They do not conceal it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
23Is 3:10 Tell the righteous that it will go well [for them], for they will eat the fruit of their deeds.
23Is 3:11 Woe to the wicked-- [it will go] badly [for them], for what they have done will be done to them.
23Is 3:12 Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. My people, your leaders mislead you; they confuse the direction of your paths.
23Is 3:13 The LORD rises to argue the case and stands to judge the people.
23Is 3:14 The LORD brings [this] charge against the elders and leaders of His people: "You have devastated the vineyard. The plunder from the poor is in your houses.
23Is 3:15 Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?" says the Lord God of Hosts.
23Is 3:16 The LORD also says: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, walking with heads held high and seductive eyes, going along with prancing steps, jingling their ankle bracelets,
23Is 3:17 the Lord will put scabs on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will shave their foreheads bare.
23Is 3:18 On that day the Lord will strip their finery: ankle bracelets, headbands, crescents,
23Is 3:19 pendants, bracelets, veils,
23Is 3:20 headdresses, ankle jewelry, sashes, perfume bottles, amulets,
23Is 3:21 signet rings, nose rings,
23Is 3:22 festive robes, capes, cloaks, purses,
23Is 3:23 garments, linen clothes, turbans, and veils.
23Is 3:24 Instead of perfume there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of beautifully styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothes, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.
23Is 3:25 Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.
23Is 3:26 Then her gates will lament and mourn; deserted, she will sit on the ground.
23Is 4:1 On that day seven women will seize one man, saying, "We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace."
23Is 4:2 On that day the branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel's survivors.
23Is 4:3 Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy-- all in Jerusalem who are destined to live--
23Is 4:4 when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodguilt from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning.
23Is 4:5 Then the LORD will create a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night over the entire site of Mount Zion and over its assemblies. For there will be a canopy over all the glory,
23Is 4:6 and there will be a booth for shade from heat by day, and a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.
23Is 5:1 I will sing about the one I love, a song about my loved one's vineyard: The one I love had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
23Is 5:2 He broke up the soil, cleared it of stones, and planted it with the finest vines. He built a tower in the middle of it and even hewed out a winepress there. He expected it to yield good grapes, but it yielded worthless grapes.
23Is 5:3 So now, residents of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.
23Is 5:4 What more could I have done for My vineyard than I did? Why, when I expected a yield of good grapes, did it yield worthless grapes?
23Is 5:5 Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will tear down its wall, and it will be trampled.
23Is 5:6 I will make it a wasteland. It will not be pruned or weeded; thorns and briers will grow up. I will also give orders to the clouds that rain should not fall on it.
23Is 5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah, the plant He delighted in. He looked for justice but saw injustice, for righteousness, but heard cries of wretchedness.
23Is 5:8 Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field until there is no more room and you alone are left in the land.
23Is 5:9 In my hearing the LORD of Hosts [has taken an oath]: Indeed, many houses will become desolate, grand and lovely ones without inhabitants.
23Is 5:10 For a ten-acre vineyard will yield only six gallons, and 10 bushels of seed will yield only [one] bushel.
23Is 5:11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning in pursuit of beer, who linger into the evening, inflamed by wine.
23Is 5:12 At their feasts they have lyre, harp, tambourine, flute, and wine. They do not perceive the LORD's actions, and they do not see the work of His hands.
23Is 5:13 Therefore My people go into exile because they lack knowledge; the dignitaries are starving, and the masses are parched with thirst.
23Is 5:14 Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat and opens wide its enormous jaws, and down go Zion's dignitaries, her masses, her crowds, and those who carouse in her!
23Is 5:15 Humanity is brought low, man is humbled, and haughty eyes are humbled.
23Is 5:16 But the LORD of Hosts is exalted by His justice, and the holy God is distinguished by righteousness.
23Is 5:17 Lambs will graze as [if in] their own pastures, and strangers will eat [among] the ruins of the rich.
23Is 5:18 Woe to those who drag wickedness with cords of deceit and [pull] sin along with cart ropes,
23Is 5:19 to those who say: "Let Him hurry up and do His work quickly so that we can see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take place so that we can know it!"
23Is 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
23Is 5:21 Woe to those who are wise in their own opinion and clever in their own sight.
23Is 5:22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, who are fearless at mixing beer,
23Is 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe and deprive the innocent of justice.
23Is 5:24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes straw and as dry grass shrivels in the flame, so their roots will become like something rotten and their blossoms will blow away like dust, for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts, and they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 5:25 Therefore the LORD's anger burns against His people. He raised His hand against them and struck them; the mountains quaked, and their corpses were like garbage in the streets. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised [to strike].
23Is 5:26 He raises a signal flag for the distant nations and whistles for them from the ends of the earth. Look-- how quickly and swiftly they come!
23Is 5:27 None of them grows weary or stumbles; no one slumbers or sleeps. No belt is loose, and no sandal strap broken.
23Is 5:28 Their arrows are sharpened, and all their bows strung. Their horses' hooves are like flint; their [chariot] wheels are like a whirlwind.
23Is 5:29 Their roaring is like a lion's; they roar like young lions; they growl and seize their prey and carry [it] off, and no one can rescue [it].
23Is 5:30 On that day they will roar over it, like the roaring of the sea. When one looks at the land, there will be darkness and distress; light will be obscured by clouds.
23Is 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and His robe filled the temple.
23Is 6:2 Seraphim were standing above Him; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
23Is 6:3 And one called to another: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; His glory fills the whole earth.
23Is 6:4 The foundations of the doorways shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke.
23Is 6:5 Then I said: Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips, [and] because my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs.
23Is 6:7 He touched my mouth [with it] and said: Now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, and your sin is atoned for.
23Is 6:8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: Who should I send? Who will go for Us? I said: Here I am. Send me.
23Is 6:9 And He replied: Go! Say to these people: Keep listening, but do not understand; keep looking, but do not perceive.
23Is 6:10 Dull the minds of these people; deafen their ears and blind their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed.
23Is 6:11 Then I said, "Until when, Lord?" And He replied: Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants, houses are without people, the land is ruined and desolate,
23Is 6:12 and the LORD drives the people far away, leaving great emptiness in the land.
23Is 6:13 Though a tenth will remain in the land, it will be burned again. Like the terebinth or the oak, which leaves a stump when felled, the holy seed is the stump.
23Is 7:1 This took place during the reign of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah: Rezin king of Aram, along with Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, waged war against Jerusalem, but he could not succeed.
23Is 7:2 When it became known to the house of David that Aram had occupied Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz and the hearts of his people trembled like trees of a forest shaking in a wind.
23Is 7:3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to the Fuller's Field.
23Is 7:4 Say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Don't be afraid or fainthearted because of these two smoldering stubs of firebrands, Rezin of Aram, and the son of Remaliah.
23Is 7:5 For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted harm against you. They say:
23Is 7:6 Let us go up against Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it for ourselves. Then we can install Tabeel's son as king in it."
23Is 7:7 This is what the Lord God says: It will not happen; it will not occur.
23Is 7:8 The head of Aram is Damascus, the head of Damascus is Rezin (within 65 years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people),
23Is 7:9 the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, then you will not stand at all.
23Is 7:10 Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz:
23Is 7:11 "Ask for a sign from the LORD your God-- from the depths of Sheol to the heights of heaven."
23Is 7:12 But Ahaz replied, "I will not ask. I will not test the LORD."
23Is 7:13 Isaiah said, "Listen, house of David! Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men? Will you also try the patience of my God?
23Is 7:14 Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel.
23Is 7:15 By the time he learns to reject what is bad and choose what is good, he will be eating butter and honey.
23Is 7:16 For before the boy knows to reject what is bad and choose what is good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned.
23Is 7:17 The LORD will bring on you, your people, and the house of your father, such a time as has never been since Ephraim separated from Judah-- the king of Assyria [is coming].
23Is 7:18 On that day the LORD will whistle to the fly that is at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
23Is 7:19 All of them will come and settle in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes, and in all the water holes.
23Is 7:20 On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River-- the king of Assyria-- to shave the head, the hair on the legs, and to remove the beard as well.
23Is 7:21 On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
23Is 7:22 and from the abundant milk they give he will eat butter, for every survivor in the land will eat butter and honey.
23Is 7:23 And on that day every place where there were 1,000 vines, worth 1,000 pieces of silver, will become thorns and briers.
23Is 7:24 A man will go there with bow and arrows because the whole land will be thorns and briers.
23Is 7:25 You will not go to all the hills that were once tilled with a hoe, for fear of the thorns and briers. [Those hills] will be places for oxen to graze and for sheep to trample.
23Is 8:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Take a large piece of parchment and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
23Is 8:2 I have appointed trustworthy witnesses-- Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah."
23Is 8:3 I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
23Is 8:4 for before the boy knows how to call out father or mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried off to the king of Assyria."
23Is 8:5 The LORD spoke to me again:
23Is 8:6 Because these people rejected the slowly flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoiced with Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
23Is 8:7 the Lord will certainly bring against them the mighty rushing waters of the Euphrates River-- the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its channels and spill over all its banks.
23Is 8:8 It will pour into Judah, flood over it, and sweep through, reaching up to the neck; and its spreading streams will fill your entire land, Immanuel!
23Is 8:9 Band together, peoples, and be broken; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for war, and be broken; prepare for war, and be broken.
23Is 8:10 Devise a plan; it will fail. Make a prediction; it will not happen. For God is with us.
23Is 8:11 For this is what the LORD said to me with great power, to keep me from going the way of this people:
23Is 8:12 Do not call everything an alliance these people say is an alliance. Do not fear what they fear; do not be terrified.
23Is 8:13 You are to regard only the LORD of Hosts as holy. Only He should be feared; only He should be held in awe.
23Is 8:14 He will be a sanctuary; but for the two houses of Israel, He will be a stone to stumble over and a rock to trip over, and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
23Is 8:15 Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be snared and captured.
23Is 8:16 Bind up the testimony. Seal up the instruction among my disciples.
23Is 8:17 I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will wait for Him.
23Is 8:18 Here I am with the children the LORD has given me to be signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of Hosts who dwells on Mount Zion.
23Is 8:19 When they say to you, "Consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who chirp and mutter," shouldn't a people consult their God? [Should they consult] the dead on behalf of the living?
23Is 8:20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, there will be no dawn for them.
23Is 8:21 They will wander through the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged, and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.
23Is 8:22 They will look toward the earth and see only distress, darkness, and the gloom of affliction, and they will be driven into thick darkness.
23Is 9:1  Nevertheless, the gloom of the distressed land will not be like that of the former times when He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the future He will bring honor to the Way of the Sea, to the land east of the Jordan, and to Galilee of the nations.
23Is 9:2  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of darkness, a light has dawned.
23Is 9:3 You have enlarged the nation and increased its joy. [The people] have rejoiced before You as they rejoice at harvest time and as they rejoice when dividing spoils.
23Is 9:4 For You have shattered their burdensome yoke and the rod on their shoulders, the staff of their oppressor, just as [You did] on the day of Midian.
23Is 9:5 For the trampling boot of battle and the bloodied garments of war will be burned as fuel for the fire.
23Is 9:6 For a child will be born for us, a son will be given to us, and the government will be on His shoulders. He will be named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
23Is 9:7 The dominion will be vast, and its prosperity will never end. He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness from now on and forever. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
23Is 9:8 The Lord sent a message against Jacob; it came against Israel.
23Is 9:9 All the people-- Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria-- will know it. They will say with pride and arrogance:
23Is 9:10 "The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with cut stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars."
23Is 9:11 The LORD has raised up Rezin's adversaries against him and stirred up his enemies.
23Is 9:12 Aram from the east and Philistia from the west have consumed Israel with open mouths. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised [to strike].
23Is 9:13 The people did not turn to Him who struck them; they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 9:14 So the LORD cut off Israel's head and tail, palm branch and reed in a single day.
23Is 9:15 The head is the elder, the honored one; the tail is the prophet, the lying teacher.
23Is 9:16 The leaders of the people mislead [them], and those they mislead are swallowed up.
23Is 9:17 Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over Israel's young men and has no compassion on its fatherless and widows, for everyone is a godless evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised [to strike].
23Is 9:18 For wickedness burns like a fire that consumes thorns and briers and kindles the forest thickets so that they go up in a column of smoke.
23Is 9:19 The land is scorched by the wrath of the LORD of Hosts, and the people are like fuel for the fire. No one has compassion on his brother.
23Is 9:20 They carve [meat] on the right, but they are [still] hungry; they have eaten on the left, but they are [still] not satisfied. Each one eats the flesh of his own arm.
23Is 9:21 Manasseh is with Ephraim, and Ephraim with Manasseh; together, both are against Judah. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised [to strike].
23Is 10:1 Woe to those enacting crooked statutes and writing oppressive laws
23Is 10:2 to keep the poor from getting a fair trial and to deprive the afflicted among my people of justice, so that widows can be their spoil and they can plunder the fatherless.
23Is 10:3 What will you do on the day of punishment when devastation comes from far away? Who will you run to for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
23Is 10:4 [There will be nothing to do] except crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised [to strike].
23Is 10:5 Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger-- the staff in their hands is My wrath.
23Is 10:6 I will send him against a godless nation; I will command him [to go] against a people destined for My rage, to take spoils, to plunder, and to trample them down like clay in the streets.
23Is 10:7 But this is not what he intends; this is not what he plans. It is his intent to destroy and to cut off many nations.
23Is 10:8 For he says: Aren't all my commanders kings?
23Is 10:9 Isn't Calno like Carchemish? Isn't Hamath like Arpad? Isn't Samaria like Damascus?
23Is 10:10 As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms, whose idols exceeded those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
23Is 10:11 and as I did to Samaria and its idols will I not also do to Jerusalem and its idols?
23Is 10:12 But when the Lord finishes all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, [He will say,] "I will punish the king of Assyria for his arrogant acts and the proud look in his eyes."
23Is 10:13 For he said: I have done [this] by my own strength and wisdom, for I am clever. I abolished the borders of nations and plundered their treasures; like a mighty warrior, I subjugated the inhabitants.
23Is 10:14 My hand has reached out, as if into a nest, to seize the wealth of the nations. Like one gathering abandoned eggs, I gathered the whole earth. No wing fluttered; no beak opened or chirped.
23Is 10:15 Does an ax exalt itself above the one who chops with it? Does a saw magnify itself above the one who saws with it? As if a staff could wave those who lift it! As if a rod could lift what isn't wood!
23Is 10:16 Therefore the Lord God of Hosts will inflict an emaciating disease on the well-fed of Assyria, and He will kindle a burning fire under its glory.
23Is 10:17 Israel's Light will become a fire, and its Holy One, a flame. In one day it will burn up Assyria's thorns and thistles.
23Is 10:18 He will completely destroy the glory of its forests and orchards as a sickness consumes a person.
23Is 10:19 The remaining trees of its forest will be so few in number that a child could count them.
23Is 10:20 On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on the one who struck them, but they will faithfully depend on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 10:21 The remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.
23Is 10:22 Israel, even if your people were as numerous as the sand of the sea, [only] a remnant of them will return. Destruction has been decreed; justice overflows.
23Is 10:23 For throughout the land the Lord God of Hosts is carrying out a destruction that was decreed.
23Is 10:24 Therefore, the Lord God of Hosts says this: "My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria, though he strikes you with a rod and raises his staff over you as the Egyptians did.
23Is 10:25 In just a little while My wrath will be spent and My anger will turn to their destruction."
23Is 10:26 And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against him as [He did when He] struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; and He will raise His staff over the sea as [He did] in Egypt.
23Is 10:27 On that day his burden will fall from your shoulders, and his yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because of [his] fatness.
23Is 10:28 Assyria has come to Aiath and has gone through Migron, storing his equipment at Michmash.
23Is 10:29 They crossed over at the ford, saying, "We will spend the night at Geba." The people of Ramah are trembling; those at Gibeah of Saul have fled.
23Is 10:30 Cry aloud, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! Anathoth is miserable.
23Is 10:31 Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
23Is 10:32 Today he will stand at Nob, shaking his fist at the mountain of Daughter Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
23Is 10:33 Look, the Lord God of Hosts will chop off the branches with terrifying power, and the tall [trees] will be cut down, the high [trees] felled.
23Is 10:34 He is clearing the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon with its majesty will fall.
23Is 11:1 Then a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
23Is 11:2 The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him-- a Spirit of wisdom and understanding, a Spirit of counsel and strength, a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.
23Is 11:3 His delight will be in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what He sees with His eyes, He will not execute justice by what He hears with His ears,
23Is 11:4 but He will judge the poor righteously and execute justice for the oppressed of the land. He will strike the land with discipline from His mouth, and He will kill the wicked with a command from His lips.
23Is 11:5 Righteousness and faithfulness will be a belt around His waist.
23Is 11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat. The calf, the young lion, and the fatling will be together, and a child will lead them.
23Is 11:7 The cow and the bear will graze, their young ones will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like an ox.
23Is 11:8 An infant will play beside the cobra's pit, and a toddler will put his hand into a snake's den.
23Is 11:9 No one will harm or destroy on My entire holy mountain, for the land will be as full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is filled with water.
23Is 11:10 On that day the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek Him, and His resting place will be glorious.
23Is 11:11 On that day the Lord will [extend] His hand a second time to recover-- from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coasts and islands of the west-- the remnant of His people who survive.
23Is 11:12 He will lift up a banner for the nations and gather the dispersed of Israel; He will collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
23Is 11:13 Ephraim's envy will cease; Judah's harassment will end. Ephraim will no longer be envious of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim.
23Is 11:14 But they will swoop down on the Philistine flank to the west. Together they will plunder the people of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be their subjects.
23Is 11:15 The LORD will divide the Gulf of Suez. He will wave His hand over the Euphrates with His mighty wind and will split it into seven streams, letting people walk through on foot.
23Is 11:16 There will be a highway for the remnant of His people who will survive from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
23Is 12:1 On that day you will say: "I will praise You, LORD, although You were angry with me. Your anger has turned away, and You have had compassion on me.
23Is 12:2 Indeed, God is my salvation. I will trust [Him] and not be afraid. Because Yah, the LORD, is my strength and my song, He has become my salvation."
23Is 12:3 You will joyfully draw water from the springs of salvation,
23Is 12:4 and on that day you will say: "Give thanks to the LORD; proclaim His name! Celebrate His deeds among the peoples. Declare that His name is exalted.
23Is 12:5 Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known throughout the earth.
23Is 12:6 Cry out and sing, citizen of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is among you in [His] greatness."
23Is 13:1 An oracle against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
23Is 13:2 Lift up a banner on a barren mountain. Call out to them. Wave your hand, and they will go through the gates of the nobles.
23Is 13:3 I have commanded My chosen ones; I have also called My warriors, who exult in My triumph, to execute My wrath.
23Is 13:4 Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a mighty people! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations being gathered together! The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing an army for war.
23Is 13:5 They are coming from a far land, from the distant horizon-- the LORD and the weapons of His wrath-- to destroy the whole country.
23Is 13:6 Wail! For the day of the LORD is near. It will come like destruction from the Almighty.
23Is 13:7 Therefore everyone's hands will become weak, and every man's heart will melt.
23Is 13:8 They will be horrified; pain and agony will seize [them]; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look at each other, their faces flushed with fear.
23Is 13:9 Look, the day of the LORD is coming-- cruel, with rage and burning anger-- to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners on it.
23Is 13:10 Indeed, the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give their light. The sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will not shine.
23Is 13:11 I will bring disaster on the world, and their [own] iniquity, on the wicked. I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant and humiliate the insolence of tyrants.
23Is 13:12 I will make man scarcer than gold, and mankind more rare than the gold of Ophir.
23Is 13:13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will shake from its foundations at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts, on the day of His burning anger.
23Is 13:14 Like wandering gazelles and like sheep without a shepherd, each one will turn to his own people, each one will flee to his own land.
23Is 13:15 Whoever is found will be stabbed, and whoever is caught will die by the sword.
23Is 13:16 Their children will be smashed [to death] before their eyes; their houses will be looted, and their wives raped.
23Is 13:17 Look! I am stirring up the Medes against them, who cannot be bought off with silver and who have no desire for gold.
23Is 13:18 [Their] bows will cut young men to pieces. They will have no compassion on little ones; they will not look with pity on children.
23Is 13:19 And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.
23Is 13:20 It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; a nomad will not pitch his tent there, and shepherds will not let [their flocks] rest there.
23Is 13:21 But wild animals will lie down there, and owls will fill the houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.
23Is 13:22 Hyenas will howl in the fortresses, and jackals, in the luxurious palaces. Babylon's time is almost up; her days are almost over.
23Is 14:1 For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will choose Israel again. He will settle them on their own land. The foreigner will join them and be united with the house of Jacob.
23Is 14:2 The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. Then the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves in the LORD's land. They will make captives of their captors and will rule over their oppressors.
23Is 14:3 When the LORD gives you rest from your pain, torment, and the hard labor you were forced to do,
23Is 14:4 you will sing this song [of contempt] about the king of Babylon and say: How the oppressor has quieted down, and how the raging has become quiet!
23Is 14:5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers.
23Is 14:6 It struck the peoples in anger with unceasing blows. It subdued the nations in rage with relentless persecution.
23Is 14:7 All the earth is calm and at rest; people shout with a ringing cry.
23Is 14:8 Even the cypresses and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice over you: "Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter has come against us."
23Is 14:9 Sheol below is eager to greet your coming. He stirs up the spirits of the departed for you-- all the rulers of the earth. He makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.
23Is 14:10 They all respond to you, saying: "You too have become as weak as we are; you have become like us!
23Is 14:11 Your splendor has been brought down to Sheol, [along with] the music of your harps. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you."
23Is 14:12 Shining morning star, how you have fallen from the heavens! You destroyer of nations, you have been cut down to the ground.
23Is 14:13 You said to yourself: "I will ascend to the heavens; I will set up my throne above the stars of God. I will sit on the mount of the [gods'] assembly, in the remotest parts of the North.
23Is 14:14 I will ascend above the highest clouds; I will make myself like the Most High."
23Is 14:15 But you will be brought down to Sheol into the deepest regions of the Pit.
23Is 14:16 Those who see you will stare at you; they will look closely at you: "Is this the man who caused the earth to tremble, who shook the kingdoms,
23Is 14:17 who turned the world into a wilderness, who trampled its cities and would not release the prisoners to return home?"
23Is 14:18 All the kings of the nations lie in splendor, each in his own tomb.
23Is 14:19 But you are thrown out without a grave, like a worthless branch, covered by those slain with the sword and dumped into a rocky pit like a trampled corpse.
23Is 14:20 You will not join them in burial, because you destroyed your land and slaughtered your own people. The offspring of evildoers will never be remembered.
23Is 14:21 Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons, because of the iniquity of their fathers. They never rise up to possess a land or fill the surface of the earth with cities.
23Is 14:22 "I will rise up against them"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "and I will cut off from Babylon her reputation, remnant, offspring, and posterity"-- the LORD's declaration.
23Is 14:23 "I will make her a swampland and a region for wild animals, and I will sweep her away with a broom of destruction." [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 14:24 The LORD of Hosts has sworn: As I have planned, so it will be; as I have purposed it, so it will happen.
23Is 14:25 I will break Assyria in My land; I will tread him down on My mountain. Then his yoke will be taken from them, and his burden will be removed from their shoulders.
23Is 14:26 This is the plan prepared for the whole earth, and this is the hand stretched out against all the nations.
23Is 14:27 The LORD of Hosts Himself has planned it; therefore, who can stand in its way? It is His hand that is outstretched, so who can turn it back?
23Is 14:28 In the year that King Ahaz died, this oracle came:
23Is 14:29 Don't rejoice, all of you [in] Philistia, because the rod of the one who struck you is broken. For a viper will come out of the root of a snake, and from its egg comes a flying serpent.
23Is 14:30 Then the firstborn of the poor will be well fed, and the impoverished will lie down in safety, but I will kill your root with hunger, and your remnant will be slain.
23Is 14:31 Wail, you gates! Cry out, city! Tremble with fear, all Philistia! For a cloud of dust is coming from the north, and there is no one missing from [the invader's] ranks.
23Is 14:32 What answer will be given to the messengers from that nation? The LORD has founded Zion, and His afflicted people find refuge in her.
23Is 15:1 An oracle against Moab: Ar in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night. Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night.
23Is 15:2 Dibon went up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails on Nebo and at Medeba. Every head is shaved; every beard is cut off.
23Is 15:3 In its streets they wear sackcloth; on its rooftops and in its public squares everyone wails, falling down and weeping.
23Is 15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out, and they tremble.
23Is 15:5 My heart cries out over Moab, whose fugitives [flee] as far as Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah; they go up the slope of Luhith weeping; they raise a cry of destruction on the road to Horonaim.
23Is 15:6 The waters of Nimrim are desolate; the grass is withered, the foliage is gone, and the vegetation has vanished.
23Is 15:7 So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Wadi of the Willows.
23Is 15:8 For their cry echoes throughout the territory of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; their wailing reaches Beer-elim.
23Is 15:9 The waters of Dibon are full of blood, but I will bring on Dibon even more [than this]-- a lion for those who escape from Moab, and for the survivors in the land.
23Is 16:1 Send lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela in the desert to the mountain of Daughter Zion.
23Is 16:2 Like a bird fleeing, forced from the nest, the daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon.
23Is 16:3 Give us counsel and make a decision. [Shelter us] at noonday with shade that is as dark as night. Hide the refugee; do not betray the one who flees.
23Is 16:4 Let my refugees stay with you; be a refuge for Moab from the aggressor. When the oppressor has gone, destruction has ended, and marauders have vanished from the land.
23Is 16:5 Then in the tent of David a throne will be established by faithful love. A judge who seeks what is right and is quick to execute justice will sit on the throne forever.
23Is 16:6 We have heard of Moab's pride-- how very proud he is-- his haughtiness, his pride, his arrogance, and his empty boasting.
23Is 16:7 Therefore let Moab wail; let every one of them wail for Moab. Mourn, you who are completely devastated, for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth.
23Is 16:8 For Heshbon's terraced vineyards and the grapevines of Sibmah have withered. The rulers of the nations have trampled its choice vines that reached as far as Jazer and spread to the desert. Their shoots spread out and reached the Dead Sea.
23Is 16:9 So I join with Jazer to weep for the vines of Sibmah; I drench Heshbon and Elealeh with my tears. Triumphant shouts have fallen silent over your summer [fruit] and your harvest.
23Is 16:10 Joy and rejoicing have been removed from the orchard; no one is singing or shouting for joy in the vineyards. No one tramples grapes in the winepresses. I have put an end to the shouting.
23Is 16:11 Therefore I moan like [the sound of] a lyre for Moab, [as does] my innermost being for Kir-heres.
23Is 16:12 When Moab appears on the high place, when he tires himself out and comes to his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good.
23Is 16:13 This is the message that the LORD previously announced about Moab.
23Is 16:14 And now the LORD says, "In three years, as a hired worker counts years, Moab's splendor will become an object of contempt, in spite of a very large population. And those who are left will be few and weak."
23Is 17:1 An oracle against Damascus: Look, Damascus is no longer a city. It has become a ruined heap.
23Is 17:2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they will be [places] for flocks. They will lie down without fear.
23Is 17:3 The fortress disappears from Ephraim, and a kingdom from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the splendor of the Israelites. [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 17:4 On that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, and his healthy body will become emaciated.
23Is 17:5 It will be as if a reaper had gathered standing grain-- his arm harvesting the heads of grain-- and as if one had gleaned heads of grain in the valley of Rephaim.
23Is 17:6 Only gleanings will be left in Israel, as if an olive tree had been beaten-- two or three berries at the very top of the tree, four or five on its fruitful branches. [This is] the declaration of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23Is 17:7 On that day people will look to their Maker and will turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 17:8 They will not look to the altars they made with their hands or to the Asherahs and incense altars they made with their fingers.
23Is 17:9 On that day their strong cities will be like the abandoned woods and mountaintops that were abandoned because of the Israelites; there will be desolation.
23Is 17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and you have failed to remember the rock of your strength; therefore you will plant beautiful plants and set out cuttings from exotic vines.
23Is 17:11 On the day that you plant, you will help them to grow, and in the morning you will help your seed to sprout, [but] the harvest will vanish on the day of disease and incurable pain.
23Is 17:12 Ah! The roar of many peoples-- they roar like the roaring of the seas. The raging of the nations-- they rage like the raging of mighty waters.
23Is 17:13 The nations rage like the raging of many waters. He rebukes them, and they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills and like dead thistles before a gale.
23Is 17:14 In the evening-- sudden terror! Before morning-- it is gone! This is the fate of those who plunder us and the lot of those who ravage us.
23Is 18:1 Ah! The land of buzzing insect wings beyond the rivers of Cush
23Is 18:2 sends envoys by sea, in reed vessels on the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared near and far, a powerful nation with a strange language, whose land is divided by rivers.
23Is 18:3 All you inhabitants of the world and you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, look! When a trumpet sounds, listen!
23Is 18:4 For, the LORD said to me: I will quietly look out from My place, like shimmering heat in sunshine, like a rain cloud in harvest heat.
23Is 18:5 For before the harvest, when the blossoming is over and the blossom becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with a pruning knife, and tear away and remove the branches.
23Is 18:6 They will all be left for the birds of prey on the hills and for the wild animals of the land. The birds will spend the summer on them, and all the animals, the winter on them.
23Is 18:7 At that time a gift will be brought to the LORD of Hosts from a people tall and smooth-skinned, a people feared near and far, a powerful nation with a strange language, whose land is divided by rivers-- to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 19:1 An oracle against Egypt: Look, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. Egypt's idols will tremble before Him, and Egypt's heart will melt within it.
23Is 19:2 I will provoke Egypt against Egypt; each will fight against his brother and each against his friend, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
23Is 19:3 Egypt's spirit will be disturbed within it, and I will frustrate its plans. Then they will seek idols, ghosts, spirits of the dead, and spiritists.
23Is 19:4 I will deliver Egypt into the hands of harsh masters, and a strong king will rule it. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts.
23Is 19:5 The waters of the sea will dry up, and the river will be parched and dry.
23Is 19:6 The channels will stink; they will dwindle, and Egypt's canals will be parched. Reed and rush will die.
23Is 19:7 The reeds by the Nile, by the mouth of the river, and all the cultivated areas of the Nile will wither, blow away, and vanish.
23Is 19:8 Then the fishermen will mourn. All those who cast hooks into the Nile will lament, and those who spread nets on the water will shrivel up.
23Is 19:9 Those who work with flax will be dismayed; the combers and weavers will turn pale.
23Is 19:10 [Egypt's] weavers will be dejected; all her wage earners will be demoralized.
23Is 19:11 The princes of Zoan are complete fools; Pharaoh's wisest advisers give stupid advice! How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise, a student of eastern kings."
23Is 19:12 Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you and reveal what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.
23Is 19:13 The princes of Zoan have been fools; the princes of Memphis are deceived. Her tribal chieftains have led Egypt astray.
23Is 19:14 The LORD has mixed within her a spirit of confusion. [The leaders] have made Egypt stagger in all she does, as a drunkard staggers in his vomit.
23Is 19:15 No head or tail, palm or reed, will be able to do anything for Egypt.
23Is 19:16 On that day Egypt will be like women. She will tremble with fear because of the threatening hand of the LORD of Hosts when He raises it against her.
23Is 19:17 The land of Judah will terrify Egypt; whenever Judah is mentioned, Egypt will tremble because of what the LORD of Hosts has planned against it.
23Is 19:18 On that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear loyalty to the LORD of Hosts. One of the cities will be called the City of the Sun.
23Is 19:19 On that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the center of the land of Egypt and a pillar to the LORD near her border.
23Is 19:20 It will be a sign and witness to the LORD of Hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, He will send them a savior and leader, and he will rescue them.
23Is 19:21 The LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and Egypt will know the LORD on that day. They will offer sacrifices and offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and fulfill them.
23Is 19:22 The LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing. Then they will return to the LORD and He will hear their prayers and heal them.
23Is 19:23 On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. Assyria will go to Egypt, Egypt to Assyria, and Egypt will worship with Assyria.
23Is 19:24 On that day Israel will form a triple [alliance] with Egypt and Assyria-- a blessing within the land.
23Is 19:25 The LORD of Hosts will bless them, saying, "Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance."
23Is 20:1 In the year that the commander-in-chief, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it--
23Is 20:2 during that time the LORD had spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, "Go, take off your sackcloth and remove the sandals from your feet," and he did so, going naked and barefoot--
23Is 20:3 the LORD said, "As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,
23Is 20:4 so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks, to Egypt's shame.
23Is 20:5 Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast will be dismayed and ashamed.
23Is 20:6 And the inhabitants of this coastland will say on that day: Look, this is what has happened to those we relied on and fled to for help to rescue [us] from the king of Assyria! Now, how will we escape?"
23Is 21:1 An oracle against the desert by the sea: Like storms that pass over the Negev, it comes from the desert, from the land of terror.
23Is 21:2 A troubling vision is declared to me: "The treacherous one acts treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Advance, Elam! Lay siege, you Medes! I will put an end to all her groaning."
23Is 21:3 Therefore I am filled with anguish. Pain grips me, like the pain of a woman in labor. I am too perplexed to hear, too dismayed to see.
23Is 21:4 My heart staggers; horror terrifies me. He has turned my last glimmer of hope into sheer terror.
23Is 21:5 Prepare a table, and spread out a carpet! Eat and drink! Rise up, you princes, and oil the shields!
23Is 21:6 For the Lord has said to me, "Go, post a lookout; let him report what he sees.
23Is 21:7 When he sees riders-- pairs of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels-- pay close attention."
23Is 21:8 Then the lookout reported, "Lord, I stand on the watchtower all day, and I stay at my post all night.
23Is 21:9 Look, riders come-- horsemen in pairs." And he answered, saying, "Babylon has fallen, has fallen. All the idols of her gods have been shattered on the ground."
23Is 21:10 My downtrodden and threshed people, I have declared to you what I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.
23Is 21:11 An oracle against Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is [left] of the night? Watchman, what is [left] of the night?"
23Is 21:12 The watchman said, "Morning has come, and also night. If you want to ask, ask! Come back again."
23Is 21:13 An oracle against Arabia: You will camp for the night in the scrublands of the desert, you caravans of Dedanites.
23Is 21:14 Bring water for the thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema meet the refugees with food.
23Is 21:15 For they have fled from swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, from the stress of battle.
23Is 21:16 For the Lord said this to me: "Within one year, as a hired worker counts years, all the glory of Kedar will be gone.
23Is 21:17 The remaining Kedarite archers will be few in number." For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
23Is 22:1 An oracle against the Valley of Vision: What's the matter with you? Why have all of you gone up to the rooftops?
23Is 22:2 The noisy city, the jubilant town, is filled with revelry. Your dead did not die by the sword; they were not killed in battle.
23Is 22:3 All your rulers have fled together, captured without a bow. All your fugitives were captured together; they had fled far away.
23Is 22:4 Therefore I said, "Look away from me! Let me weep bitterly! Do not try to comfort me about the destruction of my dear people."
23Is 22:5 For the Lord God of Hosts had a day of tumult, trampling, and bewilderment in the Valley of Vision-- people shouting and crying to the mountains;
23Is 22:6 Elam took up a quiver with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
23Is 22:7 Your best valleys were full of chariots, and horsemen were positioned at the gates.
23Is 22:8 He removed the defenses of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
23Is 22:9 You saw that there were many breaches in [the walls of] the city of David. You collected water from the lower pool.
23Is 22:10 You counted the houses of Jerusalem so that you could tear them down to fortify the wall.
23Is 22:11 You made a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider the One who created it long ago.
23Is 22:12 On that day the Lord God of Hosts called for weeping, for wailing, for shaven heads, and for the wearing of sackcloth.
23Is 22:13 But look: joy and gladness, butchering of cattle, slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat, and drinking of wine-- "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"
23Is 22:14 The LORD of Hosts has revealed [this] in my hearing: "This sin of yours will never be wiped out." The Lord God of Hosts has spoken.
23Is 22:15 The Lord God of Hosts said: "Go to Shebna, that steward who is in charge of the palace, [and say to him:]
23Is 22:16 What are you doing here? Who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here, carving your tomb on the height and cutting a crypt for yourself out of rock?
23Is 22:17 Look, young man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you,
23Is 22:18 wind you up into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will be-- a disgrace to the house of your lord.
23Is 22:19 I will remove you from your office; you will be ousted from your position.
23Is 22:20 "On that day I will call for my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
23Is 22:21 I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority into his hand, and he will be like a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the House of Judah.
23Is 22:22 I will place the key of the House of David on his shoulder; what he opens, no one can close; what he closes, no one can open.
23Is 22:23 I will drive him, like a peg, into a firm place. He will be a throne of honor for his father's house.
23Is 22:24 They will hang on him the whole burden of his father's house: the descendants and the offshoots-- all the small vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
23Is 22:25 On that day"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "the peg that was driven into a firm place will give way, be cut off, and fall, and the load on it will be destroyed." Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
23Is 23:1 An oracle against Tyre: Wail, ships of Tarshish, for your haven has been destroyed. Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus.
23Is 23:2 Mourn, inhabitants of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon; your agents have crossed the sea
23Is 23:3 on many waters. Tyre's revenue was the grain from Shihor-- the harvest of the Nile. She was the merchant among the nations.
23Is 23:4 Be ashamed Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken: "I have not been in labor or given birth. I have not raised young men [or] brought up young women."
23Is 23:5 When the news reaches Egypt, they will be in anguish over the news about Tyre.
23Is 23:6 Cross over to Tarshish; wail, inhabitants of the coastland!
23Is 23:7 Is this your jubilant [city], whose origin was in ancient times, whose feet have taken her to settle far away?
23Is 23:8 Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose traders are princes, whose merchants are the honored ones of the earth?
23Is 23:9 The LORD of Hosts planned it, to desecrate all [its] glorious beauty, to disgrace all the honored ones of the earth.
23Is 23:10 Overflow your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer anything to restrain [you].
23Is 23:11 He stretched out His hand over the sea; He made kingdoms tremble. The LORD has commanded that the Canaanite fortresses be destroyed.
23Is 23:12 He said, "You will not rejoice any more, ravished young woman, daughter of Sidon. Get up and cross over to Cyprus-- even there you will have no rest!"
23Is 23:13 Look at the land of Chaldeans-- a people who no longer exist. Assyria destined it for wild beasts. They set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They made it a ruin.
23Is 23:14 Wail, ships of Tarshish, because your fortress is destroyed!
23Is 23:15 On that day Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years-- the life span of one king. At the end of 70 years, what the song [says] about the prostitute will happen to Tyre:
23Is 23:16 Pick up [your] harp, stroll through the city, prostitute forgotten [by men]. Play skillfully, sing many a song, and you will be thought of again.
23Is 23:17 And at the end of the 70 years, the LORD will restore Tyre and she will go back into business, prostituting herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23Is 23:18 But her profits and wages will be dedicated to the LORD. They will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live in the LORD's presence, to provide them with ample food and sacred clothing.
23Is 24:1 Look, the LORD is stripping the earth bare and making it desolate. He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants:
23Is 24:2 people and priest alike, servant and master, female servant and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, creditor and debtor.
23Is 24:3 The earth will be stripped completely bare and will be totally plundered, for the LORD has spoken this message.
23Is 24:4 The earth mourns and withers; the world wastes away and withers; the exalted people of the earth waste away.
23Is 24:5 The earth is polluted by its inhabitants, for they have transgressed teachings, overstepped decrees, and broken the everlasting covenant.
23Is 24:6 Therefore a curse has consumed the earth, and its inhabitants have become guilty; the earth's inhabitants have been burned, and only a few survive.
23Is 24:7 The new wine mourns; the vine withers. All the carousers now groan.
23Is 24:8 The joyful tambourines have ceased. The noise of the jubilant has stopped. The joyful lyre has ceased.
23Is 24:9 They no longer sing and drink wine; beer is bitter to those who drink it.
23Is 24:10 The city of chaos is shattered; every house is closed to entry.
23Is 24:11 In the streets they cry for wine. All joy grows dark; earth's rejoicing goes into exile.
23Is 24:12 Only desolation remains in the city; its gate has collapsed in ruins.
23Is 24:13 For this is how it will be on earth among the nations: like a harvested olive tree, like a gleaning after a grape harvest.
23Is 24:14 They raise their voices, they sing out; they proclaim in the west the majesty of the LORD.
23Is 24:15 Therefore in the east honor the LORD! In the islands of the west [honor] the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23Is 24:16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs: The Splendor of the Righteous One. But I said, "I waste away! I waste away! Woe is me." The treacherous act treacherously; the treacherous deal very treacherously.
23Is 24:17 Terror, pit, and snare [await] you who dwell on the earth.
23Is 24:18 Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit, and whoever escapes from the pit will be caught in a snare. For the windows are opened from above, and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
23Is 24:19 The earth is completely devastated; the earth is split open; the earth is violently shaken.
23Is 24:20 The earth staggers like a drunkard and sways like a hut. Earth's rebellion weighs it down, and it falls, never to rise again.
23Is 24:21 On that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven above and kings of the earth below.
23Is 24:22 They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit. They will be confined to a dungeon; after many days they will be punished.
23Is 24:23 The moon will be put to shame and the sun disgraced, because the LORD of Hosts will reign as king on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, and He will [display His] glory in the presence of His elders.
23Is 25:1 LORD, You are my God; I will exalt You. I will praise Your name, for You have accomplished wonders, plans [formed] long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
23Is 25:2 For You have turned the city into a pile of rubble, a fortified city, into a ruin; the fortress of barbarians is no longer a city; it will never be rebuilt.
23Is 25:3 Therefore, a strong people will honor You. A city of violent people will fear You.
23Is 25:4 For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the humble person in his distress, a refuge from the rain, a shade from the heat. When the breath of the violent is like rain [against] a wall,
23Is 25:5 like heat in a dry land, You subdue the uproar of barbarians. As the shade of a cloud [cools] the heat of the day, [so] He stills the song of the violent.
23Is 25:6 The LORD of Hosts will prepare a feast for all the peoples on this mountain-- a feast of aged wine, choice meat, finely aged wine.
23Is 25:7 On this mountain [He] will destroy the [burial] shroud, the shroud over all the peoples, the sheet covering all the nations;
23Is 25:8 He will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away the tears from every face and remove His people's disgrace from the whole earth, for the LORD has spoken.
23Is 25:9 On that day it will be said, "Look, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation."
23Is 25:10 For the LORD's power will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trampled in a dung pile.
23Is 25:11 He will spread out his arms in the middle of it, as a swimmer spreads out [his arms] to swim. His pride will be brought low, along with the trickery of his hands.
23Is 25:12 The high-walled fortress will be brought down, thrown to the ground, to the dust.
23Is 26:1 On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city. Salvation is established as walls and ramparts.
23Is 26:2 Open the gates so a righteous nation can come in-- one that remains faithful.
23Is 26:3 You will keep in perfect peace the mind [that is] dependent [on You], for it is trusting in You.
23Is 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever, because in Yah, the LORD, is an everlasting rock!
23Is 26:5 For He has humbled those who live in lofty places-- an inaccessible city. He brings it down; He brings it down to the ground; He throws it to the dust.
23Is 26:6 Feet trample it, the feet of the humble, the steps of the poor.
23Is 26:7 The path of the righteous is level; You clear a straight path for the righteous.
23Is 26:8 Yes, LORD, we wait for You in the path of Your judgments. Our desire is for Your name and renown.
23Is 26:9 I long for You in the night; yes, my spirit within me diligently seeks You, for when Your judgments are [in] the land, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
23Is 26:10 [But if] the wicked is shown favor, he does not learn righteousness. In a righteous land he acts unjustly and does not see the majesty of the LORD.
23Is 26:11 LORD, Your hand is lifted up [to take action], but they do not see it. They will see [Your] zeal for [Your] people, and they will be put to shame. The fire for Your adversaries will consume them!
23Is 26:12 LORD, You will establish peace for us, for You have also done all our work for us.
23Is 26:13 LORD, our God, other lords than You have ruled over us, but we remember Your name alone.
23Is 26:14 The dead do not live; departed spirits do not rise up. Indeed, You have visited and destroyed them; You have wiped out all memory of them.
23Is 26:15 You have added to the nation, LORD. You have added to the nation; You are honored. You have expanded all the borders of the land.
23Is 26:16 LORD, they went to You in their distress; they poured out whispered [prayers because] Your discipline [fell] on them.
23Is 26:17 As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pains, so we were before You, LORD.
23Is 26:18 We became pregnant, we writhed in pain; we gave birth to wind. We have won no victories on earth, and the earth's inhabitants have not fallen.
23Is 26:19 Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust! For you will be covered with the morning dew, and the earth will bring forth the departed spirits.
23Is 26:20 Go, my people, enter your rooms and close your doors behind you. Hide for a little while until the wrath has passed.
23Is 26:21 For look, the LORD is coming from His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth will reveal the blood shed on it and will no longer conceal her slain.
23Is 27:1 On that day the LORD with His harsh, great, and strong sword, will bring judgment on Leviathan, the fleeing serpent-- Leviathan, the twisting serpent. He will slay the monster that is in the sea.
23Is 27:2 On that day sing about a desirable vineyard:
23Is 27:3 I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it regularly. I guard it night and day so that no one disturbs it.
23Is 27:4 I am not angry, but if it produces thorns and briers for Me, I will fight against it, trample it, and burn it to the ground.
23Is 27:5 Or let it take hold of My strength; let it make peace with Me-- make peace with Me.
23Is 27:6 In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bloom and fill the whole world with fruit.
23Is 27:7 Did the LORD strike Israel as He struck the one who struck Israel? Was he killed like those killed by Him?
23Is 27:8 You disputed with her by banishing and driving her away. He removed [her] with His severe storm on the day of the east wind.
23Is 27:9 Therefore Jacob's iniquity will be purged in this way, and the result of the removal of his sin will be this: when he makes all the altar stones like crushed bits of chalk, no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.
23Is 27:10 For the fortified city will be deserted, pastures abandoned and forsaken like a wilderness. Calves will graze there, and there they will spread out and strip its branches.
23Is 27:11 When its branches dry out, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them, for they are not a people with understanding. Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and their Creator will not be gracious to them.
23Is 27:12 On that day the LORD will thresh grain from the Euphrates River as far as the Wadi of Egypt, and you Israelites will be gathered one by one.
23Is 27:13 On that day a great trumpet will be blown, and those lost in the land of Assyria will come, as well as those dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they will worship the LORD at Jerusalem on the holy mountain.
23Is 28:1 Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim's drunkards, and to the fading flower of its beautiful splendor, which is on the summit above the rich valley. [Woe] to those overcome with wine.
23Is 28:2 Look, the Lord has a strong and mighty one-- like a devastating hail storm, like a storm with strong flooding waters. He will bring it across the land with [His] hand.
23Is 28:3 The majestic crown of Ephraim's drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
23Is 28:4 The fading flower of his beautiful splendor, which is on the summit above the rich valley, will be like a ripe fig before the summer harvest. Whoever sees it will swallow it while it is still in his hand.
23Is 28:5 On that day the LORD of Hosts will become a crown of beauty and a diadem of splendor to the remnant of His people,
23Is 28:6 a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
23Is 28:7 These also stagger because of wine and stumble under the influence of beer: priest and prophet stagger because of beer, they are confused by wine. They stumble because of beer, they are muddled in [their] visions, they stumble in [their] judgments.
23Is 28:8 Indeed, all their tables are covered with vomit; there is no place without a stench.
23Is 28:9 Who is he trying to teach? Who is he trying to instruct? Infants [just] weaned from milk? Babies removed from the breast?
23Is 28:10 For [he says]: "Law after law, law after law, line after line, line after line, a little here, a little there."
23Is 28:11 So He will speak to this people with stammering speech and in a foreign language.
23Is 28:12 He had said to them: "This is the place of rest, let the weary rest; this is the place of repose." But they would not listen.
23Is 28:13 Then the word of the LORD came to them: "Law after law, law after law, line after line, line after line, a little here, a little there," so they go stumbling backwards, to be broken, trapped, and captured.
23Is 28:14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you mockers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
23Is 28:15 For you said, "We have cut a deal with Death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, it will not touch us, because we have made falsehood our refuge and have hidden behind treachery."
23Is 28:16 Therefore the Lord God said: "Look, I have laid a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; the one who believes will be unshakable.
23Is 28:17 And I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the mason's level." Hail will sweep away the false refuge, and water will flood your hiding place.
23Is 28:18 Your deal with Death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not last. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled.
23Is 28:19 Every time it passes through, it will carry you away; it will pass through every morning-- every day and every night. Only terror will cause you to understand the message.
23Is 28:20 Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, and its cover too small to wrap up in.
23Is 28:21 For the LORD will rise up as [He did] at Mount Perazim. He will rise in wrath, as at the valley of Gibeon, to do His work, His strange work, and to perform His task, His disturbing task.
23Is 28:22 So now, do not mock, or your shackles will become stronger. Indeed, I have heard from the Lord God of Hosts a decree of destruction for the whole land.
23Is 28:23 Listen and hear my voice. Pay attention and hear what I say.
23Is 28:24 Does the plowman plow every day to plant seed? Does he [continuously] break up and cultivate the soil?
23Is 28:25 When he has leveled its surface, does he not then scatter cumin and sow black cumin? He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots, with spelt as their border.
23Is 28:26 His God teaches him order; He instructs him.
23Is 28:27 Certainly black cumin is not threshed with a threshing board, and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cumin. But black cumin is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
23Is 28:28 Bread grain is crushed, but is not threshed endlessly. Though the wheel of [the farmer's] cart rumbles, his horses do not crush it.
23Is 28:29 This also comes from the LORD of Hosts. He gives wonderful advice; He gives great wisdom.
23Is 29:1 Woe to Ariel, Ariel, the city where David camped! Continue year after year; let the festivals recur.
23Is 29:2 I will oppress Ariel, and there will be mourning and crying, and she will be to Me like an Ariel.
23Is 29:3 I will camp in a circle around you; I will besiege you with earth ramps, and I will set up my siege towers against you.
23Is 29:4 You will be brought down; you will speak from the ground, and your words will come from low in the dust. Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper from the dust.
23Is 29:5 The multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless, like blowing chaff. Then suddenly, in an instant,
23Is 29:6 you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise, storm, tempest, and a flame of consuming fire.
23Is 29:7 The multitude of all the nations going out to battle against Ariel-- all the attackers, the siege-works against her, and those who oppress her-- will then be like a dream, a vision in the night.
23Is 29:8 It will be like a hungry one who dreams he is eating, then wakes and is still hungry; and like a thirsty one who dreams he is drinking, then wakes and is still thirsty, longing for water. So will be the multitude of all the nations who go to battle against Mount Zion.
23Is 29:9 Stop and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with beer.
23Is 29:10 For the LORD has poured out on you an overwhelming urge to sleep; He has shut your eyes-- the prophets, and covered your heads-- the seers.
23Is 29:11 For you the entire vision will be like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to one who can read and he is asked to read it, he will say, "I can't read it, because it is sealed."
23Is 29:12 And if the document is given to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it, he will say, "I can't read."
23Is 29:13 The Lord said: Because these people approach Me with their mouths to honor Me with lip-service-- yet their hearts are far from Me, and their worship [consists of] man-made rules learned [by rote]--
23Is 29:14 therefore I will again confound these people with wonder after wonder. The wisdom of their wise men will vanish, and the understanding of the perceptive will be hidden.
23Is 29:15 Woe to those who go to great lengths to hide their plans from the LORD. [They do] their works in darkness, and say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?"
23Is 29:16 You have turned things around, as if the potter were the same as the clay. How can what is made say about its maker, "He didn't make me"? How can what is formed say about the one who formed it, "He doesn't understand [what he's doing]"?
23Is 29:17 Isn't [it true that] in just a little while Lebanon will become an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest?
23Is 29:18 On that day the deaf will hear the words of a document, and out of a deep darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
23Is 29:19 The humble will have joy after joy in the LORD, and the poor people will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 29:20 For the ruthless one will vanish, the scorner will disappear, and all those who lie in wait with evil intent will be killed--
23Is 29:21 those who, with [their] speech, accuse a person of wrongdoing, who set a trap at the gate for the mediator, and without cause deprive the righteous of justice.
23Is 29:22 Therefore, the LORD who redeemed Abraham says this about the house of Jacob: Jacob will no longer be ashamed and his face will no longer be pale.
23Is 29:23 For when he sees his children, the work of My hands within his [nation], they will honor My name, they will honor the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23Is 29:24 Those who are confused will gain understanding and those who grumble will accept instruction.
23Is 30:1 Woe to the rebellious children! [This is] the LORD's declaration. They carry out a plan, but not Mine, They make an alliance, but against My will, piling sin on top of sin.
23Is 30:2 They set out to go down to Egypt without asking My advice, in order to seek shelter under Pharaoh's protection and take refuge in Egypt's shadow.
23Is 30:3 But Pharaoh's protection will become your shame, and refuge in Egypt's shadow your disgrace.
23Is 30:4 For though his princes are at Zoan and his messengers reach as far as Hanes,
23Is 30:5 everyone will be ashamed because of a people who can't help. They are of no benefit, they are no help; they are good for nothing but shame and reproach.
23Is 30:6 An oracle about the animals of the Negev: Through a land of trouble and distress, of lioness and lion, of viper and flying serpent, they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who will not help them.
23Is 30:7 Egypt's help is completely worthless; therefore, I call her: Rahab Who Just Sits.
23Is 30:8 Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence and inscribe it on a scroll; it will be for the future, forever and ever.
23Is 30:9 They are a rebellious people, deceptive children, children who do not obey the LORD's instruction.
23Is 30:10 They say to the seers, "Do not see," and to the prophets, "Do not prophesy the truth to us. Tell us flattering things. Prophesy illusions.
23Is 30:11 Get out of the way! Leave the pathway. Rid us of the Holy One of Israel."
23Is 30:12 Therefore the Holy One of Israel says: "Because you have rejected this message and have trusted in oppression and deceit, and have depended on them,
23Is 30:13 this iniquity of yours will be like a spreading breach, a bulge in a high wall whose collapse will come very suddenly.
23Is 30:14 Its collapse will be like the shattering of a potter's jar, crushed to pieces, so that not even a fragment of pottery will be found among its shattered remains-- no fragment large enough to take fire from a hearth or scoop water from a cistern."
23Is 30:15 For the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has said: "You will be delivered by returning and resting; your strength will lie in quiet confidence. But you are not willing."
23Is 30:16 You say, "No! We will escape on horses"-- therefore you will escape!-- and, "We will ride on fast horses"-- but those who pursue you will be faster.
23Is 30:17 One thousand [will flee] at the threat of one, at the threat of five you will flee, until you alone remain like a [solitary] pole on a mountaintop or a banner on a hill.
23Is 30:18 Therefore the LORD is waiting to show you mercy, and is rising up to show you compassion, for the LORD is a just God. Happy are all who wait patiently for Him.
23Is 30:19 For you people will live on Zion in Jerusalem and will never cry again. He will show favor to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears, He will answer you.
23Is 30:20 The Lord will give you meager bread and water during oppression, but your Teacher will not hide Himself any longer. Your eyes will see your Teacher,
23Is 30:21 and whenever you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: "This is the way. Walk in it."
23Is 30:22 Then you will defile your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, and call them filth.
23Is 30:23 Then He will send rain for your seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures.
23Is 30:24 The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder scattered with winnowing shovel and fork.
23Is 30:25 Streams and watercourses will be on every high mountain and every raised hill on the day of great slaughter when the towers fall.
23Is 30:26 The moonlight will be as bright as the sunlight, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter-- like the light of seven days-- on the day that the LORD bandages His people's injuries and heals the wounds He inflicted.
23Is 30:27 Look, Yahweh comes from far away, His anger burning and heavy with smoke. His lips are full of fury, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.
23Is 30:28 His breath is like an overflowing torrent that rises to the neck. [He comes] to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction and to put a bridle on the jaws of the peoples to lead [them] astray.
23Is 30:29 Your singing will be like that on the night of a holy festival, And [your] heart will rejoice like one who walks [to the music] of a flute, going up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23Is 30:30 And the LORD will make the splendor of His voice heard and reveal His arm striking in angry wrath and a flame of consuming fire, in driving rain, a torrent, and hailstones.
23Is 30:31 Assyria will be shattered by the voice of the LORD. He will strike with a rod.
23Is 30:32 And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD brings down on him will be [to the sound] of tambourines and lyres; He will fight against him with brandished weapons.
23Is 30:33 Indeed! Topheth has been ready for the king for a long time now. His funeral pyre is deep and wide, with plenty of fire and wood. The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, kindles it.
23Is 31:1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and who depend on horses! They trust in the number of chariots and in the great strength of charioteers. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel and they do not seek the LORD's help.
23Is 31:2 But He also is wise and brings disaster. He does not go back on what He says; He will rise up against the house of wicked men and against the allies of evildoers.
23Is 31:3 Egyptians are men, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD raises His hand [to strike], the helper will stumble and the helped will fall; both will perish together.
23Is 31:4 For this is what the LORD said to me: As a lion or young lion growls over its prey when a band of shepherds is called out against it, and is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their noise, so the LORD of Hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
23Is 31:5 Like hovering birds, so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem-- by protecting [it], He will rescue [it], by sparing [it], He will deliver [it].
23Is 31:6 Return to the One the Israelites have greatly rebelled against.
23Is 31:7 For on that day, each one will reject the silver and gold idols that your own hands have sinfully made.
23Is 31:8 Then Assyria will fall, but not by human sword; a sword will devour him, but not one made by man. He will flee from the sword, his young men will be put to forced labor.
23Is 31:9 His rock will pass away because of fear, and his officers will be afraid because of the signal flag. [This is] the LORD's declaration-- whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23Is 32:1 Indeed, a king will reign righteously, and rulers will rule justly.
23Is 32:2 Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the rain, like streams of water in a dry land and the shade of a massive rock in an arid land.
23Is 32:3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.
23Is 32:4 The reckless mind will gain knowledge, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.
23Is 32:5 A fool will no longer be called a noble, nor a scoundrel said to be important.
23Is 32:6 For a fool speaks foolishness and his mind plots iniquity. He lives in a godless way and speaks falsely about the LORD. He leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.
23Is 32:7 The scoundrel's weapons are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the needy with lies, and by charging the poor during a judgment.
23Is 32:8 But a noble person plans noble things; he stands up for noble causes.
23Is 32:9 Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Pay attention to what I say, you overconfident daughters.
23Is 32:10 In a little more than a year you overconfident ones will shudder, for the vintage will fail and the harvest will not come.
23Is 32:11 Shudder, you complacent ones; tremble, you overconfident ones! Strip yourselves bare and put [ sackcloth] about your waists.
23Is 32:12 Beat your breasts [in mourning] for the delightful fields and the fruitful vines,
23Is 32:13 for the ground of my people growing thorns and briers, indeed, for every joyous house in the joyful city.
23Is 32:14 For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become barren places forever, the joy of wild asses, and a pasture for flocks,
23Is 32:15 until the Spirit from heaven is poured out on us. Then the desert will become an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.
23Is 32:16 Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the orchard.
23Is 32:17 The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.
23Is 32:18 Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, and in safe and restful dwellings.
23Is 32:19 But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink into the depths.
23Is 32:20 Happy are you who sow seed beside abundant waters, who let ox and donkey range freely.
23Is 33:1 Woe, you destroyer never destroyed, you traitor never betrayed! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed. When you have finished betraying, they will betray you.
23Is 33:2 LORD, be gracious to us! We wait for You. Be our strength every morning, and our salvation in time of trouble.
23Is 33:3 The peoples flee at the thunderous noise; the nations scatter when You rise in Your majesty.
23Is 33:4 Your spoil will be gathered as locusts are gathered; people will swarm over it like an infestation of locusts.
23Is 33:5 The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
23Is 33:6 There will be times of security for you-- a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the LORD is Zion's treasure.
23Is 33:7 Listen! Their warriors cry loudly in the streets; the messengers of peace weep bitterly.
23Is 33:8 The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. An agreement has been broken, and cities despised. and human life disregarded.
23Is 33:9 The land mourns and withers; Lebanon is ashamed and decayed. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off [their] leaves.
23Is 33:10 "Now I will rise up," says the LORD. "Now I will lift Myself up. Now I will be exalted.
23Is 33:11 You will conceive chaff; you will give birth to stubble. Your breath is fire that will consume you.
23Is 33:12 The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and burned in a fire.
23Is 33:13 You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, know My strength."
23Is 33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the ungodly: "Who among us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with ever-burning flames?"
23Is 33:15 The one who lives righteously and speaks rightly, who refuses gain from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears from listening to murderous plots and shuts his eyes to avoid endorsing evil--
23Is 33:16 he will dwell on the heights; his refuge will be the rocky fortresses, his food provided, his water assured.
23Is 33:17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; you will see a vast land.
23Is 33:18 Your mind will meditate on the [past] terror: "Where is the accountant? Where is the tribute collector? Where is the one who spied out our defenses?"
23Is 33:19 You will no longer see the barbarians, a people whose speech is difficult to comprehend-- who stammer in a language that is not understood.
23Is 33:20 Look at Zion, the city of our festival times. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up nor will any of its cords be loosened.
23Is 33:21 For there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us, a place of rivers and broad streams, where ships that are rowed will not go, and majestic vessels will not pass.
23Is 33:22 For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our King. He will save us.
23Is 33:23 Your ropes are slack; they cannot hold the base of the mast or spread out the flag. Then abundant spoil will be divided, the lame will plunder it,
23Is 33:24 and none there will say, "I am sick." The people who dwell there will be forgiven [their] iniquity.
23Is 34:1 You nations, come here and listen; you peoples, pay attention! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it, the world and all that comes from it.
23Is 34:2 The LORD is angry with all the nations-- furious with all their armies. He will set them apart for destruction, giving them over to slaughter.
23Is 34:3 Their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains flow with their blood.
23Is 34:4 All the heavenly bodies will dissolve. The skies will roll up like a scroll, and their stars will all wither as leaves wither on the vine, and foliage on the fig tree.
23Is 34:5 When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens it will then come down on Edom and on the people I have set apart for destruction.
23Is 34:6 The LORD's sword is covered with blood. It drips with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23Is 34:7 The wild oxen will be struck down with them, and young bulls with the mighty bulls. Their land will be soaked with blood, and their soil will be saturated with fat.
23Is 34:8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a time of paying back [Edom] for its hostility against Zion.
23Is 34:9 [Edom's] streams will be turned into pitch, her soil into sulfur; her land will become burning pitch.
23Is 34:10 It will never go out-- day or night. Its smoke will go up forever. It will be desolate, from generation to generation; no one will pass through it forever and ever.
23Is 34:11 The desert owl and the hedgehog will possess it, and the great owl and the raven will dwell there. [The LORD] will stretch out a measuring line and a plumb line over her for [her] destruction and chaos.
23Is 34:12 No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing.
23Is 34:13 Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns; her fortified cities, with thistles and briers. She will become a dwelling for jackals, an abode for ostriches.
23Is 34:14 The wild beasts will meet hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. Indeed, the screech owl will stay there and will find a resting place for herself.
23Is 34:15 The sand partridge will make her nest there; she will lay and hatch her eggs and will gather [her brood] under her shadow. Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there, each with its mate.
23Is 34:16 Search and read the scroll of the LORD: Not one of them will be missing, none will be lacking its mate, because He has ordered it by my mouth, and He will gather them by His Spirit.
23Is 34:17 He has ordained a lot for them; His hand allotted their portion with a measuring line. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
23Is 35:1 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
23Is 35:2 It will blossom abundantly and will also rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.
23Is 35:3 Strengthen the weak hands, steady the shaking knees!
23Is 35:4 Say to the faint-hearted: "Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God; vengeance is coming. God's retribution is coming; He will save you."
23Is 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
23Is 35:6 Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy, for water will gush in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;
23Is 35:7 the parched ground will become a pool of water, and the thirsty land springs of water. In the haunt of jackals, in their lairs, there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus.
23Is 35:8 A road will be there and a way; it will be called the Holy Way. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for him who walks the path. Even the fool will not go astray.
23Is 35:9 There will be no lion there, and no vicious beast will go up on it; they will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk [on it],
23Is 35:10 and the ransomed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake [them], and sorrow and sighing will flee.
23Is 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23Is 36:2 Then the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh, along with a massive army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. The Assyrian stood near the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to the Fuller's Field.
23Is 36:3 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the record keeper, came out to him.
23Is 36:4 The Rabshakeh said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: The great king, the king of Assyria, says this: 'What are you basing your confidence on?
23Is 36:5 I say that your plans and military preparedness are mere words. Now who are you trusting in that you have rebelled against me?
23Is 36:6 Look, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which will enter and pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. This is how Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him.
23Is 36:7 Suppose you say to me: We trust in the LORD our God. Isn't He the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem: You are to worship at this altar?
23Is 36:8 Now make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I'll give you 2,000 horses if you can put riders on them!
23Is 36:9 How then can you repel [the attack of even] the weakest of my master's officers, and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
23Is 36:10 Have I attacked this land to destroy it without the LORD's [approval]? The LORD said to me, 'Attack this land and destroy it.'"
23Is 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand [it]; don't speak to us in Hebrew within earshot of the people who are on the wall."
23Is 36:12 But the Rabshakeh replied, "Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men who sit on the wall, [who are destined] with you to eat their excrement and drink their urine?"
23Is 36:13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23Is 36:14 The king says: "Don't let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you.
23Is 36:15 Don't let Hezekiah persuade you to trust the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'"
23Is 36:16 Don't listen to Hezekiah. For the king of Assyria says: "Make peace with me and surrender to me; then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree and drink water from his own cistern
23Is 36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23Is 36:18 [Beware] that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
23Is 36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
23Is 36:20 Who of all the gods of these lands [ever] delivered his land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem?"
23Is 36:21 But they were silent and did not answer him at all, for the king's command was, "Don't answer him."
23Is 36:22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the record keeper, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of the Rabshakeh.
23Is 37:1 When King Hezekiah heard [their report], he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the house of the LORD.
23Is 37:2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and the older priests, wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23Is 37:3 They said to him, "Hezekiah says: 'Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, [as] when children come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.
23Is 37:4 Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master, the king of Assyria, sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke [him for] the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore offer a prayer for the surviving remnant.'"
23Is 37:5 When King Hezekiah's servants came to Isaiah,
23Is 37:6 Isaiah said to them, "Say this to your master, 'The LORD says: Don't be afraid because of the words you have heard, which the king of Assyria's attendants have blasphemed Me with.
23Is 37:7 Look! I am putting a spirit in him and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.'"
23Is 37:8 When the Rabshakeh heard that the king had left Lachish, he returned and discovered that the king of Assyria was fighting against Libnah.
23Is 37:9 The king had heard this about Tirhakah, king of Cush: "He has set out to fight against you." So when he heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
23Is 37:10 "Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Don't let your God, whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem won't be handed over to the king of Assyria.
23Is 37:11 Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries; they destroyed them completely. Will you be rescued?
23Is 37:12 Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed rescue them-- Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar?
23Is 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah?'"
23Is 37:14 Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers, read it, then went up to the LORD's house and spread it out before the LORD.
23Is 37:15 Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
23Is 37:16 "LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are God-- You alone-- of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
23Is 37:17 Listen closely, LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, LORD, and see; hear all the words that Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God.
23Is 37:18 LORD, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated all these countries and their lands
23Is 37:19 and have thrown their gods into the fire; for they were not gods but made by human hands-- wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
23Is 37:20 Now, LORD our God, save us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD-- You alone."
23Is 37:21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent [a message] to Hezekiah: "The LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23Is 37:22 this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: The young woman, Daughter Zion, despises you and scorns you: Daughter Jerusalem shakes [her] head behind your back.
23Is 37:23 Who is it you have mocked and blasphemed? Who have you raised [your] voice against and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23Is 37:24 You have mocked the LORD through your servants. You have said: With my many chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars, its choice cypress trees. I came to its remotest heights, its densest forest.
23Is 37:25 I dug [wells] and drank water. I dried up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.
23Is 37:26 Have you not heard? I designed it long ago; I planned it in days gone by. I have now brought it to pass, and you have crushed fortified cities into piles of rubble.
23Is 37:27 Their inhabitants have become powerless, dismayed, and ashamed. They are plants of the field, tender grass, grass on the rooftops, blasted by the east wind.
23Is 37:28 But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me.
23Is 37:29 Because your raging against Me and your arrogance has reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will make you go back the way you came.
23Is 37:30 " 'This will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what grows from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 37:31 The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
23Is 37:32 For a remnant will go out from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.'
23Is 37:33 " 'Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or build up an assault ramp against it.
23Is 37:34 He will go back on the road that he came and he will not enter this city. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
23Is 37:35 I will defend this city and rescue it, because of Me and because of My servant David.'"
23Is 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the [next] morning-- there were all the dead bodies!
23Is 37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned [home] and lived in Nineveh.
23Is 37:38 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. Then his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.
23Is 38:1 In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Put your affairs in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.'"
23Is 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD.
23Is 38:3 He said, "Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and wholeheartedly, and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23Is 38:4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
23Is 38:5 "Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I am going to add 15 years to your life.
23Is 38:6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city.
23Is 38:7 This is the sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do what He has promised:
23Is 38:8 I am going to make the sun's shadow that goes down on Ahaz's stairway return by 10 steps." So the sun's shadow went back the 10 steps it had descended.
23Is 38:9 A poem by Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness:
23Is 38:10 I said: In the prime of my life I must go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.
23Is 38:11 I said: I will never see the LORD, the LORD in the land of the living; I will not look on humanity any longer with the inhabitants of what is passing away.
23Is 38:12 My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd's tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; He cuts me off from the loom. You make an end of me from day until night.
23Is 38:13 I thought until the morning: He will break all my bones like a lion; You make an end of me day and night.
23Is 38:14 I chirp like a swallow [or] a crane; I moan like a dove. My eyes grow weak looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed; support me.
23Is 38:15 What can I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it. I walk along slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul,
23Is 38:16 Lord, because of these [promises] people live, and in all of them is the life of my spirit as well; You have restored me to health and let me live.
23Is 38:17 Indeed, it was for [my own] welfare that I had such great bitterness; but Your love [has delivered] me from the Pit of destruction, for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back.
23Is 38:18 For Sheol cannot thank You; Death cannot praise You. Those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
23Is 38:19 The living, only the living can thank You, as I do today; a father will make Your faithfulness known to children
23Is 38:20 The LORD will save me; we will play stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the house of the LORD.
23Is 38:21 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a lump of figs and apply it to his infected skin, so that he may recover."
23Is 38:22 And Hezekiah had asked, "What is the sign that I will go up to the LORD's temple?"
23Is 39:1 At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah since he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
23Is 39:2 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them his treasure house-- the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil-- and all his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace and in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
23Is 39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say? The men who came to you-- where were they from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon."
23Is 39:4 And he asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my palace. There isn't anything in my storehouses that I didn't show them."
23Is 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts:
23Is 39:6 'The time will certainly come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,' says the LORD.
23Is 39:7 'Some of your descendants who come from you will be taken away, and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
23Is 39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good." For he thought: There will be peace and security during my lifetime.
23Is 40:1 "Comfort, comfort My people," says your God.
23Is 40:2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and announce to her that her time of servitude is over, her iniquity has been pardoned, and she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
23Is 40:3 A voice of one crying out: Prepare the way of the LORD in the wilderness; make a straight highway for our God in the desert.
23Is 40:4 Every valley will be lifted up, and every mountain and hill will be leveled; the uneven ground will become smooth, and the rough places a plain.
23Is 40:5 And the glory of the LORD will appear, and all humanity will see [it] together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23Is 40:6 A voice was saying, "Cry out!" Another said, "What should I cry out?" "All humanity is grass, and all its goodness is like the flower of the field.
23Is 40:7 The grass withers, the flowers fade when the breath of the LORD blows on them; indeed, the people are grass.
23Is 40:8 The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever."
23Is 40:9 Zion, herald of good news, go up on a high mountain. Jerusalem, herald of good news, raise your voice loudly. Raise it, do not be afraid! Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
23Is 40:10 See, the Lord God comes with strength, and His power establishes His rule. His reward is with Him, and His gifts accompany Him.
23Is 40:11 He protects His flock like a shepherd; He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries [them] in the fold of His [garment]. He gently leads those that are nursing.
23Is 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand or marked off the heavens with the span [of his hand]? Who has gathered the dust of the earth in a measure or weighed the mountains in a balance and the hills in scales?
23Is 40:13 Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or who gave Him His counsel?
23Is 40:14 Who did He consult with? Who gave Him understanding and taught Him the paths of justice? Who taught Him knowledge and showed Him the way of understanding?
23Is 40:15 Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are considered as a speck of dust on the scales; He lifts up the islands like fine dust.
23Is 40:16 Lebanon is not enough for fuel, or its animals enough for a burnt offering.
23Is 40:17 All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are considered by Him as nothingness and emptiness.
23Is 40:18 Who will you compare God with? What likeness will you compare Him to?
23Is 40:19 To an idol?-- [something that] a smelter casts, and a metalworker plates with gold and makes silver welds [for it]?
23Is 40:20 To one who shapes a pedestal, choosing wood that does not rot? He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not fall over.
23Is 40:21 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not considered the foundations of the earth?
23Is 40:22 God is enthroned above the circle of the earth; its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like thin cloth and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
23Is 40:23 He reduces princes to nothing and makes the judges of the earth to be irrational.
23Is 40:24 They are barely planted, barely sown, their stem hardly takes root in the ground when He blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind carries them away like stubble.
23Is 40:25 "Who will you compare Me to, or who is My equal?" asks the Holy One.
23Is 40:26 Look up and see: who created these? He brings out the starry host by number; He calls all of them by name. Because of His great power and strength, not one of them is missing.
23Is 40:27 Jacob, why do you say, and Israel, why do you assert: "My way is hidden from the LORD, and my claim is ignored by my God"?
23Is 40:28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Yahweh is the everlasting God, the Creator of the whole earth. He never grows faint or weary; there is no limit to His understanding.
23Is 40:29 He gives strength to the weary and strengthens the powerless.
23Is 40:30 Youths may faint and grow weary, and young men stumble and fall,
23Is 40:31 but those who trust in the LORD will renew their strength; they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not faint.
23Is 41:1 "Be silent before Me, islands! And let peoples renew their strength. Let them approach, then let them testify; let us come together for the trial.
23Is 41:2 Who has stirred him up from the east? He calls righteousness to his feet. The LORD hands nations over to him, and he subdues kings. He makes [them] like dust [with] his sword, like wind-driven stubble [with] his bow.
23Is 41:3 He pursues them, going on safely, hardly touching the path with his feet.
23Is 41:4 Who has performed and done [this], calling the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD, am the first, and with the last-- I am He."
23Is 41:5 The islands see and are afraid, the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and arrive.
23Is 41:6 Each one helps the other, and says to another, "Take courage!"
23Is 41:7 The craftsman encourages the metalworker; the one who flattens with the hammer [supports] the one who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, "It is good." He fastens it with nails so that it will not fall over.
23Is 41:8 But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham, My friend--
23Is 41:9 I brought you from the ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I said to you: You are My servant; I have chosen you and not rejected you.
23Is 41:10 Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; I will help you; I will hold on to you with My righteous right hand.
23Is 41:11 Be sure that all who are enraged against you will be ashamed and disgraced; those who contend with you will become as nothing and will perish.
23Is 41:12 You will look for those who contend with you, but you will not find them. Those who war against you will become absolutely nothing.
23Is 41:13 For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand and say to you: Do not fear, I will help you.
23Is 41:14 Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel: I will help you-- the LORD's declaration. Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:15 See, I will make you into a sharp threshing board, new, with many teeth. You will thresh mountains and pulverize [them], and make hills like chaff.
23Is 41:16 You will winnow them and a wind will carry them away, and a gale will scatter them. But you will rejoice in the LORD; you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:17 The poor and the needy seek water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them; I, the God of Israel, do not forsake them.
23Is 41:18 I will open rivers on the barren heights, and springs in the middle of the plains. I will turn the desert into a pool of water and dry land into springs of water.
23Is 41:19 I will plant cedars in the desert, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees. I will put cypress trees in the desert, elms and box trees together,
23Is 41:20 so that all may see and know, consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23Is 41:21 "Submit your case," says the LORD. "Present your arguments," says Jacob's King.
23Is 41:22 "Let them come and tell us what will happen. Tell us the past events, so that we may reflect on it and know the outcome. Or tell us the future.
23Is 41:23 Tell us the coming events, then we will know that you are gods. Indeed, do [something] good or bad, then we will be in awe and perceive.
23Is 41:24 Look, you are nothing and your work is worthless. Anyone who chooses you is detestable.
23Is 41:25 "I have raised up one from the north, and he has come, one from the east who invokes My name. He will march over rulers as if they were mud, like a potter who treads the clay.
23Is 41:26 Who told about this from the beginning, so that we might know, and from times past, so that we might say: He is right? No one announced it, no one told it, no one heard your words.
23Is 41:27 I was the first to say to Zion: Look! Here they are! and I gave a herald of good news to Jerusalem.
23Is 41:28 When I look, there is no one; there is no counselor among them; when I ask them, they have nothing to say.
23Is 41:29 Look, all of them are a delusion; their works are nonexistent; their images are wind and emptiness.
23Is 42:1 "This is My Servant; I strengthen Him, [this is] My Chosen One; I delight in Him. I have put My Spirit on Him; He will bring justice to the nations.
23Is 42:2 He will not cry out or shout or make His voice heard in the streets.
23Is 42:3 He will not break a bruised reed, and He will not put out a smoldering wick; He will faithfully bring justice.
23Is 42:4 He will not grow weak or be discouraged until He has established justice on earth. The islands will wait for His instruction."
23Is 42:5 This is what God the LORD says-- who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who walk on it--
23Is 42:6 "I, the LORD, have called you for a righteous [purpose], and I will hold you by your hand. I will keep you, and I make you a covenant for the people [and] a light to the nations,
23Is 42:7 in order to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the dungeon, [and] those sitting in darkness from the prison house.
23Is 42:8 I am Yahweh, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, or my praise to idols.
23Is 42:9 The past events have indeed happened. Now I declare new events; I announce them to you before they occur."
23Is 42:10 Sing a new song to the LORD; [sing] His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea with all that fills it, you islands with your inhabitants.
23Is 42:11 Let the desert and its cities shout, the settlements where Kedar dwells [cry aloud]. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops.
23Is 42:12 Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare His praise in the islands.
23Is 42:13 The LORD advances like a warrior; He stirs up His zeal like a soldier. He shouts, He roars aloud, He prevails over His enemies.
23Is 42:14 "I have kept silent from ages past; I have been quiet and restrained Myself. [But now,] I will groan like a woman in labor, gasping breathlessly.
23Is 42:15 I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn rivers into islands, and dry up marshes.
23Is 42:16 I will lead the blind by a way they did not know; I will guide them on paths they have not known. I will turn darkness to light in front of them, and rough places into level ground. This is what I will do for them, and I will not forsake them.
23Is 42:17 They will be turned back [and] utterly ashamed-- those who trust in idols and say to metal-plated images: You are our gods!
23Is 42:18 "Listen, you deaf! Look, you blind, so that you may see.
23Is 42:19 Who is blind but My servant, or deaf like My messenger I am sending? Who is blind like [My] dedicated one, or blind like the servant of the LORD?
23Is 42:20 Though seeing many things, you do not obey. Though [his] ears are open, he does not listen."
23Is 42:21 The LORD was pleased, because of His righteousness, to magnify [His] instruction and make it glorious.
23Is 42:22 But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in holes or imprisoned in dungeons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them, and loot, with no one saying "Give [it] back!"
23Is 42:23 Who among you will pay attention to this? Let him listen and obey in the future.
23Is 42:24 Who gave Jacob to the robber, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD? Have we not sinned against Him? They were not willing to walk in His ways, and they would not listen to His instruction.
23Is 42:25 So He poured out on Jacob His furious anger and the power of war. It surrounded him with fire, but he did not know [it]; it burned him, but he paid no attention.
23Is 43:1 Now this is what the LORD says-- the One who created you, Jacob, and the One who formed you, Israel-- "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.
23Is 43:2 I will be with you when you pass through the waters, and [when you pass] through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. You will not be scorched when you walk through the fire, and the flame will not burn you.
23Is 43:3 For I the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, and your Savior, give Egypt as a ransom for you, Cush and Seba in your place.
23Is 43:4 Because you are precious in My sight and honored, and I love you, I will give human beings in your place, and peoples in place of your life.
23Is 43:5 Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your descendants from the east, and gather you from the west.
23Is 43:6 I will say to the north: Give [them] up! and to the south: Do not hold [them] back! Bring My sons from far away, and My daughters from the ends of the earth--
23Is 43:7 everyone called by My name and created for My glory. I have formed him; indeed, I have made him."
23Is 43:8 Bring out a people who are blind, yet have eyes, and are deaf, yet have ears.
23Is 43:9 All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled. Who among them can declare this, and tell us the former things? Let them present their witnesses to vindicate [themselves], so that people may hear and say, "It is true."
23Is 43:10 "You are My witnesses"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and My servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe Me and understand that I am He. No god was formed before Me, and there will be none after Me.
23Is 43:11 I, I am the LORD, and there is no other Savior but Me.
23Is 43:12 I alone declared, saved, and proclaimed-- and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and I am God.
23Is 43:13 Also, from today on I am He [alone], and no one can take [anything] from My hand. I act, and who can reverse it?"
23Is 43:14 This is what the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: Because of you, I will send to Babylon and bring all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans in the ships in which they rejoice.
23Is 43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
23Is 43:16 This is what the LORD says-- who makes a way in the sea, and a path through surging waters,
23Is 43:17 who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty one together (they lie down, they do not rise again; they are extinguished, quenched like a wick)--
23Is 43:18 "Do not remember the past events, pay no attention to things of old.
23Is 43:19 Look, I am about to do something new; even now it is coming. Do you not see it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.
23Is 43:20 The animals of the field will honor Me, jackals and ostriches, because I provide water in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My chosen people.
23Is 43:21 The people I formed for Myself will declare My praise.
23Is 43:22 "But Jacob, you have not called on Me, because, Israel, you have become weary of Me.
23Is 43:23 You have not brought Me your sheep for burnt offerings or honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings or wearied you with incense.
23Is 43:24 You have not bought Me aromatic cane with silver, or satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
23Is 43:25 "It is I who sweep away your transgressions for My own sake and remember your sins no more.
23Is 43:26 Take Me to court; let us argue our case together. State your [case], so that you may be vindicated.
23Is 43:27 Your first father sinned, and your mediators have rebelled against Me.
23Is 43:28 So I defiled the officers of the sanctuary, and gave Jacob over to total destruction and Israel to abuse.
23Is 44:1 "And now listen, Jacob My servant, Israel whom I have chosen.
23Is 44:2 This is the word of the LORD your Maker who shaped you from birth; He will help you: Do not fear; Jacob is My servant; I have chosen Jeshurun.
23Is 44:3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants and My blessing on your offspring.
23Is 44:4 They will sprout among the grass like poplars by the streambeds.
23Is 44:5 This one will say: I am the LORD's; another will call [himself] by the name of Jacob; still another will write on his hand: The LORD's, and name [himself] by the name of Israel."
23Is 44:6 This is what the LORD, the King of Israel and its Redeemer, the LORD of Hosts, says: I am the first and I am the last. There is no God but Me.
23Is 44:7 Who, like Me, can announce [the future]? Let him say so and make a case before Me, since I have established an ancient people. Let these gods declare the coming things, and what will take place.
23Is 44:8 Do not be startled or afraid. Have I not told you and declared it long ago? You are my witnesses! Is there any God but Me? There is no [other] Rock; I do not know any.
23Is 44:9 All who make idols are nothing, and what they treasure does not profit. Their witnesses do not see or know [anything], so they will be put to shame.
23Is 44:10 Who makes a god or casts a metal image for no profit?
23Is 44:11 Look, all its worshipers will be put to shame, and the craftsmen are humans. They all will assemble and stand; they all will be startled and put to shame.
23Is 44:12 The ironworker labors over the coals, shapes the idol with hammers, and works it with his strong arm. Also he grows hungry and his strength fails; he doesn't drink water and is faint.
23Is 44:13 The woodworker stretches out a measuring line, he outlines it with a stylus; he shapes it with chisels and outlines it with a compass. He makes it according to a human likeness, like a beautiful person, to dwell in a temple.
23Is 44:14 He cuts down cedars for his use, or he takes a cypress or an oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow.
23Is 44:15 It serves as fuel for man. He takes some of it and warms himself; also he kindles a fire and bakes bread; he even makes it into a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and bows down to it.
23Is 44:16 He burns half of it in a fire, and he roasts meat on that half. He eats the roast and is satisfied. He warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm, I see the blaze."
23Is 44:17 He makes a god or his idol with the rest of it. He bows down to it and worships; He prays to it, "Save me, for you are my god."
23Is 44:18 Such people do not comprehend and cannot understand, for He has shut their eyes so they cannot see, and their minds so they cannot understand.
23Is 44:19 No one reflects, no one has the perception or insight to say, "I burned half of it in the fire, I also baked bread on its coals, I roasted meat and ate. I will make something detestable with the rest of it, and I will bow down to a block of wood."
23Is 44:20 He feeds on ashes. [His] deceived mind has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself, or say, "Isn't there a lie in my right hand?"
23Is 44:21 Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, for you are My servant; I formed you, you are My servant; Israel, you will never be forgotten by Me.
23Is 44:22 I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.
23Is 44:23 Rejoice, heavens, for the LORD has acted; shout, depths of the earth. Break out into singing, mountains, forest, and every tree in it. For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorifies Himself through Israel.
23Is 44:24 This is what the LORD, your Redeemer who formed you from the womb, says: I am the LORD, who made everything; who stretched out the heavens by Myself; who alone spread out the earth;
23Is 44:25 who destroys the omens of the false prophets and makes fools of diviners; who confounds the wise and makes their knowledge foolishness;
23Is 44:26 who confirms the message of His servant and fulfills the counsel of His messengers; who says to Jerusalem: She will be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah: They will be rebuilt, and I will restore her ruins;
23Is 44:27 who says to the depths of the sea: Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;
23Is 44:28 who says to Cyrus: My shepherd, he will fulfill all My pleasure and say to Jerusalem: She will be rebuilt, and of the temple: Its foundation will be laid.
23Is 45:1 The LORD says this to Cyrus, His anointed, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him, to unloose the loins of kings, to open the doors before him and the gates will not be shut:
23Is 45:2 "I will go before you and level the uneven places; I will shatter the bronze doors and cut the iron bars in two.
23Is 45:3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and riches from secret places, so that you may know that I, the LORD, the God of Israel call you by your name.
23Is 45:4 I call you by your name, because of Jacob My servant and Israel My chosen one. I give a name to you, though you do not know Me.
23Is 45:5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God but Me. I will strengthen you, though you do not know Me,
23Is 45:6 so that all may know from the rising of the sun to its setting that there is no one but Me. I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:7 I form light and create darkness, I make success and create disaster; I, the LORD, do all these things.
23Is 45:8 "Heavens, sprinkle from above, and let the skies shower righteousness. Let the earth open up that salvation sprout and righteousness spring up with it. I, the LORD, have created it.
23Is 45:9 "Woe to the one who argues with his Maker-- one clay pot among many. Does clay say to the one forming it: What are you making? Or does your work [say]: He has no hands?
23Is 45:10 How absurd is the one who says to [his] father: What are you fathering? or to [his] mother: What are you giving birth to?"
23Is 45:11 This is what the LORD, the Holy One of Israel and its Maker, says: "Ask Me what is to happen to My sons, and instruct Me about the work of My hands.
23Is 45:12 I made the earth, and created man on it. It was My hands that stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host.
23Is 45:13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and will level all roads for him. He will rebuild My city, and set My exiles free, not for a price or a bribe," says the LORD of Hosts.
23Is 45:14 This is what the LORD says: The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you and will be yours; they will follow you, they will come over in chains; and bow down to you. They will confess to you: God is indeed with you, and there is no other; there is no other God.
23Is 45:15 Yes, You are a God who hides Himself, God of Israel, Savior.
23Is 45:16 All of them are put to shame, even humiliated; the makers of idols go in humiliation together.
23Is 45:17 Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will not be put to shame or humiliated for all eternity.
23Is 45:18 For this is what the LORD says-- God is the Creator of the heavens. He formed the earth and made it; He established it; He did not create it to be empty, [but] formed it to be inhabited-- "I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:19 I have not spoken in secret, somewhere in a land of darkness. I did not say to the descendants of Jacob: Seek Me in a wasteland. I, the LORD, speak truthfully; I say what is right.
23Is 45:20 "Come, gather together, and draw near, you fugitives of the nations. Those who carry their wooden idols, and pray to a god who cannot save, have no knowledge.
23Is 45:21 Speak up and present [your case]-- yes, let them take counsel together. Who predicted this long ago? Who announced it from ancient times? Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other God but Me, a righteous God and Savior; there is no one except Me.
23Is 45:22 Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth. For I am God, and there is no other.
23Is 45:23 By Myself I have sworn; Truth has gone from My mouth, a word that will not be revoked: Every knee will bow to Me, every tongue will swear allegiance.
23Is 45:24 It will be said to Me: Only in the LORD is righteousness and strength." All who are incensed against Him will come to Him and be put to shame.
23Is 45:25 All the descendants of Israel will be justified and find glory through the LORD.
23Is 46:1 Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. Their idols are consigned to beasts and cattle. The [images] you carry are loaded, as a burden for the weary [animal].
23Is 46:2 The gods cower; they crouch together; they are not able to rescue the burden, but they themselves go into captivity.
23Is 46:3 "Listen to Me, house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been sustained from the womb, carried along since birth.
23Is 46:4 I will be the same until [your] old age, and I will bear [you] up when you turn gray. I have made [you], and I will carry [you]; I will bear and save [you].
23Is 46:5 "Who will you compare Me or make Me equal to? Who will you measure Me with, so that we should be like each other?
23Is 46:6 Those who pour out their bags of gold and weigh out silver on a scales-- they hire a goldsmith and he makes it into a god. Then they kneel and bow down to it.
23Is 46:7 They lift it to their shoulder and bear it along; they set it in its place, and there it stands; it does not budge from its place. They cry out to it but it doesn't answer; it saves no one from his trouble.
23Is 46:8 "Remember this and be brave; take it to heart, you transgressors!
23Is 46:9 Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; [I am] God, and no one is like Me.
23Is 46:10 I declare the end from the beginning, and from long ago what is not yet done, saying: My plan will take place, and I will do all My will.
23Is 46:11 I call a bird of prey from the east, a man for My purpose from a far country. Yes, I have spoken; so I will also bring it about. I have planned it; I will also do it.
23Is 46:12 Listen to me, you hardhearted, far removed from justice:
23Is 46:13 I am bringing My justice near; it is not far away, and My salvation will not delay. I will put salvation in Zion, My splendor in Israel.
23Is 47:1 "Go down and sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter Chaldea! For you will no longer be called pampered and spoiled.
23Is 47:2 Take millstones and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off [your] skirt, bare your thigh, wade through the streams.
23Is 47:3 Your nakedness will be uncovered, and your shame will be exposed. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one.
23Is 47:4 The Holy One of Israel is our Redeemer; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
23Is 47:5 "Daughter Chaldea, sit in silence and go into darkness. For you will no longer be called mistress of kingdoms.
23Is 47:6 I was angry with My people; I profaned My possession, and I placed them under your control. You showed them no mercy; you made your yoke very heavy on the elderly.
23Is 47:7 You said: I will be the mistress forever. You did not take these things to heart or think about their outcome.
23Is 47:8 "So now hear this, lover of luxury, who sits securely, who says to herself: I, and no one else, will never be a widow or know the loss of children.
23Is 47:9 These two things will happen to you suddenly, in one day: loss of children and widowhood. They will happen to you in their entirety, in spite of your many sorceries and the potency of your spells.
23Is 47:10 You were secure in your wickedness; you said: No one sees me. Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray. You said to yourself: I, and no one else.
23Is 47:11 But disaster will happen to you; you will not know how to avert it. And it will fall on you, but you will be unable to ward it off. Devastation will happen to you suddenly and unexpectedly.
23Is 47:12 So take your stand with your spells and your many sorceries, which you have wearied yourself with from your youth. Perhaps you will be able to succeed; perhaps you will inspire terror!
23Is 47:13 You are worn out with your many consultations. So let them stand and save you-- the astrologers, who observe the stars, who predict monthly what will happen to you.
23Is 47:14 Look, they are like stubble; fire burns them up. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. This is not a coal for warming themselves, or a fire to sit beside!
23Is 47:15 This is what they are to you-- those who have wearied you and have traded with you from your youth-- each wanders on his own way; no one can save you.
23Is 48:1 "Listen to this, house of Jacob-- those who are called by the name Israel and have descended from Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD and declare the God of Israel, [but] not in truth or righteousness.
23Is 48:2 For they are named after the Holy City, and lean on the God of Israel; His name is Yahweh of Hosts.
23Is 48:3 I declared the past events long ago; they came out of My mouth; I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and they occurred.
23Is 48:4 Because I know that you are stubborn, and your neck is iron and your forehead bronze,
23Is 48:5 therefore I declared to you long ago; I announced it to you before it occurred, so you could not claim: My idol caused them; my carved image and cast idol control them.
23Is 48:6 You have heard it. Observe it all. Will you not acknowledge it? From now on I will announce new things to you, hidden things that you have not known.
23Is 48:7 They have been created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today, so you could not claim, "I already knew them!"
23Is 48:8 You have never heard; you have never known; For a long time your ears have not been open. For I knew that you were very treacherous, and were known as a rebel from birth.
23Is 48:9 I will delay My anger for the honor of My name, and I will restrain Myself for your benefit and [for] My praise, so that you will not be destroyed.
23Is 48:10 Look, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
23Is 48:11 I will act for My own sake, indeed, My own, for how can I be defiled? I will not give My glory to another.
23Is 48:12 "Listen to Me, Jacob, and Israel, the one called by Me: I am He; I am the first, I am also the last.
23Is 48:13 My own hand founded the earth, and My right hand spread out the heavens; when I summoned them, they stood up together.
23Is 48:14 All of you, assemble and listen! Who among the idols has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will accomplish His will against Babylon, and His arm [will be against] the Chaldeans.
23Is 48:15 I-- I have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he will succeed in his mission.
23Is 48:16 Approach Me and listen to this. From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time anything existed, I was there." And now the Lord God has sent me and His Spirit.
23Is 48:17 This is what the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: I am the LORD your God, who teaches you for [your] benefit, who leads you in the way you should go.
23Is 48:18 If only you had paid attention to My commands. Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
23Is 48:19 Your descendants would have been as [countless] as the sand, and the offspring of your body like its grains; their name would not be cut off or eliminated from My presence.
23Is 48:20 Leave Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans! Declare with a shout of joy, proclaim this, let it go out to the end of the earth; announce, "The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!"
23Is 48:21 They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He made water flow for them from the rock; He split the rock, and water gushed out.
23Is 48:22 "There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
23Is 49:1 Coastlands, listen to me; distant peoples, pay attention. The LORD called me before I was born. He named me while I was in my mother's womb.
23Is 49:2 He made my words like a sharp sword; He hid me in the shadow of His hand. He made me like a sharpened arrow; He hid me in His quiver.
23Is 49:3 He said to me, "You are My servant, Israel; I will be glorified in him."
23Is 49:4 But I myself said: I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and futility; yet my vindication is with the LORD, and my reward is with my God.
23Is 49:5 And now, says the LORD, who formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him so that Israel might be gathered to Him; for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and my God is my strength--
23Is 49:6 He says, "It is not enough for you to be My servant raising up the tribes of Jacob and restoring the protected ones of Israel. I will also make you a light for the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the earth."
23Is 49:7 This is what the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One says to one who is despised, to one abhorred by people, to a servant of rulers: "Kings will see and stand up, and princes will bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel-- and He has chosen you."
23Is 49:8 This is what the LORD says: I will answer you in a time of favor, and I will help you in the day of salvation. I will keep you, and I will appoint you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land, to make them possess the desolate inheritances,
23Is 49:9 saying to the prisoners: Come out, and to those who are in darkness: Show yourselves. They will feed along the pathways, and their pastures will be on all the barren heights.
23Is 49:10 They will not hunger or thirst, the scorching heat or sun will not strike them; for their compassionate One will guide them, and lead them to springs of water.
23Is 49:11 I will make all My mountains into a road, and My highways will be raised up.
23Is 49:12 See, these will come from far away, from the north and from the west, and from the land of Sinim.
23Is 49:13 Shout for joy, you heavens! Earth, rejoice! Mountains break into joyful shouts! For the LORD has comforted His people, and will have compassion on His afflicted ones.
23Is 49:14 Zion says, "The LORD has abandoned me; The Lord has forgotten me!"
23Is 49:15 "Can a woman forget her nursing child, or lack compassion for the child of her womb? Even if these forget, yet I will not forget you.
23Is 49:16 Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; your walls are continually before Me.
23Is 49:17 Your builders hurry; those who destroy and devastate you will leave you.
23Is 49:18 Look up, and look around. They all gather together; they come to you. As I live"-- the LORD's declaration-- "you will wear all your children as jewelry, and put them on as a bride does.
23Is 49:19 For your waste and desolate places and your land marked by ruins-- will now be indeed too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
23Is 49:20 The children that you have been deprived of will yet say in your hearing: This place is too small for me; make room for me so that I may settle.
23Is 49:21 Then you will say within yourself: Who fathered these for me? I was deprived of my children and barren, exiled and wandering-- but who brought them up? See, I was left by myself-- but these, where did they come from?"
23Is 49:22 This is what the Lord God says: Look, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and raise My banner to the peoples. They will bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.
23Is 49:23 Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground, and lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who put their hope in Me will not be put to shame.
23Is 49:24 Can the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of the righteous be delivered?
23Is 49:25 For this is what the LORD says: "Even the captives of a mighty man will be taken, and the prey of a tyrant will be delivered; I will contend with the one who contends with you, and I will save your children.
23Is 49:26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, and they will be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine. Then all flesh will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
23Is 50:1 This is what the LORD says: Where is your mother's divorce certificate that I used to send her away? Or who were My creditors that I sold you to? Look, you were sold for your iniquities, and your mother was put away because of your transgressions.
23Is 50:2 Why was no one there when I came? Why was there no one to answer when I called? Is My hand too short to redeem? Or do I have no power to deliver? Look, I dry up the sea by My rebuke; I turn the rivers into a wilderness; their fish rot because of lack of water and die of thirst.
23Is 50:3 I dress the heavens in black and make sackcloth their clothing.
23Is 50:4 The Lord God has given Me the tongue of those who are instructed to know how to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens [Me] each morning; He awakens My ear to listen like those being instructed.
23Is 50:5 The Lord God has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious; I did not turn back.
23Is 50:6 I gave My back to those who beat Me, and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. I did not hide My face from scorn and spitting.
23Is 50:7 The Lord God will help Me; therefore I have not been humiliated; therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.
23Is 50:8 The One who justifies Me is near; who will contend with Me? Let us confront each other. Who has a case against Me? Let him come near Me!
23Is 50:9 In truth, the Lord God will help Me; who is he who will condemn Me? Indeed, all of them will wear out like a garment; a moth will devour them.
23Is 50:10 Who among you fears the LORD, listening to the voice of His servant? Who [among you] walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD; let him lean on his God.
23Is 50:11 Look, all you who kindle a fire, who encircle yourselves with firebrands; walk in the light of your fire and in the firebrands you have lit! This is what you'll get from My hand: you will lie down in a place of torment.
23Is 51:1 Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the quarry from which you were dug.
23Is 51:2 Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain. When I called him, he was only one; I blessed him and made him many.
23Is 51:3 For the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places, and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and melodious song.
23Is 51:4 Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation; for instruction will come from Me, and My justice for a light to the nations. I will bring it about quickly.
23Is 51:5 My righteousness is near, My salvation appears, and My arms will bring justice to the nations. The coastlands will put their hope in Me, and they will look to My strength.
23Is 51:6 Look up to the heavens, and look at the earth beneath; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its inhabitants will die in like manner. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will never be shattered.
23Is 51:7 Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My instruction: do not fear disgrace by men, and do not be shattered by their taunts.
23Is 51:8 For the moth will devour them like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will last forever, and My salvation for all generations.
23Is 51:9 Wake up, wake up! Put on the strength of the LORD's power. Wake up as in days past, as in generations of long ago. Wasn't it You who hacked Rahab to pieces, who pierced the sea monster?
23Is 51:10 Wasn't it You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made the sea-bed into a road for the redeemed to pass over?
23Is 51:11 And the ransomed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake [them], and sorrow and sighing will flee.
23Is 51:12 I-- I am the One who comforts you. Who are you that you should fear man who dies, or a son of man who is given up like grass?
23Is 51:13 But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You are in constant dread all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, who has set himself to destroy. But where is the fury of the oppressor?
23Is 51:14 The prisoner is soon to be set free; he will not die [and go] to the Pit, and his food will not be lacking.
23Is 51:15 For I am the LORD your God who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar-- His name is Yahweh of Hosts.
23Is 51:16 I have put My words in your mouth, and covered you in the shadow of My hand, in order to plant the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, "You are My people."
23Is 51:17 Wake yourself, wake yourself up! Stand up, Jerusalem, you who have drunk the cup of His fury from the hand of the LORD; you who have drunk the goblet to the dregs-- the cup that [causes people] to stagger.
23Is 51:18 There is no one to guide her among all the children she has raised; there is no one to take hold of her hand among all the offspring she has brought up.
23Is 51:19 These two things have happened to you: devastation and destruction, famine and sword. Who will grieve for you? How can I comfort you?
23Is 51:20 Your children have fainted; they lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net. They are full of the LORD's fury, the rebuke of your God.
23Is 51:21 So listen to this, afflicted and drunken one-- but not with wine.
23Is 51:22 This is what your Lord says-- Yahweh, even your God, who defends His people-- "Look, I have removed the cup of staggering from your hand; that goblet, the cup of My fury. You will never drink it again.
23Is 51:23 I will put it into the hands of your tormenters, who said to you: Lie down, so we can walk over you. You made your back like the ground, and like a street for those who walk on it.
23Is 52:1 "Wake up, wake up; put on your strength, Zion! Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the Holy City! For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer enter you.
23Is 52:2 Stand up, shake the dust off yourself! Take your seat, Jerusalem. Remove the bonds from your neck, captive Daughter Zion."
23Is 52:3 For this is what the LORD says: "You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without silver."
23Is 52:4 For this is what the Lord God says: "At first My people went down to Egypt to live there, then Assyria oppressed them without cause.
23Is 52:5 So now what have I here"-- the LORD's declaration-- "that My people are taken away for nothing? Its rulers wail"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.
23Is 52:6 Therefore My people will know My name; therefore [they will know] on that day that I am He who says: Here I am."
23Is 52:7 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace, who brings news of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"
23Is 52:8 The voices of your watchmen-- they lift up their voices, shouting for joy together; for every eye will see when the LORD returns to Zion.
23Is 52:9 Be joyful, rejoice together, you ruins of Jerusalem! For the LORD has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.
23Is 52:10 The LORD has displayed His holy arm in the sight of all the nations; all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
23Is 52:11 Leave, leave, go out from there! Do not touch anything unclean; go out from her, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
23Is 52:12 For you will not leave in a hurry, and you will not have to take flight; because the LORD is going before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard.
23Is 52:13 See, My servant will act wisely; He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted.
23Is 52:14 Just as many were appalled at You-- His appearance was so disfigured that He did not look like a man, and His form did not resemble a human being--
23Is 52:15 so He will sprinklemany nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him, For they will see what had not been told them, and they will understand what they had not heard.
23Is 53:1 Who has believed what we have heard? And who has the arm of the LORD been revealed to?
23Is 53:2 He grew up before Him like a young plant and like a root out of dry ground. He had no form or splendor that we should look at Him, no appearance that we should desire Him.
23Is 53:3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering who knew what sickness was. He was like one people turned away from; He was despised, and we didn't value Him.
23Is 53:4 Yet He Himself bore our sicknesses, and He carried our pains; but we in turn regarded Him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted.
23Is 53:5 But He was pierced because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; punishment for our peace was on Him, and we are healed by His wounds.
23Is 53:6 We all went astray like sheep; we all have turned to our own way; and the LORD has punished Him for the iniquity of us all.
23Is 53:7 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth. Like a lamb led to the slaughter and like a sheep silent before her shearers, He did not open His mouth.
23Is 53:8 He was taken away because of oppression and judgment; and who considered His fate? For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was struck because of My people's rebellion.
23Is 53:9 They made His grave with the wicked, and with a rich man at His death, although He had done no violence and had not spoken deceitfully.
23Is 53:10 Yet the LORD was pleased to crush Him, and He made Him sick. When You make Him a restitution offering, He will see [His] seed, He will prolong His days, and the will of the LORD will succeed by His hand.
23Is 53:11 He will see [it] out of His anguish, and He will be satisfied with His knowledge. My righteous servant will justify many, and He will carry their iniquities.
23Is 53:12 Therefore I will give Him the many as a portion, and He will receive the mighty as spoil, because He submitted Himself to death, and was counted among the rebels; yet He bore the sin of many and interceded for the rebels.
23Is 54:1 "Rejoice, barren one, who did not give birth; burst into song and shout, you who have not been in labor! For the children of the forsaken one will be more than the children of the married woman," says the LORD.
23Is 54:2 "Enlarge the site of your tent, and let your tent curtains be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your ropes, and drive your pegs deep.
23Is 54:3 For you will spread out to the right and to the left, and your descendants will dispossess nations and inhabit the desolate cities.
23Is 54:4 "Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame; don't be humiliated, for you will not be disgraced. For you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.
23Is 54:5 For your husband is your Maker-- His name is Yahweh of Hosts-- and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; He is called the God of all the earth.
23Is 54:6 For the LORD has called you, like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit, a wife of one's youth when she is rejected," says your God.
23Is 54:7 "I deserted you for a brief moment, but I will take you back with great compassion.
23Is 54:8 In a surge of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, but I will have compassion on you with everlasting love," says the LORD your Redeemer.
23Is 54:9 "For this is like the days of Noah to Me: when I swore that the waters of Noah would never flood the earth again, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.
23Is 54:10 Though the mountains move and the hills shake, My love will not be removed from you and My covenant of peace will not be shaken," says your compassionate LORD.
23Is 54:11 "Poor [Jerusalem], storm-tossed, and not comforted, I will set your stones in black mortar, and lay your foundations in sapphires.
23Is 54:12 I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling stones, and all your walls of precious stones.
23Is 54:13 Then all your children will be taught by the LORD, their prosperity will be great,
23Is 54:14 and you will be established on [a foundation of] righteousness. You will be far from oppression, you will certainly not be afraid; you will be far from terror, it will certainly not come near you.
23Is 54:15 If anyone attacks you, it is not from Me; whoever attacks you will fall before you.
23Is 54:16 Look, I have created the craftsman who blows on the charcoal fire and produces a weapon suitable for its task; and I have created the destroyer to work havoc.
23Is 54:17 No weapon formed against you will succeed, and you will refute any accusation raised against you in court. This is the heritage of the LORD's servants, and their righteousness is from Me." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
23Is 55:1 "Come, everyone who is thirsty, come to the waters; and you without money, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost!
23Is 55:2 Why do you spend money on what is not food, and your wages on what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and you will enjoy the choicest of foods.
23Is 55:3 Pay attention and come to Me; listen, so that you will live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the promises assured to David.
23Is 55:4 Since I have made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples,
23Is 55:5 so you will summon a nation you do not know, and nations who do not know you will run to you. For the LORD your God, even the Holy One of Israel, has glorified you."
23Is 55:6 Seek the LORD while He may be found; call to Him while He is near.
23Is 55:7 Let the wicked one abandon his way, and the sinful one his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, so He may have compassion on him, and to our God, for He will freely forgive.
23Is 55:8 "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not My ways." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
23Is 55:9 "For as heaven is higher than earth, so My ways are higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.
23Is 55:10 For just as rain and snow fall from heaven, and do not return there without saturating the earth, and making it germinate and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,
23Is 55:11 so My word that comes from My mouth will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please, and will prosper in what I send it [to do]."
23Is 55:12 You will indeed go out with joy and be peacefully guided; the mountains and the hills will break into singing before you, and all the trees of the field will clap [their] hands.
23Is 55:13 Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will come up, and instead of the brier, a myrtle will come up; it will make a name for the LORD as an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed.
23Is 56:1 This is what the LORD says: Preserve justice and do what is right, for My salvation is coming soon, and My righteousness will be revealed.
23Is 56:2 Happy is the man who does this, anyone who maintains this, who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
23Is 56:3 No foreigner who has converted to the LORD should say, "The LORD will exclude me from His people"; and the eunuch should not say, "Look, I am a dried-up tree."
23Is 56:4 For the LORD says this: "For the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold firmly to My covenant,
23Is 56:5 I will give them, in My house and within My walls, a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters. I will give each [of them] an everlasting name that will never be cut off.
23Is 56:6 And the foreigners who convert to the LORD, minister to Him, love the LORD's name, and are His servants, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it, and who hold firmly to My covenant--
23Is 56:7 I will bring them to My holy mountain and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations."
23Is 56:8 [This is] the declaration of the Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: "I will gather to them still others besides those already gathered."
23Is 56:9 All you animals of the field and forest, come and eat!
23Is 56:10 Israel's watchmen are blind, all of them, they know nothing; all of them are mute dogs, they cannot bark; they dream, lie down, and love to sleep.
23Is 56:11 These dogs have fierce appetites; they never have enough. And they are shepherds who have no discernment; all of them turn to their own way, every last one for his own gain.
23Is 56:12 "Come, let me get [some] wine, let's guzzle [some] beer; and tomorrow will be like today, only far better!"
23Is 57:1 The righteous one perishes, and no one takes it to heart; faithful men are swept away, with no one realizing that the righteous one is swept away from the presence of evil.
23Is 57:2 He will enter into peace-- they will rest on their beds-- everyone who lives uprightly.
23Is 57:3 But come here, you sons of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute!
23Is 57:4 Who is it you are mocking? Who is it you are opening your mouth and sticking out your tongue at? Isn't it you, you rebellious children, you race of liars,
23Is 57:5 who burn with lust among the oaks, under every flourishing tree, who slaughter children in the wadis below the clefts of the rocks?
23Is 57:6 Your portion is among the smooth [stones] of the wadi; indeed, they are your lot. You have even poured out a drink offering to them; you have offered a grain offering; should I be satisfied with these?
23Is 57:7 You have placed your bed on a high and lofty mountain; you also went up there to offer sacrifice.
23Is 57:8 You have set up your memorial behind the door and doorpost. For away from Me, you stripped, went up, and made your bed wide, and you have made a bargain for yourself with them. You have loved their bed; you have gazed on their genitals.
23Is 57:9 You went to the king with oil and multiplied your perfumes; you sent your envoys far away and sent [them] down even to Sheol.
23Is 57:10 You became weary on your many journeys, [but] you did not say, "I give up!" You found a renewal of your strength; therefore you did not grow weak.
23Is 57:11 Who was it you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and didn't remember Me or take it to heart? Have I not kept silent for such a long time and you do not fear Me?
23Is 57:12 I will expose your righteousness, and your works-- they will not profit you.
23Is 57:13 When you cry out, let your collection [of idols] deliver you! The wind will carry all of them off, a breath will take them away. But whoever takes refuge in Me will inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.
23Is 57:14 He said, "Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, remove [every] obstacle from My people's way."
23Is 57:15 For the High and Exalted One who lives forever, whose name is Holy says this: "I live in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the oppressed.
23Is 57:16 For I will not accuse [you] forever, and I will not always be angry; for then the spirit would grow weak before Me, even the breath [of man], which I have made.
23Is 57:17 Because of his sinful greed I was angry, so I struck him; I was angry and hid; but he went on turning back to the desires of his heart.
23Is 57:18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will lead him and comfort him and his mourners,
23Is 57:19 creating words of praise." The LORD says, "Peace, peace to the one who is far or near, and I will heal him.
23Is 57:20 But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its waters churn up mire and muck.
23Is 57:21 There is no peace for the wicked," says my God.
23Is 58:1 "Cry out loudly, don't hold back! Raise your voice like a trumpet. Tell My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
23Is 58:2 They seek Me day after day and delight to know My ways, like a nation that does what is right and does not abandon the justice of their God. They ask Me for righteous judgments; they delight in the nearness of God."
23Is 58:3 "Why have we fasted, but You have not seen? We have denied ourselves, but You haven't noticed!" "Look, you do as you please on the day of your fast, and oppress all your workers.
23Is 58:4 You fast [with] contention and strife to strike viciously with [your] fist. You cannot fast as [you do] today, [hoping] to make your voice heard on high.
23Is 58:5 Will the fast I choose be like this: A day for a person to deny himself, to bow his head like a reed, and to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD?
23Is 58:6 Isn't the fast I choose: To break the chains of wickedness, to untie the ropes of the yoke, to set the oppressed free, and to tear off every yoke?
23Is 58:7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, to bring the poor and homeless into your house, to clothe the naked when you see him, and to not ignore your own flesh [and blood]?
23Is 58:8 Then your light will appear like the dawn, and your recovery will come quickly. Your righteousness will go before you, and the LORD's glory will be your rear guard.
23Is 58:9 At that time, when you call, the LORD will answer; when you cry out, He will say: Here I am. If you get rid of the yoke from those around you, the finger-pointing and malicious speaking,
23Is 58:10 and if you offer yourself to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted one, then your light will shine in the darkness, and your night will be like noonday.
23Is 58:11 The LORD will always lead you, satisfy you in a parched land, and strengthen your bones. You will be like a watered garden and like a spring whose waters never run dry.
23Is 58:12 Some of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will restore the foundations laid long ago; you will be called the repairer of broken walls, the restorer of streets where people live.
23Is 58:13 "If you keep from desecrating the Sabbath, from doing whatever you want on My holy day; if you call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy [day] of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, seeking your own pleasure, or talking too much;
23Is 58:14 then you will delight yourself in the LORD, and I will make you ride over the heights of the land, and let you enjoy the heritage of your father Jacob." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23Is 59:1 Indeed, the LORD's hand is not too short to save, and His ear is not too deaf to hear.
23Is 59:2 But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God, and your sins have made Him hide [His] face from you so that He does not listen.
23Is 59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and you mutter injustice.
23Is 59:4 No one makes claims justly; no one pleads honestly. They trust in empty and worthless words; they conceive trouble and give birth to iniquity.
23Is 59:5 They hatch viper's eggs and weave spider's webs. Whoever eats their eggs will die; crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
23Is 59:6 Their webs cannot become clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their works are sinful works, and violent acts are in their hands.
23Is 59:7 Their feet run after evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; ruin and wretchedness are in their paths.
23Is 59:8 They have not known the path of peace, and there is no justice in their ways. They have made their roads crooked; no one who walks on them will know peace.
23Is 59:9 Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but there is darkness; for brightness, but we live in the night.
23Is 59:10 We grope along a wall like the blind; we grope like those without eyes. We stumble at noon as though it were twilight; [we are] like the dead among those who are healthy.
23Is 59:11 We all growl like bears and moan like doves. We hope for justice, but there is none; for salvation, [but] it is far from us.
23Is 59:12 For our transgressions have multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities:
23Is 59:13 transgression and deception against the LORD, turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart.
23Is 59:14 Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands far off. For truth has stumbled in the public square, and honesty cannot enter.
23Is 59:15 Truth is missing, and whoever turns from evil is plundered. The LORD saw that there was no justice, and He was offended.
23Is 59:16 He saw that there was no man-- He was amazed that there was no one interceding; so His own arm brought salvation, and His own righteousness supported Him.
23Is 59:17 He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and He wrapped Himself in zeal as in a cloak.
23Is 59:18 Thus He will repay according to [their] deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and He will repay the coastlands.
23Is 59:19 They will fear the name of the LORD in the west, and His glory in the east; for He will come like a rushing stream driven by the wind of the LORD.
23Is 59:20 The Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
23Is 59:21 "As for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD: "My Spirit who is on you, and My words that I have put in your mouth, will not depart from your mouth, or from the mouth of your children, or from the mouth of your children's children, from now on and forever," says the LORD.
23Is 60:1 Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD shines over you.
23Is 60:2 For look, darkness covers the earth, and total darkness the peoples; but the LORD will shine over you, and His glory will appear over you.
23Is 60:3 Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your radiance.
23Is 60:4 Raise your eyes and look around: they all gather and come to you; your sons will come from far away, and your daughters will be carried on the hip.
23Is 60:5 Then you will see and be radiant, and your heart will tremble and rejoice, because the riches of the sea will become yours, and the wealth of the nations will come to you.
23Is 60:6 Caravans of camels will cover your land-- young camels of Midian and Ephah-- all of them will come from Sheba. They will carry gold and frankincense and proclaim the praises of the LORD.
23Is 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you and go up on My altar as an acceptable [sacrifice]. I will glorify My beautiful house.
23Is 60:8 Who are these who fly like a cloud, like doves to their shelters?
23Is 60:9 Yes, the islands will wait for Me with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your children from far away, their silver and gold with them, for the honor of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.
23Is 60:10 Foreigners will build up your walls, and their kings will serve you. Although I struck you in My wrath, yet I will show mercy to you with My favor.
23Is 60:11 Your gates will always be open; they will never be shut day or night so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you, with their kings being led [in procession].
23Is 60:12 For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve you will perish; those nations will be annihilated.
23Is 60:13 The glory of Lebanon will come to you-- [its] pine, fir, and cypress together-- to beautify the place of My sanctuary, and I will glorify My dwelling place.
23Is 60:14 The sons of your oppressors will come and bow down to you; all who reviled you will fall down on their faces at your feet. They will call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 60:15 Instead of your being deserted and hated, with no one passing through, I will make you an object of eternal pride, a joy from age to age.
23Is 60:16 You will nurse on the milk of nations, and nurse at the breast of kings; you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23Is 60:17 I will bring gold instead of bronze; I will bring silver instead of iron, bronze instead of wood, and iron instead of stones. I will appoint peace as your guard and righteousness as your ruler.
23Is 60:18 Violence will never again be heard of in your land; devastation and destruction [will be gone from] your borders. But you will name your walls salvation, and your gates praise.
23Is 60:19 The sun will no longer be your light by day, and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you; but the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor.
23Is 60:20 Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not fade; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will be over.
23Is 60:21 Then all your people will be righteous; they will possess the land forever; they are the branch I planted, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.
23Is 60:22 The least will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; I will accomplish it quickly in its time.
23Is 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord God is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and freedom to the prisoners;
23Is 61:2 to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of our God's vengeance; to comfort all who mourn,
23Is 61:3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion; to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, festive oil instead of mourning, and splendid clothes instead of despair. And they will be called righteous trees, planted by the LORD, to glorify Him.
23Is 61:4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the former devastations; they will renew the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
23Is 61:5 Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
23Is 61:6 But you will be called the LORD's priests; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their riches.
23Is 61:7 Because your shame was double, and they cried out, "Disgrace is their portion," therefore, they will possess double in their land, and eternal joy will be theirs.
23Is 61:8 For I the LORD love justice; I hate robbery and injustice; I will faithfully reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.
23Is 61:9 Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their posterity among the peoples. All who see them will recognize that they are a people the LORD has blessed.
23Is 61:10 I greatly rejoice in the LORD, I exult in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom wears a turban and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23Is 61:11 For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
23Is 62:1 I will not keep silent because of Zion, and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem until her righteousness shines like a bright light, and her salvation like a flaming torch.
23Is 62:2 Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that the LORD's mouth will announce.
23Is 62:3 You will be a glorious crown in the LORD's hand, and a royal diadem in the palm of your God.
23Is 62:4 You will no longer be called Deserted, and your land will not be called Desolate; instead, you will be called My Delight is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land will be married.
23Is 62:5 For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you; and as a bridegroom rejoices over [his] bride, so your God will rejoice over you.
23Is 62:6 Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen on your walls; they will never be silent, day or night. You, who remind the LORD, no rest for you!
23Is 62:7 Do not give Him rest until He establishes and makes her Jerusalem the praise of the earth.
23Is 62:8 The LORD has sworn with His right hand and His strong arm: I will no longer give your grain to your enemies for food, and foreigners will not drink your new wine you have labored for.
23Is 62:9 For those who gather grain will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who harvest the grapes will drink [the wine] in My holy courts.
23Is 62:10 Go out, go out through the gates; prepare a way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones! Raise a banner for the peoples.
23Is 62:11 Look, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, "Say to Daughter Zion: Look, your salvation is coming, His reward is with Him, and His recompense is before Him."
23Is 62:12 And they will be called the Holy People, the LORD's Redeemed; and you will be called Cared For, A City Not Deserted.
23Is 63:1 Who is this coming from Edom in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah-- this One who is splendid in His apparel, rising up proudly in His great might? It is I, proclaiming vindication, powerful to save.
23Is 63:2 Why is Your clothing red, and Your garments like one who treads a winepress?
23Is 63:3 I trampled the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with Me. I trampled them in My anger and ground them underfoot in My fury; their blood spattered My garments, and all My clothes were stained.
23Is 63:4 For I planned the day of vengeance, and the year of My redemption came.
23Is 63:5 I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was amazed that no one assisted; so My arm accomplished victory for Me, and My wrath assisted Me.
23Is 63:6 I crushed nations in My anger; I made them drunk with My wrath and poured out their blood on the ground.
23Is 63:7 I will make known the LORD's faithful love [and] the LORD's praiseworthy acts, because of all the LORD has done for us-- even the many good things [He has done] for the house of Israel and has done for them based on His compassions and the abundance of His faithful love.
23Is 63:8 He said, "They are indeed My people, children who will not be disloyal," and He became their Savior.
23Is 63:9 In all their suffering, He suffered, and the Angel of His Presence saved them. He redeemed them because of His love and compassion; He lifted them up and carried them all the days of the past.
23Is 63:10 But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He became their enemy [and] fought against them.
23Is 63:11 Then He remembered the days of the past, [the days] of Moses [and] his people. Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit among the flock?
23Is 63:12 He sent His glorious arm at Moses' right hand, divided the waters before them to obtain eternal fame for Himself,
23Is 63:13 and led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble.
23Is 63:14 Like cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. You led Your people this way to make a glorious name for Yourself.
23Is 63:15 Look down from heaven and see from Your lofty home-- holy and beautiful. Where is Your zeal and Your might? Your yearning and Your compassion are withheld from me.
23Is 63:16 Yet You are our Father, even though Abraham does not know us and Israel doesn't recognize us. You, LORD, are our Father; from ancient times, Your name is our Redeemer.
23Is 63:17 Why, LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways? You harden our hearts so we do not fear You. Return, because of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
23Is 63:18 Your holy people had a possession for a little while, [but] our enemies have trampled down Your sanctuary.
23Is 63:19 We have become like those You never ruled over, like those not called by Your name.
23Is 64:1  If only You would tear the heavens open [and] come down, so that mountains would quake at Your presence--
23Is 64:2 as fire kindles the brushwood, and fire causes water to boil-- to make Your name known to Your enemies, so that nations will tremble at Your presence!
23Is 64:3 When You did awesome deeds that we did not expect, You came down, and the mountains quaked at Your presence.
23Is 64:4 From ancient times no one has heard, no one has listened, no eye has seen any God except You, who acts on behalf of the one who waits for Him.
23Is 64:5 You welcome the one who joyfully does what is right; they remember You in Your ways. But we have sinned, and You were angry; we will remain in Your ways and be saved.
23Is 64:6 All of us have become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like a polluted garment; all of us wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.
23Is 64:7 No one calls on Your name, striving to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us and made us melt because ofour iniquity.
23Is 64:8 Yet LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our potter; we all are the work of Your hands.
23Is 64:9 LORD, do not be terribly angry or remember [our] iniquity forever. Please look-- all of us are Your people!
23Is 64:10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
23Is 64:11 Our holy and beautiful temple, where our fathers praised You, has been burned with fire, and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.
23Is 64:12 LORD, after all this, will You restrain Yourself? Will You keep silent and afflict severely?
23Is 65:1 "I was sought by those who did not ask; I was found by those who did not seek Me. I said: Here I am, here I am, to a nation that was not called by My name.
23Is 65:2 I spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people who walk in the wrong path, following their own thoughts.
23Is 65:3 These people continually provoke Me to My face, sacrificing in gardens, burning incense on bricks,
23Is 65:4 sitting among the graves, spending nights in secret places, eating swine's flesh, and putting polluted broth in their bowls.
23Is 65:5 They say: Keep to yourself, don't come near me, for I am too holy for you! These practices are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.
23Is 65:6 It is written before Me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will repay them fully
23Is 65:7 [for] your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together," says the LORD. "Because they burned incense on the mountains and reproached Me on the hills, I will reward them fully for their former deeds."
23Is 65:8 The LORD says this: As the new wine is found in a bunch of grapes, and one says: Don't destroy it, for there's some good in it, so I will act because of My servants and not destroy them all.
23Is 65:9 I will produce descendants from Jacob, and heirs to My mountains from Judah; My chosen ones will possess it, and My servants will dwell there.
23Is 65:10 Sharon will be a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for cattle to lie down, for My people who have sought Me.
23Is 65:11 But you who abandon the LORD, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
23Is 65:12 I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will kneel down to be slaughtered, because I called and you did not answer, I spoke and you did not hear; you did what was evil in My sight and chose what I did not delight in.
23Is 65:13 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: My servants will eat, but you will be hungry; My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty; My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
23Is 65:14 My servants will shout for joy from a glad heart, but you will cry out from an anguished heart, and you will lament out of a broken spirit.
23Is 65:15 You will leave your name behind as a curse for My chosen ones, and the Lord God will kill you; but He will give His servants another name.
23Is 65:16 Whoever is blessed in the land will be blessed by the God of truth, and whoever swears in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the former troubles will be forgotten and hidden from My sight.
23Is 65:17 "For I will create a new heaven and a new earth; the past events will not be remembered or come to mind.
23Is 65:18 Then be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating; for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy, and its people to be a delight.
23Is 65:19 I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people. The sound of weeping and crying will no longer be heard in her.
23Is 65:20 In her, a nursing infant will no longer live only a few days, or an old man not live out his days. Indeed, the youth will die at a hundred years, and the one who misses a hundred years will be cursed.
23Is 65:21 People will build houses and live [in them]; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 65:22 They will not build and others live [in them]; they will not plant and others eat. For My people's lives will be like the lifetime of a tree. My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.
23Is 65:23 They will not labor without success or bear children [destined] for disaster, for they will be a people blessed by the LORD along with their descendants.
23Is 65:24 Even before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will hear.
23Is 65:25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but the serpent's food will be dust! They will not do what is evil or destroy on My entire holy mountain," says the LORD.
23Is 66:1 This is what the LORD says: Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house could you possibly build for Me? And what place could be My home?
23Is 66:2 My hand made all these things, and so they all came into being. [This is] the LORD's declaration. I will look favorably on this kind of person: one who is humble, submissive in spirit, and who trembles at My word.
23Is 66:3 One slaughters an ox, one kills a man; one sacrifices a lamb, one breaks a dog's neck; one offers a grain offering, one offers swine's blood; one offers incense, one praises an idol-- all these have chosen their ways and delight in their abominations.
23Is 66:4 So I will choose their punishment, and I will bring on them what they dread, because I called and no one answered; I spoke and they didn't hear; they did what is evil in My sight and chose what I didn't delight in.
23Is 66:5 You who tremble at His word, hear the word of the LORD: "Your brothers who hate and exclude you because of Me have said: Let the LORD be glorified, so that we can see your joy! But they will be put to shame."
23Is 66:6 A sound of uproar from the city! A voice from the temple-- the voice of the LORD, paying back His enemies what they deserve!
23Is 66:7 Before Zion was in labor, she gave birth; before she was in pain, she delivered a boy.
23Is 66:8 Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? Can a land be born in one day, or a nation be delivered in an instant? Yet as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her sons.
23Is 66:9 "Will I bring a baby to the point of birth and not deliver [it]?" says the LORD; "or will I who deliver, close [the womb]?" says your God.
23Is 66:10 Be glad for Jerusalem and rejoice over her, all who love her. Rejoice greatly with her, all who mourn over her--
23Is 66:11 so that you may nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breast and drink deeply and delight yourselves from her glorious breasts.
23Is 66:12 For this is what the LORD says: I will make peace flow to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flood; you will nurse and be carried on [her] hip, and bounced on [her] lap.
23Is 66:13 As a mother comforts her son, so I will comfort you, and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.
23Is 66:14 You will see, you will rejoice, and you will flourish like grass; then the LORD's power will be revealed to His servants, but He will show His wrath against His enemies.
23Is 66:15 Look, the LORD will come with fire-- His chariots are like the whirlwind-- to execute His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.
23Is 66:16 For the LORD will execute judgment on all flesh with His fiery sword, and many will be slain by the LORD.
23Is 66:17 "Those who dedicate and purify themselves to [enter] the groves following their leader, eating meat from pigs, vermin, and rats, will perish together." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
23Is 66:18 "Knowing their works and their thoughts, I have come to gather all nations and languages; they will come and see My glory.
23Is 66:19 I will establish a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations-- to Tarshish, Put, Lud (who are archers), Tubal, Javan, and the islands far away-- who have not heard of My fame or seen My glory. And they will proclaim My glory among the nations.
23Is 66:20 They will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a gift to the LORD on horses and chariots, in litters, and on mules and camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
23Is 66:21 I will also take some of them as priests and Levites," says the LORD.
23Is 66:22 "For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will endure before Me"-- the LORD's declaration-- "so will your offspring and your name endure.
23Is 66:23 All mankind will come to worship Me, from one New Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another," says the LORD.
23Is 66:24 "As they leave, they will see the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their maggots will never die, their fire will never go out, and they will be a horror to all mankind."
