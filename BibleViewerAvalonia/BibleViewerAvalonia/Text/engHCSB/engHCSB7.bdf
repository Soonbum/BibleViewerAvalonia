44Ac 1:1 I wrote the first narrative, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach
44Ac 1:2 until the day He was taken up, after He had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He had chosen.
44Ac 1:3 After He had suffered, He also presented Himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 1:4 While He was together with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's promise. "This," [He said, "is what] you heard from Me;
44Ac 1:5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
44Ac 1:6 So when they had come together, they asked Him, "Lord, at this time are You restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
44Ac 1:7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or periods that the Father has set by His own authority.
44Ac 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44Ac 1:9 After He had said this, He was taken up as they were watching, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
44Ac 1:10 While He was going, they were gazing into heaven, and suddenly two men in white clothes stood by them.
44Ac 1:11 They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you have seen Him going into heaven."
44Ac 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olive Grove, which is near Jerusalem-- a Sabbath day's journey away.
44Ac 1:13 When they arrived, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
44Ac 1:14 All these were continually united in prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.
44Ac 1:15 During these days Peter stood up among the brothers-- the number of people who were together was about 120-- and said:
44Ac 1:16 "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit through the mouth of David spoke in advance about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
44Ac 1:17 For he was one of our number and was allotted a share in this ministry."
44Ac 1:18 Now this man acquired a field with his unrighteous wages; and falling headfirst, he burst open in the middle, and all his insides spilled out.
44Ac 1:19 This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that in their own language that field is called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.
44Ac 1:20 "For it is written in the Book of Psalms: Let his dwelling become desolate; let no one live in it; and Let someone else take his position.
44Ac 1:21 "Therefore, from among the men who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--
44Ac 1:22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up from us-- from among these, it is necessary that one become a witness with us of His resurrection."
44Ac 1:23 So they proposed two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 Then they prayed, "You, Lord, know the hearts of all; show which of these two You have chosen
44Ac 1:25 to take the place in this apostolic service that Judas left to go to his own place."
44Ac 1:26 Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias. So he was numbered with the 11 apostles.
44Ac 2:1 When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place.
44Ac 2:2 Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying.
44Ac 2:3 And tongues, like flames of fire that were divided, appeared to them and rested on each one of them.
44Ac 2:4 Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different languages, as the Spirit gave them ability for speech.
44Ac 2:5 There were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.
44Ac 2:6 When this sound occurred, the multitude came together and was confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
44Ac 2:7 And they were astounded and amazed, saying, "Look, aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?
44Ac 2:8 How is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?
44Ac 2:9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
44Ac 2:11 Cretans and Arabs-- we hear them speaking in our own languages the magnificent acts of God."
44Ac 2:12 And they were all astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, "What could this be?"
44Ac 2:13 But some sneered and said, "They're full of new wine!"
44Ac 2:14 But Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them: "Jewish men and all you residents of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and pay attention to my words.
44Ac 2:15 For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it's only nine in the morning.
44Ac 2:16 On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
44Ac 2:17 And it will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.
44Ac 2:18 I will even pour out My Spirit on My male and female slaves in those days, and they will prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 I will display wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below: blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.
44Ac 2:20 The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and remarkable day of the Lord comes;
44Ac 2:21 then whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
44Ac 2:22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words: This Jesus the Nazarene was a man pointed out to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through Him, just as you yourselves know.
44Ac 2:23 Though He was delivered up according to God's determined plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail Him to a cross and kill Him.
44Ac 2:24 God raised Him up, ending the pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
44Ac 2:25 For David says of Him: I saw the Lord ever before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
44Ac 2:26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh will rest in hope,
44Ac 2:27 because You will not leave my soul in Hades, or allow Your Holy One to see decay.
44Ac 2:28 You have revealed the paths of life to me; You will fill me with gladness in Your presence.
44Ac 2:29 "Brothers, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
44Ac 2:30 Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants on his throne.
44Ac 2:31 Seeing this in advance, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah: He was not left in Hades, and His flesh did not experience decay.
44Ac 2:32 "God has resurrected this Jesus. We are all witnesses of this.
44Ac 2:33 Therefore, since He has been exalted to the right hand of God and has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, He has poured out what you both see and hear.
44Ac 2:34 For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says: The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand
44Ac 2:35 until I make Your enemies Your footstool.'
44Ac 2:36 "Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah!"
44Ac 2:37 When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: "Brothers, what must we do?"
44Ac 2:38 "Repent," Peter said to them, "and be baptized, each of you, in the name of Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 2:39 For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call."
44Ac 2:40 And with many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, "Be saved from this corrupt generation!"
44Ac 2:41 So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 people were added to them.
44Ac 2:42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayers.
44Ac 2:43 Then fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles.
44Ac 2:44 Now all the believers were together and had everything in common.
44Ac 2:45 So they sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as anyone had a need.
44Ac 2:46 And every day they devoted themselves [to meeting] together in the temple complex, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
44Ac 2:47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And every day the Lord added to them those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 Now Peter and John were going up together to the temple complex at the hour of prayer at three in the afternoon.
44Ac 3:2 And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was carried there and placed every day at the temple gate called Beautiful, so he could beg from those entering the temple complex.
44Ac 3:3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple complex, he asked for help.
44Ac 3:4 Peter, along with John, looked at him intently and said, "Look at us."
44Ac 3:5 So he turned to them, expecting to get something from them.
44Ac 3:6 But Peter said, "I have neither silver nor gold, but what I have, I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk!"
44Ac 3:7 Then, taking him by the right hand he raised him up, and at once his feet and ankles became strong.
44Ac 3:8 So he jumped up, stood, and started to walk, and he entered the temple complex with them-- walking, leaping, and praising God.
44Ac 3:9 All the people saw him walking and praising God,
44Ac 3:10 and they recognized that he was the one who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple complex. So they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him.
44Ac 3:11 While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people, greatly amazed, ran toward them in what is called Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 3:12 When Peter saw this, he addressed the people: "Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?
44Ac 3:13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
44Ac 3:14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked to have a murderer given to you.
44Ac 3:15 And you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead; we are witnesses of this.
44Ac 3:16 By faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. So the faith that comes through Him has given him this perfect health in front of all of you.
44Ac 3:17 "And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, just as your leaders also did.
44Ac 3:18 But what God predicted through the mouth of all the prophets-- that His Messiah would suffer-- He has fulfilled in this way.
44Ac 3:19 Therefore repent and turn back, that your sins may be wiped out so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
44Ac 3:20 and He may send Jesus, who has been appointed Messiah for you.
44Ac 3:21 Heaven must welcome Him until the times of the restoration of all things, which God spoke about by the mouth of His holy prophets from the beginning.
44Ac 3:22 Moses said: The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to Him in everything He will say to you.
44Ac 3:23 And it will be that everyone who will not listen to that Prophet will be completely cut off from the people.
44Ac 3:24 "In addition, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, have also announced these days.
44Ac 3:25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your forefathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed all the families of the earth will be blessed.
44Ac 3:26 God raised up His Servant and sent Him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your evil ways."
44Ac 4:1 Now as they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guard, and the Sadducees confronted them,
44Ac 4:2 because they were provoked that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the person of Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
44Ac 4:3 So they seized them and put them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.
44Ac 4:4 But many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of the men came to about 5,000.
44Ac 4:5 The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem
44Ac 4:6 with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John and Alexander, and all the members of the high-priestly family.
44Ac 4:7 After they had Peter and John stand before them, they asked the question: "By what power or in what name have you done this?"
44Ac 4:8 Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders:
44Ac 4:9 If we are being examined today about a good deed done to a disabled man-- by what means he was healed--
44Ac 4:10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene-- whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead-- by Him this man is standing here before you healthy.
44Ac 4:11 This [Jesus] is The stone despised by you builders, who has become the cornerstone.
44Ac 4:12 There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved."
44Ac 4:13 When they observed the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed and knew that they had been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 And since they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in response.
44Ac 4:15 After they had ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves,
44Ac 4:16 saying, "What should we do with these men? For an obvious sign, evident to all who live in Jerusalem, has been done through them, and we cannot deny it!
44Ac 4:17 But so this does not spread any further among the people, let's threaten them against speaking to anyone in this name again."
44Ac 4:18 So they called for them and ordered them not to preach or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it's right in the sight of God [for us] to listen to you rather than to God, you decide;
44Ac 4:20 for we are unable to stop speaking about what we have seen and heard."
44Ac 4:21 After threatening them further, they released them. They found no way to punish them, because the people were all giving glory to God over what had been done;
44Ac 4:22 for the man was over 40 years old on whom this sign of healing had been performed.
44Ac 4:23 After they were released, they went to their own fellowship and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
44Ac 4:24 When they heard this, they raised their voices to God unanimously and said, "Master, You are the One who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and everything in them.
44Ac 4:25 You said through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David Your servant: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot futile things?
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers assembled together against the Lord and against His Messiah.
44Ac 4:27 "For, in fact, in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed,
44Ac 4:28 to do whatever Your hand and Your plan had predestined to take place.
44Ac 4:29 And now, Lord, consider their threats, and grant that Your slaves may speak Your message with complete boldness,
44Ac 4:30 while You stretch out Your hand for healing, signs, and wonders to be performed through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus."
44Ac 4:31 When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak God's message with boldness.
44Ac 4:32 Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own, but instead they held everything in common.
44Ac 4:33 And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on all of them.
44Ac 4:34 For there was not a needy person among them, because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
44Ac 4:35 and laid them at the apostles' feet. This was then distributed to each person as anyone had a need.
44Ac 4:36 Joseph, a Levite and a Cypriot by birth, whom the apostles named Barnabas, which is translated Son of Encouragement,
44Ac 4:37 sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:1 But a man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property.
44Ac 5:2 However, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife's knowledge, and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:3 Then Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds from the field?
44Ac 5:4 Wasn't it yours while you possessed it? And after it was sold, wasn't it at your disposal? Why is it that you planned this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God!"
44Ac 5:5 When he heard these words, Ananias dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard.
44Ac 5:6 The young men got up, wrapped [his body], carried him out, and buried him.
44Ac 5:7 There was an interval of about three hours; then his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 "Tell me," Peter asked her, "did you sell the field for this price?" "Yes," she said, "for that price."
44Ac 5:9 Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!"
44Ac 5:10 Instantly she dropped dead at his feet. When the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband.
44Ac 5:11 Then great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard these things.
44Ac 5:12 Many signs and wonders were being done among the people through the hands of the apostles. By common consent they would all meet in Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 5:13 None of the rest dared to join them, but the people praised them highly.
44Ac 5:14 Believers were added to the Lord in increasing numbers-- crowds of both men and women.
44Ac 5:15 As a result, they would carry the sick out into the streets and lay them on beds and pallets so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
44Ac 5:16 In addition, a multitude came together from the towns surrounding Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
44Ac 5:17 Then the high priest took action. He and all his colleagues, those who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
44Ac 5:18 So they arrested the apostles and put them in the city jail.
44Ac 5:19 But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail during the night, brought them out, and said,
44Ac 5:20 "Go and stand in the temple complex, and tell the people all about this life."
44Ac 5:21 In obedience to this, they entered the temple complex at daybreak and began to teach. When the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin-- the full Senate of the sons of Israel-- and sent [orders] to the jail to have them brought.
44Ac 5:22 But when the temple police got there, they did not find them in the jail, so they returned and reported,
44Ac 5:23 "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing in front of the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"
44Ac 5:24 As the captain of the temple police and the chief priests heard these things, they were baffled about them, as to what could come of this.
44Ac 5:25 Someone came and reported to them, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple complex and teaching the people."
44Ac 5:26 Then the captain went with the temple police and brought them in without force, because they were afraid the people might stone them.
44Ac 5:27 When they had brought them in, they had them stand before the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked,
44Ac 5:28 "Didn't we strictly order you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!"
44Ac 5:29 But Peter and the apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than men.
44Ac 5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had murdered by hanging Him on a tree.
44Ac 5:31 God exalted this man to His right hand as ruler and Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
44Ac 5:32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him."
44Ac 5:33 When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
44Ac 5:34 A Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.
44Ac 5:35 He said to them, "Men of Israel, be careful about what you're going to do to these men.
44Ac 5:36 Not long ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about 400 men rallied to him. He was killed, and all his partisans were dispersed and came to nothing.
44Ac 5:37 After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and attracted a following. That man also perished, and all his partisans were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 And now, I tell you, stay away from these men and leave them alone. For if this plan or this work is of men, it will be overthrown;
44Ac 5:39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even be found fighting against God." So they were persuaded by him.
44Ac 5:40 After they called in the apostles and had them flogged, they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them.
44Ac 5:41 Then they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name.
44Ac 5:42 Every day in the temple complex, and in various homes, they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that the Messiah is Jesus.
44Ac 6:1 In those days, as the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint by the Hellenistic Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.
44Ac 6:2 Then the Twelve summoned the whole company of the disciples and said, "It would not be right for us to give up preaching about God to wait on tables.
44Ac 6:3 Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we can appoint to this duty.
44Ac 6:4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the preaching ministry."
44Ac 6:5 The proposal pleased the whole company. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.
44Ac 6:6 They had them stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44Ac 6:7 So the preaching about God flourished, the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly, and a large group of priests became obedient to the faith.
44Ac 6:8 Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 Then some from what is called the Freedmen's Synagogue, composed of both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, came forward and disputed with Stephen.
44Ac 6:10 But they were unable to stand up against the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke.
44Ac 6:11 Then they induced men to say, "We heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God!"
44Ac 6:12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; so they came up, dragged him off, and took him to the Sanhedrin.
44Ac 6:13 They also presented false witnesses who said, "This man does not stop speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
44Ac 6:14 For we heard him say that Jesus, this Nazarene, will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
44Ac 6:15 And all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44Ac 7:1 "Is this true?" the high priest asked.
44Ac 7:2 "Brothers and fathers," he said, "listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,
44Ac 7:3 and said to him: Get out of your country and away from your relatives, and come to the land that I will show you.
44Ac 7:4 "Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God had him move to this land in which you now live.
44Ac 7:5 He didn't give him an inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, but He promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though he was childless.
44Ac 7:6 God spoke in this way: His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and they would enslave and oppress them for 400 years.
44Ac 7:7 I will judge the nation that they will serve as slaves, God said. After this, they will come out and worship Me in this place.
44Ac 7:8 Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision. This being so, he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; Isaac did the same with Jacob, and Jacob with the 12 patriarchs.
44Ac 7:9 "The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt, but God was with him
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him out of all his troubles. He gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him governor over Egypt and over his whole household.
44Ac 7:11 Then a famine came over all of Egypt and Canaan, with great suffering, and our forefathers could find no food.
44Ac 7:12 When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers the first time.
44Ac 7:13 The second time, Joseph was revealed to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.
44Ac 7:14 Joseph then invited his father Jacob and all his relatives, 75 people in all,
44Ac 7:15 and Jacob went down to Egypt. He and our forefathers died there,
44Ac 7:16 were carried back to Shechem, and were placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
44Ac 7:17 "As the time was drawing near to fulfill the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people flourished and multiplied in Egypt
44Ac 7:18 until a different king ruled over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
44Ac 7:19 He dealt deceitfully with our race and oppressed our forefathers by making them leave their infants outside so they wouldn't survive.
44Ac 7:20 At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful before God. He was nursed in his father's home three months,
44Ac 7:21 and when he was left outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted and raised him as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in his speech and actions.
44Ac 7:23 "As he was approaching the age of 40, he decided to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.
44Ac 7:24 When he saw one of them being mistreated, he came to his rescue and avenged the oppressed man by striking down the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 He assumed his brothers would understand that God would give them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.
44Ac 7:26 The next day he showed up while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them peacefully, saying, 'Men, you are brothers. Why are you mistreating each other?'
44Ac 7:27 "But the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed him away, saying: Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?
44Ac 7:28 Do you want to kill me, the same way you killed the Egyptian yesterday?
44Ac 7:29 "At this disclosure, Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.
44Ac 7:30 After 40 years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.
44Ac 7:31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he was approaching to look at it, the voice of the Lord came:
44Ac 7:32 I am the God of your forefathers-- the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. So Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look.
44Ac 7:33 "Then the Lord said to him: Take the sandals off your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44Ac 7:34 I have certainly seen the oppression of My people in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to rescue them. And now, come, I will send you to Egypt.
44Ac 7:35 "This Moses, whom they rejected when they said, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge?-- this one God sent as a ruler and a redeemer by means of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44Ac 7:36 This man led them out and performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the desert for 40 years.
44Ac 7:37 "This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your brothers.
44Ac 7:38 He is the one who was in the congregation in the desert together with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our forefathers. He received living oracles to give to us.
44Ac 7:39 Our forefathers were unwilling to obey him, but pushed him away, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
44Ac 7:40 They told Aaron: Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what's become of him.
44Ac 7:41 They even made a calf in those days, offered sacrifice to the idol, and were celebrating what their hands had made.
44Ac 7:42 Then God turned away and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did you bring Me offerings and sacrifices for 40 years in the desert, O house of Israel?
44Ac 7:43 No, you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship. So I will deport you beyond Babylon!
44Ac 7:44 "Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the desert, just as He who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
44Ac 7:45 Our forefathers in turn received it and with Joshua brought it in when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers, until the days of David.
44Ac 7:46 He found favor in God's sight and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44Ac 7:47 But it was Solomon who built Him a house.
44Ac 7:48 However, the Most High does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands, as the prophet says:
44Ac 7:49 Heaven is My throne, and earth My footstool. What sort of house will you build for Me? says the Lord, or what is My resting place?
44Ac 7:50 Did not My hand make all these things?
44Ac 7:51 "You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always resisting the Holy Spirit; as your forefathers did, so do you.
44Ac 7:52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They even killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become.
44Ac 7:53 You received the law under the direction of angels and yet have not kept it."
44Ac 7:54 When they heard these things, they were enraged in their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him.
44Ac 7:55 But Stephen, filled by the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven. He saw God's glory, with Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and he said,
44Ac 7:56 "Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"
44Ac 7:57 Then they screamed at the top of their voices, stopped their ears, and rushed together against him.
44Ac 7:58 They threw him out of the city and began to stone him. And the witnesses laid their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44Ac 7:59 They were stoning Stephen as he called out: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
44Ac 7:60 Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not charge them with this sin!" And saying this, he fell asleep.
44Ac 8:1 Saul agreed with putting him to death. On that day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the land of Judea and Samaria.
44Ac 8:2 But devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him.
44Ac 8:3 Saul, however, was ravaging the church, and he would enter house after house, drag off men and women, and put them in prison.
44Ac 8:4 So those who were scattered went on their way proclaiming the message of good news.
44Ac 8:5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and preached the Messiah to them.
44Ac 8:6 The crowds paid attention with one mind to what Philip said, as they heard and saw the signs he was performing.
44Ac 8:7 For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
44Ac 8:8 So there was great joy in that city.
44Ac 8:9 A man named Simon had previously practiced sorcery in that city and astounded the Samaritan people, while claiming to be somebody great.
44Ac 8:10 They all paid attention to him, from the least of them to the greatest, and they said, "This man is called the Great Power of God!"
44Ac 8:11 They were attentive to him because he had astounded them with his sorceries for a long time.
44Ac 8:12 But when they believed Philip, as he proclaimed the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
44Ac 8:13 Then even Simon himself believed. And after he was baptized, he went around constantly with Philip and was astounded as he observed the signs and great miracles that were being performed.
44Ac 8:14 When the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had welcomed God's message, they sent Peter and John to them.
44Ac 8:15 After they went down there, they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:16 For He had not yet come down on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:18 When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
44Ac 8:19 saying, "Give me this power too, so that anyone I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 8:20 But Peter told him, "May your silver be destroyed with you, because you thought the gift of God could be obtained with money!
44Ac 8:21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.
44Ac 8:22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
44Ac 8:23 For I see you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity."
44Ac 8:24 "Please pray to the Lord for me," Simon replied, "so that nothing you have said may happen to me."
44Ac 8:25 Then, after they had testified and spoken the message of the Lord, they traveled back to Jerusalem, evangelizing many villages of the Samaritans.
44Ac 8:26 An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip: "Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to desert Gaza."
44Ac 8:27 So he got up and went. There was an Ethiopian man, a eunuch and high official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to worship in Jerusalem
44Ac 8:28 and was sitting in his chariot on his way home, reading the prophet Isaiah aloud.
44Ac 8:29 The Spirit told Philip, "Go and join that chariot."
44Ac 8:30 When Philip ran up to it, he heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do you understand what you're reading?"
44Ac 8:31 "How can I," he said, "unless someone guides me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 Now the Scripture passage he was reading was this: He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb is silent before its shearer, so He does not open His mouth.
44Ac 8:33 In His humiliation justice was denied Him. Who will describe His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.
44Ac 8:34 The eunuch replied to Philip, "I ask you, who is the prophet saying this about-- himself or another person?"
44Ac 8:35 So Philip proceeded to tell him the good news about Jesus, beginning from that Scripture.
44Ac 8:36 As they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, "Look, there's water! What would keep me from being baptized?"
44Ac 8:37 [[And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart you may." And he replied, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."]]
44Ac 8:38 Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer. But he went on his way rejoicing.
44Ac 8:40 Philip appeared in Azotus, and passing through, he was evangelizing all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 Meanwhile Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
44Ac 9:2 and requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, either men or women, he might bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:3 As he traveled and was nearing Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.
44Ac 9:4 Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
44Ac 9:5 "Who are You, Lord?" he said. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," He replied.
44Ac 9:6 "But get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44Ac 9:7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the sound but seeing no one.
44Ac 9:8 Then Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 He was unable to see for three days, and did not eat or drink.
44Ac 9:10 Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Here I am, Lord!" he said.
44Ac 9:11 "Get up and go to the street called Straight," the Lord said to him, "to the house of Judas, and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, since he is praying there.
44Ac 9:12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him so he may regain his sight."
44Ac 9:13 "Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:14 And he has authority here from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name."
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go! For this man is My chosen instrument to carry My name before Gentiles, kings, and the sons of Israel.
44Ac 9:16 I will certainly show him how much he must suffer for My name!"
44Ac 9:17 So Ananias left and entered the house. Then he placed his hands on him and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road you were traveling, has sent me so you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 At once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized.
44Ac 9:19 And after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.
44Ac 9:20 Immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: "He is the Son of God."
44Ac 9:21 But all who heard him were astounded and said, "Isn't this the man who, in Jerusalem, was destroying those who called on this name, and then came here for the purpose of taking them as prisoners to the chief priests?"
44Ac 9:22 But Saul grew more capable, and kept confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this One is the Messiah.
44Ac 9:23 After many days had passed, the Jews conspired to kill him,
44Ac 9:24 but their plot became known to Saul. So they were watching the gates day and night intending to kill him,
44Ac 9:25 but his disciples took him by night and lowered him in a large basket through [an opening in] the wall.
44Ac 9:26 When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, since they did not believe he was a disciple.
44Ac 9:27 Barnabas, however, took him and brought him to the apostles and explained to them how, on the road, Saul had seen the Lord, and that He had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 9:28 Saul was coming and going with them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 He conversed and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they attempted to kill him.
44Ac 9:30 When the brothers found out, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44Ac 9:31 So the church throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace, being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, and it increased in numbers.
44Ac 9:32 As Peter was traveling from place to place, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.
44Ac 9:34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your own bed," and immediately he got up.
44Ac 9:35 So all who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44Ac 9:36 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. She was always doing good works and acts of charity.
44Ac 9:37 In those days she became sick and died. After washing her, they placed her in a room upstairs.
44Ac 9:38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him who begged him, "Don't delay in coming with us."
44Ac 9:39 So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they led him to the room upstairs. And all the widows approached him, weeping and showing him the robes and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was with them.
44Ac 9:40 Then Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down, prayed, and turning toward the body said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up.
44Ac 9:41 He gave her his hand and helped her stand up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive.
44Ac 9:42 This became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 And Peter stayed on many days in Joppa with Simon, a leather tanner.
44Ac 10:1 There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment.
44Ac 10:2 He was a devout man and feared God along with his whole household. He did many charitable deeds for the [Jewish] people and always prayed to God.
44Ac 10:3 At about three in the afternoon he distinctly saw in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him, "Cornelius!"
44Ac 10:4 Looking intently at him, he became afraid and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he told him, "Your prayers and your acts of charity have come up as a memorial offering before God.
44Ac 10:5 Now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, who is also named Peter.
44Ac 10:6 He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea."
44Ac 10:7 When the angel who spoke to him had gone, he called two of his household slaves and a devout soldier, who was one of those who attended him.
44Ac 10:8 After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
44Ac 10:9 The next day, as they were traveling and nearing the city, Peter went up to pray on the housetop at about noon.
44Ac 10:10 Then he became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing something he went into a visionary state.
44Ac 10:11 He saw heaven opened and an object coming down that resembled a large sheet being lowered to the earth by its four corners.
44Ac 10:12 In it were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth, and the birds of the sky.
44Ac 10:13 Then a voice said to him, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!"
44Ac 10:14 "No, Lord!" Peter said. "For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!"
44Ac 10:15 Again, a second time, a voice said to him, "What God has made clean, you must not call common."
44Ac 10:16 This happened three times, and then the object was taken up into heaven.
44Ac 10:17 While Peter was deeply perplexed about what the vision he had seen might mean, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions to Simon's house, stood at the gate.
44Ac 10:18 They called out, asking if Simon, who was also named Peter, was lodging there.
44Ac 10:19 While Peter was thinking about the vision, the Spirit told him, "Three men are here looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 Get up, go downstairs, and accompany them with no doubts at all, because I have sent them."
44Ac 10:21 Then Peter went down to the men and said, "Here I am, the one you're looking for. What is the reason you're here?"
44Ac 10:22 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who has a good reputation with the whole Jewish nation, was divinely directed by a holy angel to call you to his house and to hear a message from you."
44Ac 10:23 Peter then invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him.
44Ac 10:24 The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44Ac 10:25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
44Ac 10:26 But Peter helped him up and said, "Stand up! I myself am also a man."
44Ac 10:27 While talking with him, he went on in and found that many had come together there.
44Ac 10:28 Peter said to them, "You know it's forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner. But God has shown me that I must not call any person common or unclean.
44Ac 10:29 That's why I came without any objection when I was sent for. So I ask, 'Why did you send for me?'"
44Ac 10:30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago at this hour, at three in the afternoon, I was praying in my house. Just then a man in a dazzling robe stood before me
44Ac 10:31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered in God's sight.
44Ac 10:32 Therefore send someone to Joppa and invite Simon here, who is also named Peter. He is lodging in Simon the tanner's house by the sea.'
44Ac 10:33 Therefore I immediately sent for you, and you did the right thing in coming. So we are all present before God, to hear everything you have been commanded by the Lord."
44Ac 10:34 Then Peter began to speak: "In truth, I understand that God doesn't show favoritism,
44Ac 10:35 but in every nation the person who fears Him and does righteousness is acceptable to Him.
44Ac 10:36 He sent the message to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ-- He is Lord of all.
44Ac 10:37 You know the events that took place throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John preached:
44Ac 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and curing all who were under the tyranny of the Devil, because God was with Him.
44Ac 10:39 We ourselves are witnesses of everything He did in both the Judean country and in Jerusalem; yet they killed Him by hanging Him on a tree.
44Ac 10:40 God raised up this man on the third day and permitted Him to be seen,
44Ac 10:41 not by all the people, but by us, witnesses appointed beforehand by God, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
44Ac 10:42 He commanded us to preach to the people, and to solemnly testify that He is the One appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 All the prophets testify about Him that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins."
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came down on all those who heard the message.
44Ac 10:45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.
44Ac 10:46 For they heard them speaking in [other] languages and declaring the greatness of God. Then Peter responded,
44Ac 10:47 "Can anyone withhold water and prevent these from being baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
44Ac 10:48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days.
44Ac 11:1 The apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles had welcomed God's message also.
44Ac 11:2 When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who stressed circumcision argued with him,
44Ac 11:3 saying, "You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them!"
44Ac 11:4 Peter began to explain to them in an orderly sequence, saying:
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the town of Joppa praying, and I saw, in a visionary state, an object coming down that resembled a large sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me.
44Ac 11:6 When I looked closely and considered it, I saw the four-footed animals of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky.
44Ac 11:7 Then I also heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat!'
44Ac 11:8 " 'No, Lord!' I said. 'For nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!'
44Ac 11:9 But a voice answered from heaven a second time, 'What God has made clean, you must not call common.'
44Ac 11:10 "Now this happened three times, and then everything was drawn up again into heaven.
44Ac 11:11 At that very moment, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were.
44Ac 11:12 Then the Spirit told me to go with them with no doubts at all. These six brothers accompanied me, and we went into the man's house.
44Ac 11:13 He reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, 'Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is also named Peter.
44Ac 11:14 He will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.'
44Ac 11:15 "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came down on them, just as on us at the beginning.
44Ac 11:16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44Ac 11:17 Therefore, if God gave them the same gift that He also gave to us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, how could I possibly hinder God?"
44Ac 11:18 When they heard this they became silent. Then they glorified God, saying, "So God has granted repentance resulting in life to even the Gentiles!"
44Ac 11:19 Those who had been scattered as a result of the persecution that started because of Stephen made their way as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message to no one except Jews.
44Ac 11:20 But there were some of them, Cypriot and Cyrenian men, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Hellenists, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 11:21 The Lord's hand was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
44Ac 11:22 Then the report about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to travel as far as Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he encouraged all of them to remain true to the Lord with a firm resolve of the heart--
44Ac 11:24 for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith-- and large numbers of people were added to the Lord.
44Ac 11:25 Then he went to Tarsus to search for Saul,
44Ac 11:26 and when he found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught large numbers, and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
44Ac 11:27 In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine throughout the Roman world. This took place during the time of Claudius.
44Ac 11:29 So each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea.
44Ac 11:30 This they did, sending it to the elders by means of Barnabas and Saul.
44Ac 12:1 About that time King Herod cruelly attacked some who belonged to the church,
44Ac 12:2 and he killed James, John's brother, with the sword.
44Ac 12:3 When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter too, during the days of Unleavened Bread.
44Ac 12:4 After the arrest, he put him in prison and assigned four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in prison, but prayer was being made earnestly to God for him by the church.
44Ac 12:6 On the night before Herod was to bring him out [for execution], Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while the sentries in front of the door guarded the prison.
44Ac 12:7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. Striking Peter on the side, he woke him up and said, "Quick, get up!" Then the chains fell off his wrists.
44Ac 12:8 "Get dressed," the angel told him, "and put on your sandals." And he did so. "Wrap your cloak around you," he told him, "and follow me."
44Ac 12:9 So he went out and followed, and he did not know that what took place through the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
44Ac 12:10 After they passed the first and second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went outside and passed one street, and immediately the angel left him.
44Ac 12:11 Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod's grasp and from all that the Jewish people expected."
44Ac 12:12 When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many had assembled and were praying.
44Ac 12:13 He knocked at the door in the gateway, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer.
44Ac 12:14 She recognized Peter's voice, and because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gateway.
44Ac 12:15 "You're crazy!" they told her. But she kept insisting that it was true. Then they said, "It's his angel!"
44Ac 12:16 Peter, however, kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded.
44Ac 12:17 Motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he explained to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. "Report these things to James and the brothers," he said. Then he departed and went to a different place.
44Ac 12:18 At daylight, there was a great commotion among the soldiers as to what could have become of Peter.
44Ac 12:19 After Herod had searched and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered their execution. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
44Ac 12:20 He had been very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians. Together they presented themselves before him, and having won over Blastus, who was in charge of the king's bedroom, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food from the king's country.
44Ac 12:21 So on an appointed day, dressed in royal robes and seated on the throne, Herod delivered a public address to them.
44Ac 12:22 The populace began to shout, "It's the voice of a god and not of a man!"
44Ac 12:23 At once an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God, and he became infected with worms and died.
44Ac 12:24 Then God's message flourished and multiplied.
44Ac 12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after they had completed their relief mission, on which they took John Mark.
44Ac 13:1 In the local church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen, a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
44Ac 13:2 As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work that I have called them to."
44Ac 13:3 Then, after they had fasted, prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them off.
44Ac 13:4 Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they came down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed God's message in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their assistant.
44Ac 13:6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
44Ac 13:7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas, the sorcerer, which is how his name is translated, opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44Ac 13:9 Then Saul-- also called Paul-- filled with the Holy Spirit, stared straight at the sorcerer
44Ac 13:10 and said, "You son of the Devil, full of all deceit and all fraud, enemy of all righteousness! Won't you ever stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?
44Ac 13:11 Now, look! The Lord's hand is against you: you are going to be blind, and will not see the sun for a time." Suddenly a mist and darkness fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44Ac 13:12 Then the proconsul, seeing what happened, believed and was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
44Ac 13:13 Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and went back to Jerusalem.
44Ac 13:14 They continued their journey from Perga and reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
44Ac 13:15 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent [word] to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you can speak."
44Ac 13:16 Then standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and spoke: "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen!
44Ac 13:17 The God of this people Israel chose our forefathers, exalted the people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and led them out of it with a mighty arm.
44Ac 13:18 And for about 40 years He put up with them in the desert;
44Ac 13:19 then after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land to them as an inheritance.
44Ac 13:20 This all took about 450 years. After this, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
44Ac 13:21 Then they asked for a king, so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years.
44Ac 13:22 After removing him, He raised up David as their king, of whom He testified: ' I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will carry out all My will.'
44Ac 13:23 "From this man's descendants, according to the promise, God brought the Savior, Jesus, to Israel.
44Ac 13:24 Before He came to public attention, John had previously proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
44Ac 13:25 Then as John was completing his life work, he said, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the One. But look! Someone is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on His feet.'
44Ac 13:26 "Brothers, sons of Abraham's race, and those among you who fear God, the message of this salvation has been sent to us.
44Ac 13:27 For the residents of Jerusalem and their rulers, since they did not recognize Him or the voices of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled their words by condemning Him.
44Ac 13:28 Though they found no grounds for the death penalty, they asked Pilate to have Him killed.
44Ac 13:29 When they had fulfilled all that had been written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and put Him in a tomb.
44Ac 13:30 But God raised Him from the dead,
44Ac 13:31 and He appeared for many days to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.
44Ac 13:32 And we ourselves proclaim to you the good news of the promise that was made to our forefathers.
44Ac 13:33 God has fulfilled this to us their children by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm: You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.
44Ac 13:34 Since He raised Him from the dead, never to return to decay, He has spoken in this way, I will grant you the faithful covenant blessings made to David.
44Ac 13:35 Therefore He also says in another passage, You will not allow Your Holy One to see decay.
44Ac 13:36 For David, after serving his own generation in God's plan, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and decayed.
44Ac 13:37 But the One whom God raised up did not decay.
44Ac 13:38 Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you,
44Ac 13:39 and everyone who believes in Him is justified from everything, which you could not be justified from through the law of Moses.
44Ac 13:40 So beware that what is said in the prophets does not happen to you:
44Ac 13:41 Look, you scoffers, marvel and vanish away, because I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never believe, even if someone were to explain it to you."
44Ac 13:42 As they were leaving, they begged that these matters be presented to them the following Sabbath.
44Ac 13:43 After the synagogue had been dismissed, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and persuading them to continue in the grace of God.
44Ac 13:44 The following Sabbath almost the whole town assembled to hear the message of the Lord.
44Ac 13:45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to oppose what Paul was saying by insulting him.
44Ac 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said: "It was necessary that God's message be spoken to you first. But since you reject it, and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles!
44Ac 13:47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us: I have appointed you as a light for the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the ends of the earth."
44Ac 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who had been appointed to eternal life believed.
44Ac 13:49 So the message of the Lord spread through the whole region.
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews incited the religious women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their district.
44Ac 13:51 But shaking the dust off their feet against them, they proceeded to Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 14:1 The same thing happened in Iconium; they entered the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
44Ac 14:2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.
44Ac 14:3 So they stayed there for some time and spoke boldly, in reliance on the Lord, who testified to the message of His grace by granting that signs and wonders be performed through them.
44Ac 14:4 But the people of the city were divided, some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles.
44Ac 14:5 When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to assault and stone them,
44Ac 14:6 they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns called Lystra and Derbe, and to the surrounding countryside.
44Ac 14:7 And there they kept evangelizing.
44Ac 14:8 In Lystra a man without strength in his feet, lame from birth, and who had never walked, sat
44Ac 14:9 and heard Paul speaking. After observing him closely and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
44Ac 14:10 [Paul] said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet!" And he jumped up and started to walk around.
44Ac 14:11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in the form of men!"
44Ac 14:12 And they started to call Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the main speaker.
44Ac 14:13 Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the town, brought oxen and garlands to the gates. He, with the crowds, intended to offer sacrifice.
44Ac 14:14 The apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their robes when they heard this and rushed into the crowd, shouting:
44Ac 14:15 "Men! Why are you doing these things? We are men also, with the same nature as you, and we are proclaiming good news to you, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.
44Ac 14:16 In past generations He allowed all the nations to go their own way,
44Ac 14:17 although He did not leave Himself without a witness, since He did good: giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and satisfying your hearts with food and happiness."
44Ac 14:18 Even though they said these things, they barely stopped the crowds from sacrificing to them.
44Ac 14:19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and when they had won over the crowds and stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
44Ac 14:20 After the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the town. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
44Ac 14:21 After they had evangelized that town and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,
44Ac 14:22 strengthening the hearts of the disciples by encouraging them to continue in the faith, and by telling them, "It is necessary to pass through many troubles on our way into the kingdom of God."
44Ac 14:23 When they had appointed elders in every church and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
44Ac 14:24 Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
44Ac 14:25 After they spoke the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44Ac 14:26 From there they sailed back to Antioch where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had completed.
44Ac 14:27 After they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported everything God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
44Ac 14:28 And they spent a considerable time with the disciples.
44Ac 15:1 Some men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers: "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom prescribed by Moses, you cannot be saved!"
44Ac 15:2 But after Paul and Barnabas had engaged them in serious argument and debate, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this controversy.
44Ac 15:3 When they had been sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, explaining in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and they created great joy among all the brothers.
44Ac 15:4 When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
44Ac 15:5 But some of the believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses!"
44Ac 15:6 Then the apostles and the elders assembled to consider this matter.
44Ac 15:7 After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them: "Brothers, you are aware that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the gospel message and believe.
44Ac 15:8 And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us.
44Ac 15:9 He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
44Ac 15:10 Why, then, are you now testing God by putting on the disciples' necks a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?
44Ac 15:11 On the contrary, we believe we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way they are."
44Ac 15:12 Then the whole assembly fell silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
44Ac 15:13 After they stopped speaking, James responded: "Brothers, listen to me!
44Ac 15:14 Simeon has reported how God first intervened to take from the Gentiles a people for His name.
44Ac 15:15 And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
44Ac 15:16 After these things I will return and will rebuild David's tent, which has fallen down. I will rebuild its ruins and will set it up again,
44Ac 15:17 so that those who are left of mankind may seek the Lord-- even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the Lord who does these things,
44Ac 15:18 which have been known from long ago.
44Ac 15:19 Therefore, in my judgment, we should not cause difficulties for those who turn to God from among the Gentiles,
44Ac 15:20 but instead we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from eating anything that has been strangled, and from blood.
44Ac 15:21 For since ancient times, Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, and he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath day."
44Ac 15:22 Then the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, decided to select men from among them and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, both leading men among the brothers.
44Ac 15:23 They wrote this letter to be delivered by them: From the apostles and the elders, your brothers, To the brothers from among the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.
44Ac 15:24 Because we have heard that some to whom we gave no authorization went out from us and troubled you with their words and unsettled your hearts,
44Ac 15:25 we have unanimously decided to select men and send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
44Ac 15:26 who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 15:27 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will personally report the same things by word of mouth.
44Ac 15:28 For it was the Holy Spirit's decision-- and ours-- to put no greater burden on you than these necessary things:
44Ac 15:29 that you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.
44Ac 15:30 Then, being sent off, they went down to Antioch, and after gathering the assembly, they delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 When they read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
44Ac 15:32 Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers and strengthened them with a long message.
44Ac 15:33 After spending some time there, they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.
44Ac 15:34 (none)
44Ac 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas, along with many others, remained in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the message of the Lord.
44Ac 15:36 After some time had passed, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit the brothers in every town where we have preached the message of the Lord, and see how they're doing."
44Ac 15:37 Barnabas wanted to take along John Mark.
44Ac 15:38 But Paul did not think it appropriate to take along this man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.
44Ac 15:39 There was such a sharp disagreement that they parted company, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed off to Cyprus.
44Ac 15:40 Then Paul chose Silas and departed, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.
44Ac 15:41 He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44Ac 16:1 Then he went on to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman, but his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:2 The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke highly of him.
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted Timothy to go with him, so he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, since they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 As they traveled through the towns, they delivered to them the decisions reached by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and were increased in number daily.
44Ac 16:6 They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia and were prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in the province of Asia.
44Ac 16:7 When they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
44Ac 16:8 So, bypassing Mysia, they came down to Troas.
44Ac 16:9 During the night a vision appeared to Paul: a Macedonian man was standing and pleading with him, "Cross over to Macedonia and help us!"
44Ac 16:10 After he had seen the vision, we immediately made efforts to set out for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to evangelize them.
44Ac 16:11 Then, setting sail from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,
44Ac 16:12 and from there to Philippi, a Roman colony, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia. We stayed in that city for a number of days.
44Ac 16:13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate by the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women gathered there.
44Ac 16:14 A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was spoken by Paul.
44Ac 16:15 After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, "If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.
44Ac 16:16 Once, as we were on our way to prayer, a slave girl met us who had a spirit of prediction and made a large profit for her owners by fortune-telling.
44Ac 16:17 As she followed Paul and us she cried out, "These men are the slaves of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
44Ac 16:18 And she did this for many days. But Paul was greatly aggravated, and turning to the spirit, said, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out right away.
44Ac 16:19 When her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities.
44Ac 16:20 And bringing them before the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are seriously disturbing our city. They are Jews,
44Ac 16:21 and are promoting customs that are not legal for us as Romans to adopt or practice."
44Ac 16:22 Then the mob joined in the attack against them, and the chief magistrates stripped off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
44Ac 16:23 After they had inflicted many blows on them, they threw them in jail, ordering the jailer to keep them securely guarded.
44Ac 16:24 Receiving such an order, he put them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.
44Ac 16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
44Ac 16:26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the jail were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains came loose.
44Ac 16:27 When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison open, he drew his sword and was going to kill himself, since he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul called out in a loud voice, "Don't harm yourself, because all of us are here!"
44Ac 16:29 Then the jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
44Ac 16:30 Then he escorted them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 So they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved-- you and your household."
44Ac 16:32 Then they spoke the message of the Lord to him along with everyone in his house.
44Ac 16:33 He took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds. Right away he and all his family were baptized.
44Ac 16:34 He brought them up into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had believed God with his entire household.
44Ac 16:35 When daylight came, the chief magistrates sent the police to say, "Release those men!"
44Ac 16:36 The jailer reported these words to Paul: "The magistrates have sent orders for you to be released. So come out now and go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul said to them, "They beat us in public without a trial, although we are Roman citizens, and threw us in jail. And now are they going to smuggle us out secretly? Certainly not! On the contrary, let them come themselves and escort us out!"
44Ac 16:38 Then the police reported these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
44Ac 16:39 So they came and apologized to them, and escorting them out, they urged them to leave town.
44Ac 16:40 After leaving the jail, they came to Lydia's house where they saw and encouraged the brothers, and departed.
44Ac 17:1 Then they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:2 As usual, Paul went to them, and on three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
44Ac 17:3 explaining and showing that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying: "This is the Messiah, Jesus, whom I am proclaiming to you."
44Ac 17:4 Then some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, including a great number of God-fearing Greeks, as well as a number of the leading women.
44Ac 17:5 But the Jews became jealous, and when they had brought together some scoundrels from the marketplace and formed a mob, they set the city in an uproar. Attacking Jason's house, they searched for them to bring them out to the public assembly.
44Ac 17:6 When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here too,
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has received them as guests! They are all acting contrary to Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king-- Jesus!"
44Ac 17:8 The Jews stirred up the crowd and the city officials who heard these things.
44Ac 17:9 So taking a security bond from Jason and the others, they released them.
44Ac 17:10 As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea. On arrival, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
44Ac 17:11 The people here were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, since they welcomed the message with eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
44Ac 17:12 Consequently, many of them believed, including a number of the prominent Greek women as well as men.
44Ac 17:13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
44Ac 17:14 Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to go to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed on there.
44Ac 17:15 Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.
44Ac 17:16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was troubled within him when he saw that the city was full of idols.
44Ac 17:17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who worshiped God, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
44Ac 17:18 Then also, some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers argued with him. Some said, "What is this pseudo-intellectual trying to say?" Others replied, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign deities"-- because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44Ac 17:19 They took him and brought him to the Areopagus, and said, "May we learn about this new teaching you're speaking of?
44Ac 17:20 For what you say sounds strange to us, and we want to know what these ideas mean."
44Ac 17:21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time on nothing else but telling or hearing something new.
44Ac 17:22 Then Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that you are extremely religious in every respect.
44Ac 17:23 For as I was passing through and observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
44Ac 17:24 The God who made the world and everything in it-- He is Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in shrines made by hands.
44Ac 17:25 Neither is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives everyone life and breath and all things.
44Ac 17:26 From one man He has made every nation of men to live all over the earth and has determined their appointed times and the boundaries of where they live,
44Ac 17:27 so that they might seek God, and perhaps they might reach out and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
44Ac 17:28 For in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also His offspring.'
44Ac 17:29 Being God's offspring, then, we shouldn't think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image fashioned by human art and imagination.
44Ac 17:30 "Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent,
44Ac 17:31 because He has set a day on which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by the Man He has appointed. He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead."
44Ac 17:32 When they heard about resurrection of the dead, some began to ridicule him. But others said, "We will hear you about this again."
44Ac 17:33 So Paul went out from their presence.
44Ac 17:34 However, some men joined him and believed, among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
44Ac 18:1 After this, he left from Athens and went to Corinth,
44Ac 18:2 where he found a Jewish man named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul came to them,
44Ac 18:3 and being of the same occupation, stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
44Ac 18:4 He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 18:5 When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with preaching the message and solemnly testified to the Jews that the Messiah is Jesus.
44Ac 18:6 But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his clothes and told them, "Your blood is on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
44Ac 18:7 So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
44Ac 18:8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed the Lord, along with his whole household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.
44Ac 18:9 Then the Lord said to Paul in a night vision, "Don't be afraid, but keep on speaking and don't be silent.
44Ac 18:10 For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you to hurt you, because I have many people in this city."
44Ac 18:11 And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
44Ac 18:12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack against Paul and brought him to the judge's bench.
44Ac 18:13 "This man," they said, "persuades people to worship God contrary to the law!"
44Ac 18:14 And as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of a crime or of moral evil, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you Jews.
44Ac 18:15 But if these are questions about words, names, and your own law, see to it yourselves. I don't want to be a judge of such things."
44Ac 18:16 So he drove them from the judge's bench.
44Ac 18:17 Then they all seized Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judge's bench. But none of these things concerned Gallio.
44Ac 18:18 So Paul, having stayed on for many days, said good-bye to the brothers and sailed away to Syria. Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He shaved his head at Cenchreae, because he had taken a vow.
44Ac 18:19 When they reached Ephesus he left them there, but he himself entered the synagogue and engaged in discussion with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 And though they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined,
44Ac 18:21 but said good-bye and stated, "I'll come back to you again, if God wills." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44Ac 18:22 On landing at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.
44Ac 18:23 He set out, traveling through one place after another in the Galatian territory and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44Ac 18:24 A Jew named Apollos, a native Alexandrian, an eloquent man who was powerful in the Scriptures, arrived in Ephesus.
44Ac 18:25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught the things about Jesus accurately, although he knew only John's baptism.
44Ac 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. After Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the way of God to him more accurately.
44Ac 18:27 When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples urging them to welcome him. After he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace.
44Ac 18:28 For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.
44Ac 19:1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples
44Ac 19:2 and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" "No," they told him, "we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44Ac 19:3 "Then with what [baptism] were you baptized?" he asked them. "With John's baptism," they replied.
44Ac 19:4 Paul said, "John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the One who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak with [other] languages and to prophesy.
44Ac 19:7 Now there were about 12 men in all.
44Ac 19:8 Then he entered the synagogue and spoke boldly over a period of three months, engaging in discussion and trying to persuade them about the things related to the kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But when some became hardened and would not believe, slandering the Way in front of the crowd, he withdrew from them and met separately with the disciples, conducting discussions every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 And this went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of the province of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.
44Ac 19:11 God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul's hands,
44Ac 19:12 so that even facecloths or work aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, and the diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
44Ac 19:13 Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I command you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches!"
44Ac 19:14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
44Ac 19:15 The evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize-- but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 Then the man who had the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they ran out of that house naked and wounded.
44Ac 19:17 This became known to everyone who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Then fear fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
44Ac 19:18 And many who had become believers came confessing and disclosing their practices,
44Ac 19:19 while many of those who had practiced magic collected their books and burned them in front of everyone. So they calculated their value, and found it to be 50,000 pieces of silver.
44Ac 19:20 In this way the Lord's message flourished and prevailed.
44Ac 19:21 When these events were over, Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem. "After I've been there," he said, "I must see Rome as well!"
44Ac 19:22 So after sending two of those who assisted him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed in the province of Asia for a while.
44Ac 19:23 During that time there was a major disturbance about the Way.
44Ac 19:24 For a person named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, provided a great deal of business for the craftsmen.
44Ac 19:25 When he had assembled them, as well as the workers engaged in this type of business, he said: "Men, you know that our prosperity is derived from this business.
44Ac 19:26 You both see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost the whole province of Asia, this man Paul has persuaded and misled a considerable number of people by saying that gods made by hand are not gods!
44Ac 19:27 So not only do we run a risk that our business may be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and her magnificence come to the verge of ruin-- the very one whom the whole province of Asia and the world adore."
44Ac 19:28 When they had heard this, they were filled with rage and began to cry out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 So the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed all together into the amphitheater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's traveling companions.
44Ac 19:30 Though Paul wanted to go in before the people, the disciples did not let him.
44Ac 19:31 Even some of the provincial officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent word to him, pleading with him not to take a chance by going into the amphitheater.
44Ac 19:32 Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing and some another, because the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
44Ac 19:33 Then some of the crowd gave Alexander advice when the Jews pushed him to the front. So motioning with his hand, Alexander wanted to make his defense to the people.
44Ac 19:34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a united cry went up from all of them for about two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:35 However, when the city clerk had calmed the crowd down, he said, "Men of Ephesus! What man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple guardian of the great Artemis, and of the image that fell from heaven?
44Ac 19:36 Therefore, since these things are undeniable, you must keep calm and not do anything rash.
44Ac 19:37 For you have brought these men here who are not temple robbers or blasphemers of our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 So if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a case against anyone, the courts are in session, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
44Ac 19:39 But if you want something else, it must be decided in a legal assembly.
44Ac 19:40 In fact, we run a risk of being charged with rioting for what happened today, since there is no justification that we can give as a reason for this disorderly gathering."
44Ac 19:41 After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
44Ac 20:1 After the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples, encouraged them, and after saying good-bye, departed to go to Macedonia.
44Ac 20:2 And when he had passed through those areas and exhorted them at length, he came to Greece
44Ac 20:3 and stayed three months. When he was about to set sail for Syria, a plot was devised against him by the Jews, so a decision was made to go back through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 He was accompanied by Sopater, son of Pyrrhus, from Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
44Ac 20:5 These men went on ahead and waited for us in Troas,
44Ac 20:6 but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread. In five days we reached them at Troas, where we spent seven days.
44Ac 20:7 On the first day of the week, we assembled to break bread. Paul spoke to them, and since he was about to depart the next day, he extended his message until midnight.
44Ac 20:8 There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were assembled,
44Ac 20:9 and a young man named Eutychus was sitting on a window sill and sank into a deep sleep as Paul kept on speaking. When he was overcome by sleep he fell down from the third story, and was picked up dead.
44Ac 20:10 But Paul went down, threw himself on him, embraced him, and said, "Don't be alarmed, for his life is in him!"
44Ac 20:11 After going upstairs, breaking the bread, and eating, he conversed a considerable time until dawn. Then he left.
44Ac 20:12 They brought the boy home alive and were greatly comforted.
44Ac 20:13 Then we went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, from there intending to take Paul on board. For these were his instructions, since he himself was going by land.
44Ac 20:14 When he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 Sailing from there, the next day we arrived off Chios. The following day we crossed over to Samos, and the day after, we came to Miletus.
44Ac 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so he would not have to spend time in the province of Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, for the day of Pentecost.
44Ac 20:17 Now from Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
44Ac 20:18 And when they came to him, he said to them: "You know, from the first day I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time--
44Ac 20:19 serving the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with the trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews--
44Ac 20:20 and that I did not shrink back from proclaiming to you anything that was profitable, or from teaching it to you in public and from house to house.
44Ac 20:21 I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
44Ac 20:22 "And now I am on my way to Jerusalem, bound in my spirit, not knowing what I will encounter there,
44Ac 20:23 except that in town after town the Holy Spirit testifies to me that chains and afflictions are waiting for me.
44Ac 20:24 But I count my life of no value to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God's grace.
44Ac 20:25 "And now I know that none of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see my face again.
44Ac 20:26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of everyone's blood,
44Ac 20:27 for I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole plan of God.
44Ac 20:28 Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.
44Ac 20:29 I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
44Ac 20:30 And men from among yourselves will rise up with deviant doctrines to lure the disciples into following them.
44Ac 20:31 Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears.
44Ac 20:32 "And now I commit you to God and to the message of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.
44Ac 20:33 I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.
44Ac 20:34 You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my needs, and for those who were with me.
44Ac 20:35 In every way I've shown you that by laboring like this, it is necessary to help the weak and to keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, for He said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 After he said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.
44Ac 20:37 There was a great deal of weeping by everyone. And embracing Paul, they kissed him,
44Ac 20:38 grieving most of all over his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.
44Ac 21:1 After we tore ourselves away from them and set sail, we came by a direct route to Cos, the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
44Ac 21:2 Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we boarded and set sail.
44Ac 21:3 After we sighted Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we sailed on to Syria and arrived at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.
44Ac 21:4 So we found some disciples and stayed there seven days. They said to Paul through the Spirit not to go to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:5 When our days there were over, we left to continue our journey, while all of them, with their wives and children, escorted us out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach to pray,
44Ac 21:6 we said good-bye to one another. Then we boarded the ship, and they returned home.
44Ac 21:7 When we completed our voyage from Tyre, we reached Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day.
44Ac 21:8 The next day we left and came to Caesarea, where we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.
44Ac 21:9 This man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
44Ac 21:10 While we were staying there many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 He came to us, took Paul's belt, tied his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver him into Gentile hands.'"
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, both we and the local people begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 Then Paul replied, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 21:14 Since he would not be persuaded, we stopped talking and simply said, "The Lord's will be done!"
44Ac 21:15 After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us and brought us to Mnason, a Cypriot and an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.
44Ac 21:17 When we reached Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.
44Ac 21:18 The following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
44Ac 21:19 After greeting them, he related one by one what God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 When they heard it, they glorified God and said, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
44Ac 21:21 But they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, by telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk in our customs.
44Ac 21:22 So what is to be done? They will certainly hear that you've come.
44Ac 21:23 Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have obligated themselves with a vow.
44Ac 21:24 Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and pay for them to get their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that what they were told about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself are also careful about observing the law.
44Ac 21:25 With regard to the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter containing our decision that they should keep themselves from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality."
44Ac 21:26 Then the next day, Paul took the men, having purified himself along with them, and entered the temple, announcing the completion of the purification days when the offering for each of them would be made.
44Ac 21:27 As the seven days were about to end, the Jews from the province of Asia saw him in the temple complex, stirred up the whole crowd, and seized him,
44Ac 21:28 shouting, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place. What's more, he also brought Greeks into the temple and has profaned this holy place."
44Ac 21:29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple complex.
44Ac 21:30 The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul, dragged him out of the temple complex, and at once the gates were shut.
44Ac 21:31 As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the commander of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in chaos.
44Ac 21:32 Taking along soldiers and centurions, he immediately ran down to them. Seeing the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44Ac 21:33 Then the commander came up, took him into custody, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He asked who he was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 Some in the mob were shouting one thing and some another. Since he was not able to get reliable information because of the uproar, he ordered him to be taken into the barracks.
44Ac 21:35 When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the mob's violence,
44Ac 21:36 for the mass of people were following and yelling, "Kill him!"
44Ac 21:37 As he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, "Am I allowed to say something to you?" He replied, "Do you know Greek?
44Ac 21:38 Aren't you the Egyptian who raised a rebellion some time ago and led 4,000 Assassins into the desert?"
44Ac 21:39 Paul said, "I am a Jewish man from Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of an important city. Now I ask you, let me speak to the people."
44Ac 21:40 After he had given permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people. When there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language:
44Ac 22:1 "Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense before you."
44Ac 22:2 When they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even quieter.
44Ac 22:3 He continued, "I am a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and educated according to the strict view of our patriarchal law. Being zealous for God, just as all of you are today,
44Ac 22:4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women in jail,
44Ac 22:5 as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. Having received letters from them to the brothers, I was traveling to Damascus to bring those who were prisoners there to be punished in Jerusalem.
44Ac 22:6 "As I was traveling and near Damascus, about noon an intense light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.
44Ac 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'
44Ac 22:8 "I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' "He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting!'
44Ac 22:9 Now those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
44Ac 22:10 "Then I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' "And the Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything that is assigned for you to do.'
44Ac 22:11 "Since I couldn't see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
44Ac 22:12 Someone named Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good reputation with all the Jews residing there,
44Ac 22:13 came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And in that very hour I looked up and saw him.
44Ac 22:14 Then he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of His voice.
44Ac 22:15 For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 And now, why delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins by calling on His name.'
44Ac 22:17 "After I came back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple complex, I went into a visionary state
44Ac 22:18 and saw Him telling me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me!'
44Ac 22:19 "But I said, 'Lord, they know that in synagogue after synagogue I had those who believed in You imprisoned and beaten.
44Ac 22:20 And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving, and I guarded the clothes of those who killed him.'
44Ac 22:21 "Then He said to me, 'Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 22:22 They listened to him up to this word. Then they raised their voices, shouting, "Wipe this person off the earth-- it's a disgrace for him to live!"
44Ac 22:23 As they were yelling and flinging aside their robes and throwing dust into the air,
44Ac 22:24 the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, directing that he be examined with the scourge, so he could discover the reason they were shouting against him like this.
44Ac 22:25 As they stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing by, "Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and is uncondemned?"
44Ac 22:26 When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, "What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."
44Ac 22:27 The commander came and said to him, "Tell me-- are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.
44Ac 22:28 The commander replied, "I bought this citizenship for a large amount of money." "But I myself was born a citizen," Paul said.
44Ac 22:29 Therefore, those who were about to examine him withdrew from him at once. The commander too was alarmed when he realized Paul was a Roman citizen and he had bound him.
44Ac 22:30 The next day, since he wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and instructed the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to convene. Then he brought Paul down and placed him before them.
44Ac 23:1 Paul looked intently at the Sanhedrin and said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience until this day."
44Ac 23:2 But the high priest Ananias ordered those who were standing next to him to strike him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! You are sitting there judging me according to the law, and in violation of the law are you ordering me to be struck?"
44Ac 23:4 And those standing nearby said, "Do you dare revile God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 "I did not know, brothers," Paul said, "that it was the high priest. For it is written, You must not speak evil of a ruler of your people."
44Ac 23:6 When Paul realized that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part were Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees! I am being judged because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead!"
44Ac 23:7 When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44Ac 23:8 For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, and no angel or spirit, but the Pharisees affirm them all.
44Ac 23:9 The shouting grew loud, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party got up and argued vehemently: "We find nothing evil in this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44Ac 23:10 When the dispute became violent, the commander feared that Paul might be torn apart by them and ordered the troops to go down, rescue him from them, and bring him into the barracks.
44Ac 23:11 The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, "Have courage! For as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."
44Ac 23:12 When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under a curse: neither to eat nor to drink until they had killed Paul.
44Ac 23:13 There were more than 40 who had formed this plot.
44Ac 23:14 These men went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn curse that we won't eat anything until we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 So now you, along with the Sanhedrin, make a request to the commander that he bring him down to you as if you were going to investigate his case more thoroughly. However, before he gets near, we are ready to kill him."
44Ac 23:16 But the son of Paul's sister, hearing about their ambush, came and entered the barracks and reported it to Paul.
44Ac 23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander, because he has something to report to him."
44Ac 23:18 So he took him, brought him to the commander, and said, "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you."
44Ac 23:19 Then the commander took him by the hand, led him aside, and inquired privately, "What is it you have to report to me?"
44Ac 23:20 "The Jews," he said, "have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they are going to hold a somewhat more careful inquiry about him.
44Ac 23:21 Don't let them persuade you, because there are more than 40 of them arranging to ambush him, men who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they kill him. Now they are ready, waiting for a commitment from you."
44Ac 23:22 So the commander dismissed the young man and instructed him, "Don't tell anyone that you have informed me about this."
44Ac 23:23 He summoned two of his centurions and said, "Get 200 soldiers ready with 70 cavalry and 200 spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
44Ac 23:24 Also provide mounts so they can put Paul on them and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
44Ac 23:25 He wrote a letter of this kind:
44Ac 23:26 Claudius Lysias, To the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
44Ac 23:27 When this man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, I arrived with my troops and rescued him because I learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44Ac 23:28 Wanting to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down before their Sanhedrin.
44Ac 23:29 I found out that the accusations were about disputed matters in their law, and that there was no charge that merited death or chains.
44Ac 23:30 When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you right away. I also ordered his accusers to state their case against him in your presence.
44Ac 23:31 Therefore, during the night, the soldiers took Paul and brought him to Antipatris as they were ordered.
44Ac 23:32 The next day, they returned to the barracks, allowing the cavalry to go on with him.
44Ac 23:33 When these men entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
44Ac 23:34 After he read it, he asked what province he was from. So when he learned he was from Cilicia,
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will give you a hearing whenever your accusers get here too." And he ordered that he be kept under guard in Herod's palace.
44Ac 24:1 After five days Ananias the high priest came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. These men presented their case against Paul to the governor.
44Ac 24:2 When he was called in, Tertullus began to accuse him and said: "Since we enjoy great peace because of you, and reforms are taking place for the benefit of this nation by your foresight,
44Ac 24:3 we gratefully receive them always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
44Ac 24:4 However, so that I will not burden you any further, I beg you in your graciousness to give us a brief hearing.
44Ac 24:5 For we have found this man to be a plague, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the Roman world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes!
44Ac 24:6 He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we apprehended him [[and wanted to judge him according to our law.
44Ac 24:7 But Lysias the commander came and took him from our hands, commanding his accusers to come to you.]]
44Ac 24:8 By examining him yourself you will be able to discern all these things of which we accuse him."
44Ac 24:9 The Jews also joined in the attack, alleging that these things were so.
44Ac 24:10 When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied: "Because I know you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I am glad to offer my defense in what concerns me.
44Ac 24:11 You are able to determine that it is no more than 12 days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
44Ac 24:12 And they didn't find me disputing with anyone or causing a disturbance among the crowd, either in the temple complex or in the synagogues, or anywhere in the city.
44Ac 24:13 Neither can they provide evidence to you of what they now bring against me.
44Ac 24:14 But I confess this to you: that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I worship my fathers' God, believing all the things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.
44Ac 24:15 And I have a hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there is going to be a resurrection, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
44Ac 24:16 I always do my best to have a clear conscience toward God and men.
44Ac 24:17 After many years, I came to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my nation,
44Ac 24:18 and while I was doing this, some Jews from the province of Asia found me ritually purified in the temple, without a crowd and without any uproar.
44Ac 24:19 It is they who ought to be here before you to bring charges, if they have anything against me.
44Ac 24:20 Either let these men here state what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
44Ac 24:21 or about this one statement I cried out while standing among them, 'Today I am being judged before you concerning the resurrection of the dead.'"
44Ac 24:22 Since Felix was accurately informed about the Way, he adjourned the hearing, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."
44Ac 24:23 He ordered that the centurion keep Paul under guard, though he could have some freedom, and that he should not prevent any of his friends from serving him.
44Ac 24:24 After some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and listened to him on the subject of faith in Christ Jesus.
44Ac 24:25 Now as he spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and replied, "Leave for now, but when I find time I'll call for you."
44Ac 24:26 At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul. For this reason he sent for him quite often and conversed with him.
44Ac 24:27 After two years had passed, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus, and because he wished to do a favor for the Jews, Felix left Paul in prison.
44Ac 25:1 Three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
44Ac 25:2 Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews presented their case against Paul to him; and they appealed,
44Ac 25:3 asking him to do them a favor against Paul, that he might summon him to Jerusalem. They were preparing an ambush along the road to kill him.
44Ac 25:4 However, Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to go there shortly.
44Ac 25:5 "Therefore," he said, "let the men of authority among you go down with me and accuse him, if there is any wrong in this man."
44Ac 25:6 When he had spent not more than eight or 10 days among them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day, seated at the judge's bench, he commanded Paul to be brought in.
44Ac 25:7 When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges that they were not able to prove,
44Ac 25:8 while Paul made the defense that, "Neither against the Jewish law, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned at all."
44Ac 25:9 Then Festus, wanting to do a favor for the Jews, replied to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be tried before me on these charges?"
44Ac 25:10 But Paul said: "I am standing at Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as even you can see very well.
44Ac 25:11 If then I am doing wrong, or have done anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die, but if there is nothing to what these men accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
44Ac 25:12 After Festus conferred with his council, he replied, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you will go!"
44Ac 25:13 After some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and paid a courtesy call on Festus.
44Ac 25:14 Since they stayed there many days, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, saying, "There's a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix.
44Ac 25:15 When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented their case and asked for a judgment against him.
44Ac 25:16 I answered them that it's not the Romans' custom to give any man up before the accused confronts the accusers face to face and has an opportunity to give a defense concerning the charge.
44Ac 25:17 Therefore, when they had assembled here, I did not delay. The next day I sat at the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.
44Ac 25:18 Concerning him, the accusers stood up and brought no charge of the sort I was expecting.
44Ac 25:19 Instead they had some disagreements with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, a dead man whom Paul claimed to be alive.
44Ac 25:20 Since I was at a loss in a dispute over such things, I asked him if he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there concerning these matters.
44Ac 25:21 But when Paul appealed to be held for trial by the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar."
44Ac 25:22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him."
44Ac 25:23 So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the auditorium with the commanders and prominent men of the city. When Festus gave the command, Paul was brought in.
44Ac 25:24 Then Festus said: "King Agrippa and all men present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish community has appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he should not live any longer.
44Ac 25:25 Now I realized that he had not done anything deserving of death, but when he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
44Ac 25:26 I have nothing definite to write to the Emperor about him. Therefore, I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this examination is over, I may have something to write.
44Ac 25:27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to indicate the charges against him."
44Ac 26:1 Agrippa said to Paul, "It is permitted for you to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:
44Ac 26:2 "I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that today I am going to make a defense before you about everything I am accused of by the Jews,
44Ac 26:3 especially since you are an expert in all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44Ac 26:4 "All the Jews know my way of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem.
44Ac 26:5 They had previously known me for quite some time, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
44Ac 26:6 And now I stand on trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,
44Ac 26:7 [the promise] our 12 tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve Him night and day. Because of this hope I am being accused by the Jews, O king!
44Ac 26:8 Why is it considered incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
44Ac 26:9 In fact, I myself supposed it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
44Ac 26:10 This I actually did in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the saints in prison, since I had received authority for that from the chief priests. When they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
44Ac 26:11 In all the synagogues I often tried to make them blaspheme by punishing them. Being greatly enraged at them, I even pursued them to foreign cities.
44Ac 26:12 "Under these circumstances I was traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.
44Ac 26:13 At midday, while on the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me.
44Ac 26:14 When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44Ac 26:15 "But I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' "And the Lord replied: 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 26:16 But get up and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and a witness of things you have seen, and of things in which I will appear to you.
44Ac 26:17 I will rescue you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,
44Ac 26:18 to open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.'
44Ac 26:19 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
44Ac 26:20 Instead, I preached to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem and in all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
44Ac 26:21 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple complex and were trying to kill me.
44Ac 26:22 Since I have obtained help that comes from God, to this day I stand and testify to both small and great, saying nothing else than what the prophets and Moses said would take place--
44Ac 26:23 that the Messiah must suffer, and that as the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."
44Ac 26:24 As he was making his defense this way, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, "You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much study is driving you mad!"
44Ac 26:25 But Paul replied, "I'm not out of my mind, most excellent Festus. On the contrary, I'm speaking words of truth and good judgment.
44Ac 26:26 For the king knows about these matters. It is to him I am actually speaking boldly. For I'm not convinced that any of these things escapes his notice, since this was not done in a corner!
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe."
44Ac 26:28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Are you going to persuade me to become a Christian so easily?"
44Ac 26:29 "I wish before God," replied Paul, "that whether easily or with difficulty, not only you but all who listen to me today might become as I am-- except for these chains."
44Ac 26:30 So the king, the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them got up,
44Ac 26:31 and when they had left they talked with each other and said, "This man is doing nothing that deserves death or chains."
44Ac 26:32 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44Ac 27:1 When it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Imperial Regiment.
44Ac 27:2 So when we had boarded a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail to ports along the coast of the province of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.
44Ac 27:3 The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care.
44Ac 27:4 When we had put out to sea from there, we sailed along the northern coast of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44Ac 27:5 After sailing through the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
44Ac 27:7 Sailing slowly for many days, we came with difficulty as far as Cnidus. But since the wind did not allow us to approach it, we sailed along the south side of Crete off Salmone.
44Ac 27:8 With yet more difficulty we sailed along the coast, and came to a place called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 By now much time had passed, and the voyage was already dangerous. Since the Fast was already over, Paul gave his advice
44Ac 27:10 and told them, "Men, I can see that this voyage is headed toward damage and heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44Ac 27:11 But the centurion paid attention to the captain and the owner of the ship rather than to what Paul said.
44Ac 27:12 Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to set sail from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenix, a harbor on Crete open to the southwest and northwest, and to winter there.
44Ac 27:13 When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they had achieved their purpose; they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
44Ac 27:14 But not long afterwards, a fierce wind called the "northeaster" rushed down from the island.
44Ac 27:15 Since the ship was caught and was unable to head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.
44Ac 27:16 After running under the shelter of a little island called Cauda, we were barely able to get control of the skiff.
44Ac 27:17 After hoisting it up, they used ropes and tackle and girded the ship. Then, fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the drift-anchor, and in this way they were driven along.
44Ac 27:18 Because we were being severely battered by the storm, they began to jettison the cargo the next day.
44Ac 27:19 On the third day, they threw the ship's gear overboard with their own hands.
44Ac 27:20 For many days neither sun nor stars appeared, and the severe storm kept raging; finally all hope that we would be saved was disappearing.
44Ac 27:21 Since many were going without food, Paul stood up among them and said, "You men should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete and sustain this damage and loss.
44Ac 27:22 Now I urge you to take courage, because there will be no loss of any of your lives, but only of the ship.
44Ac 27:23 For this night an angel of the God I belong to and serve stood by me,
44Ac 27:24 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. And, look! God has graciously given you all those who are sailing with you.'
44Ac 27:25 Therefore, take courage, men, because I believe God that it will be just the way it was told to me.
44Ac 27:26 However, we must run aground on a certain island."
44Ac 27:27 When the fourteenth night came, we were drifting in the Adriatic Sea, and in the middle of the night the sailors thought they were approaching land.
44Ac 27:28 They took a sounding and found it to be 120 feet deep; when they had sailed a little farther and sounded again, they found it to be 90 feet deep.
44Ac 27:29 Then, fearing we might run aground in some rocky place, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight to come.
44Ac 27:30 Some sailors tried to escape from the ship; they had let down the skiff into the sea, pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow.
44Ac 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 27:32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the skiff and let it drop away.
44Ac 27:33 When it was just about daylight, Paul urged them all to take food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing.
44Ac 27:34 Therefore I urge you to take some food. For this has to do with your survival, since not a hair will be lost from the head of any of you."
44Ac 27:35 After he said these things and had taken some bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of them all, and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
44Ac 27:36 They all became encouraged and took food themselves.
44Ac 27:37 In all there were 276 of us on the ship.
44Ac 27:38 And having eaten enough food, they began to lighten the ship by throwing the grain overboard into the sea.
44Ac 27:39 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but sighted a bay with a beach. They planned to run the ship ashore if they could.
44Ac 27:40 After casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and headed for the beach.
44Ac 27:41 But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow jammed fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up with the pounding of the waves.
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners so that no one could swim off and escape.
44Ac 27:43 But the centurion kept them from carrying out their plan because he wanted to save Paul, so he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
44Ac 27:44 The rest were to follow, some on planks and some on debris from the ship. In this way, all got safely to land.
44Ac 28:1 Safely ashore, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
44Ac 28:2 The local people showed us extraordinary kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all in, since rain was falling and it was cold.
44Ac 28:3 As Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself to his hand.
44Ac 28:4 When the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "This man is probably a murderer, and though he has escaped the sea, Justice does not allow him to live!"
44Ac 28:5 However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
44Ac 28:6 They expected that he would swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after they waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
44Ac 28:7 Now in the area around that place was an estate belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
44Ac 28:8 It happened that Publius' father was in bed suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, and praying and laying his hands on him, he healed him.
44Ac 28:9 After this, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
44Ac 28:10 So they heaped many honors on us, and when we sailed, they gave us what we needed.
44Ac 28:11 After three months we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, with the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.
44Ac 28:12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed three days.
44Ac 28:13 From there, after making a circuit along the coast, we reached Rhegium. After one day a south wind sprang up, and the second day we came to Puteoli.
44Ac 28:14 There we found believers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
44Ac 28:15 Now the believers from there had heard the news about us and had come to meet us as far as Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
44Ac 28:16 And when we entered Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
44Ac 28:17 After three days he called together the leaders of the Jews. And when they had gathered he said to them: "Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our forefathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans
44Ac 28:18 who, after examining me, wanted to release me, since I had not committed a capital offense.
44Ac 28:19 Because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar; it was not as though I had any accusation against my nation.
44Ac 28:20 So, for this reason I've asked to see you and speak to you. In fact, it is for the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this chain."
44Ac 28:21 And they said to him, "We haven't received any letters about you from Judea; none of the brothers has come and reported or spoken anything evil about you.
44Ac 28:22 But we consider it suitable to hear from you what you think. For concerning this sect, we are aware that it is spoken against everywhere."
44Ac 28:23 After arranging a day with him, many came to him at his lodging. From dawn to dusk he expounded and witnessed about the kingdom of God. He persuaded them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
44Ac 28:24 Some were persuaded by what he said, but others did not believe.
44Ac 28:25 Disagreeing among themselves, they began to leave after Paul made one statement: "The Holy Spirit correctly spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your forefathers
44Ac 28:26 when He said, Go to this people and say: 'You will listen and listen, yet never understand; and you will look and look, yet never perceive.
44Ac 28:27 For this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be converted-- and I would heal them.'
44Ac 28:28 Therefore, let it be known to you that this saving work of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen!"
44Ac 28:29 [[After he said these things, the Jews departed, while engaging in a prolonged debate among themselves.]]
44Ac 28:30 Then he stayed two whole years in his own rented house. And he welcomed all who visited him,
44Ac 28:31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with full boldness and without hindrance.
45
45Rm 1:1 Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle and singled out for God's good news--
45Rm 1:2 which He promised long ago through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures--
45Rm 1:3 concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh
45Rm 1:4 and was established as the powerful Son of God by the resurrection from the dead according to the Spirit of holiness.
45Rm 1:5 We have received grace and apostleship through Him to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations, on behalf of His name,
45Rm 1:6 including yourselves who are also Jesus Christ's by calling:
45Rm 1:7 To all who are in Rome, loved by God, called as saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith is being reported in all the world.
45Rm 1:9 For God, whom I serve with my spirit in [telling] the good news about His Son, is my witness that I constantly mention you,
45Rm 1:10 always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God's will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
45Rm 1:11 For I want very much to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you,
45Rm 1:12 that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
45Rm 1:13 Now I want you to know, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now) in order that I might have a fruitful ministry among you, just as among the rest of the Gentiles.
45Rm 1:14 I am obligated both to Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and the foolish.
45Rm 1:15 So I am eager to preach the good news to you also who are in Rome.
45Rm 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.
45Rm 1:17 For in it God's righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, just as it is written: The righteous will live by faith.
45Rm 1:18 For God's wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth,
45Rm 1:19 since what can be known about God is evident among them, because God has shown it to them.
45Rm 1:20 From the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what He has made. As a result, people are without excuse.
45Rm 1:21 For though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became nonsense, and their senseless minds were darkened.
45Rm 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools
45Rm 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.
45Rm 1:24 Therefore God delivered them over in the cravings of their hearts to sexual impurity, so that their bodies were degraded among themselves.
45Rm 1:25 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served something created instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
45Rm 1:26 This is why God delivered them over to degrading passions. For even their females exchanged natural sexual intercourse for what is unnatural.
45Rm 1:27 The males in the same way also left natural sexual intercourse with females and were inflamed in their lust for one another. Males committed shameless acts with males and received in their own persons the appropriate penalty for their perversion.
45Rm 1:28 And because they did not think it worthwhile to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them over to a worthless mind to do what is morally wrong.
45Rm 1:29 They are filled with all unrighteousness, evil, greed, and wickedness. They are full of envy, murder, disputes, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,
45Rm 1:30 slanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
45Rm 1:31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, and unmerciful.
45Rm 1:32 Although they know full well God's just sentence-- that those who practice such things deserve to die-- they not only do them, but even applaud others who practice them.
45Rm 2:1 Therefore, anyone of you who judges is without excuse. For when you judge another, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, do the same things.
45Rm 2:2 We know that God's judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth.
45Rm 2:3 Do you really think-- anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same-- that you will escape God's judgment?
45Rm 2:4 Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, restraint, and patience, not recognizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
45Rm 2:5 But because of your hardness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment is revealed.
45Rm 2:6 He will repay each one according to his works:
45Rm 2:7 eternal life to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality;
45Rm 2:8 but wrath and indignation to those who are self-seeking and disobey the truth, but are obeying unrighteousness;
45Rm 2:9 affliction and distress for every human being who does evil, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek;
45Rm 2:10 but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.
45Rm 2:11 There is no favoritism with God.
45Rm 2:12 All those who sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all those who sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
45Rm 2:13 For the hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.
45Rm 2:14 So, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, instinctively do what the law demands, they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law.
45Rm 2:15 They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts. Their consciences testify in support of this, and their competing thoughts either accuse or excuse them
45Rm 2:16 on the day when God judges what people have kept secret, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus.
45Rm 2:17 Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rest in the law, and boast in God,
45Rm 2:18 and know His will, and approve the things that are superior, being instructed from the law,
45Rm 2:19 and are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,
45Rm 2:20 an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of the immature, having in the law the full expression of knowledge and truth--
45Rm 2:21 you then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach, "You must not steal"-- do you steal?
45Rm 2:22 You who say, "You must not commit adultery"-- do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob their temples?
45Rm 2:23 You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45Rm 2:24 For, as it is written: The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.
45Rm 2:25 For circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
45Rm 2:26 Therefore if an uncircumcised man keeps the law's requirements, will his uncircumcision not be counted as circumcision?
45Rm 2:27 A man who is physically uncircumcised, but who fulfills the law, will judge you who are a lawbreaker in spite of having the letter [of the law] and circumcision.
45Rm 2:28 For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, and [true] circumcision is not something visible in the flesh.
45Rm 2:29 On the contrary, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart-- by the Spirit, not the letter. His praise is not from men but from God.
45Rm 3:1 So what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
45Rm 3:2 Considerable in every way. First, they were entrusted with the spoken words of God.
45Rm 3:3 What then? If some did not believe, will their unbelief cancel God's faithfulness?
45Rm 3:4 Absolutely not! God must be true, but everyone is a liar, as it is written: That You may be justified in Your words and triumph when You judge.
45Rm 3:5 But if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, what are we to say? I use a human argument: Is God unrighteous to inflict wrath?
45Rm 3:6 Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?
45Rm 3:7 But if by my lie God's truth is amplified to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
45Rm 3:8 And why not say, just as some people slanderously claim we say, "Let us do evil so that good may come"? Their condemnation is deserved!
45Rm 3:9 What then? Are we any better? Not at all! For we have previously charged that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin,
45Rm 3:10 as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one;
45Rm 3:11 there is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks God.
45Rm 3:12 All have turned away, together they have become useless; there is no one who does good, there is not even one.
45Rm 3:13 Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues. Vipers' venom is under their lips.
45Rm 3:14 Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
45Rm 3:15 Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45Rm 3:16 ruin and wretchedness are in their paths,
45Rm 3:17 and the path of peace they have not known.
45Rm 3:18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that whatever the law says speaks to those who are subject to the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may become subject to God's judgment.
45Rm 3:20 For no flesh will be justified in His sight by the works of the law, for through the law [comes] the knowledge of sin.
45Rm 3:21 But now, apart from the law, God's righteousness has been revealed-- attested by the Law and the Prophets
45Rm 3:22 -- that is, God's righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ, to all who believe, since there is no distinction.
45Rm 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
45Rm 3:24 They are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 3:25 God presented Him as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His restraint God passed over the sins previously committed.
45Rm 3:26 He presented Him to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be righteous and declare righteous the one who has faith in Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By one of works? No, on the contrary, by a law of faith.
45Rm 3:28 For we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law.
45Rm 3:29 Or is God for Jews only? Is He not also for Gentiles? Yes, for Gentiles too,
45Rm 3:30 since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
45Rm 3:31 Do we then cancel the law through faith? Absolutely not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
45Rm 4:1 What then can we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?
45Rm 4:2 If Abraham was justified by works, then he has something to brag about-- but not before God.
45Rm 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.
45Rm 4:4 Now to the one who works, pay is not considered as a gift, but as something owed.
45Rm 4:5 But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who declares righteous the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness.
45Rm 4:6 Likewise, David also speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
45Rm 4:7 How happy those whose lawless acts are forgiven and whose sins are covered!
45Rm 4:8 How happy the man whom the Lord will never charge with sin!
45Rm 4:9 Is this blessing only for the circumcised, then? Or is it also for the uncircumcised? For we say, Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.
45Rm 4:10 How then was it credited-- while he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while he was circumcised, but uncircumcised.
45Rm 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while still uncircumcised. This was to make him the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, so that righteousness may be credited to them also.
45Rm 4:12 And he became the father of the circumcised, not only to those who are circumcised, but also to those who follow in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had while still uncircumcised.
45Rm 4:13 For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
45Rm 4:14 If those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made empty and the promise is canceled.
45Rm 4:15 For the law produces wrath; but where there is no law, there is no transgression.
45Rm 4:16 This is why the promise is by faith, so that it may be according to grace, to guarantee it to all the descendants-- not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of Abraham's faith. He is the father of us all
45Rm 4:17 in God's sight. As it is written: I have made you the father of many nations. He believed in God, who gives life to the dead and calls things into existence that do not exist.
45Rm 4:18 Against hope, with hope he believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what had been spoken: So will your descendants be.
45Rm 4:19 He considered his own body to be already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb, without weakening in the faith.
45Rm 4:20 He did not waver in unbelief at God's promise, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
45Rm 4:21 because he was fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.
45Rm 4:22 Therefore, it was credited to him for righteousness.
45Rm 4:23 Now it was credited to him was not written for Abraham alone,
45Rm 4:24 but also for us. It will be credited to us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45Rm 4:25 He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
45Rm 5:1 Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:2 Also through Him, we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
45Rm 5:3 And not only that, but we also rejoice in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance,
45Rm 5:4 endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope.
45Rm 5:5 This hope does not disappoint, because God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
45Rm 5:6 For while we were still helpless, at the appointed moment, Christ died for the ungodly.
45Rm 5:7 For rarely will someone die for a just person-- though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die.
45Rm 5:8 But God proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us!
45Rm 5:9 Much more then, since we have now been declared righteous by His blood, we will be saved through Him from wrath.
45Rm 5:10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, [then how] much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by His life!
45Rm 5:11 And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45Rm 5:12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, in this way death spread to all men, because all sinned.
45Rm 5:13 In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to one's account when there is no law.
45Rm 5:14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression. He is a prototype of the Coming One.
45Rm 5:15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man's trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift overflowed to the many by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:16 And the gift is not like the one man's sin, because from one sin came the judgment, resulting in condemnation, but from many trespasses came the gift, resulting in justification.
45Rm 5:17 Since by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:18 So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is life-giving justification for everyone.
45Rm 5:19 For just as through one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 The law came along to multiply the trespass. But where sin multiplied, grace multiplied even more,
45Rm 5:21 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness, resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 What should we say then? Should we continue in sin in order that grace may multiply?
45Rm 6:2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
45Rm 6:3 Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
45Rm 6:4 Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in a new way of life.
45Rm 6:5 For if we have been joined with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be in the likeness of His resurrection.
45Rm 6:6 For we know that our old self was crucified with Him in order that sin's dominion over the body may be abolished, so that we may no longer be enslaved to sin,
45Rm 6:7 since a person who has died is freed from sin's claims.
45Rm 6:8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him,
45Rm 6:9 because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies. Death no longer rules over Him.
45Rm 6:10 For in that He died, He died to sin once for all; but in that He lives, He lives to God.
45Rm 6:11 So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires.
45Rm 6:13 And do not offer any parts of it to sin as weapons for unrighteousness. But as those who are alive from the dead, offer yourselves to God, and all the parts of yourselves to God as weapons for righteousness.
45Rm 6:14 For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under law but under grace.
45Rm 6:15 What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not!
45Rm 6:16 Do you not know that if you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of that one you obey-- either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness?
45Rm 6:17 But thank God that, although you used to be slaves of sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to,
45Rm 6:18 and having been liberated from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.
45Rm 6:19 I am using a human analogy because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you offered the parts of yourselves as slaves to moral impurity, and to greater and greater lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness, which results in sanctification.
45Rm 6:20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from allegiance to righteousness.
45Rm 6:21 And what fruit was produced then from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death.
45Rm 6:22 But now, since you have been liberated from sin and become enslaved to God, you have your fruit, which results in sanctification-- and the end is eternal life!
45Rm 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 7:1 Since I am speaking to those who understand law, brothers, are you unaware that the law has authority over someone as long as he lives?
45Rm 7:2 For example, a married woman is legally bound to her husband while he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law regarding the husband.
45Rm 7:3 So then, if she gives herself to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then, if she gives herself to another man, she is not an adulteress.
45Rm 7:4 Therefore, my brothers, you also were put to death in relation to the law through the [crucified] body of the Messiah, so that you may belong to another-- to Him who was raised from the dead-- that we may bear fruit for God.
45Rm 7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions operated through the law in every part of us and bore fruit for death.
45Rm 7:6 But now we have been released from the law, since we have died to what held us, so that we may serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old letter of the law.
45Rm 7:7 What should we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin if it were not for the law. For example, I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, You shall not covet.
45Rm 7:8 And sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind. For apart from the law sin is dead.
45Rm 7:9 Once I was alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life
45Rm 7:10 and I died. The commandment that was meant for life resulted in death for me.
45Rm 7:11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
45Rm 7:12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.
45Rm 7:13 Therefore, did what is good cause my death? Absolutely not! On the contrary, sin, in order to be recognized as sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.
45Rm 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am made out of flesh, sold into sin's power.
45Rm 7:15 For I do not understand what I am doing, because I do not practice what I want to do, but I do what I hate.
45Rm 7:16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good.
45Rm 7:17 So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me.
45Rm 7:18 For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it.
45Rm 7:19 For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do.
45Rm 7:20 Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me.
45Rm 7:21 So I discover this principle: when I want to do good, evil is with me.
45Rm 7:22 For in my inner self I joyfully agree with God's law.
45Rm 7:23 But I see a different law in the parts of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin in the parts of my body.
45Rm 7:24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
45Rm 7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself am a slave to the law of God, but with my flesh, to the law of sin.
45Rm 8:1 Therefore, no condemnation now exists for those in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 8:2 because the Spirit's law of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
45Rm 8:3 What the law could not do since it was limited by the flesh, God did. He condemned sin in the flesh by sending His own Son in flesh like ours under sin's domain, and as a sin offering,
45Rm 8:4 in order that the law's requirement would be accomplished in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45Rm 8:5 For those whose lives are according to the flesh think about the things of the flesh, but those whose lives are according to the Spirit, about the things of the Spirit.
45Rm 8:6 For the mind-set of the flesh is death, but the mind-set of the Spirit is life and peace.
45Rm 8:7 For the mind-set of the flesh is hostile to God because it does not submit itself to God's law, for it is unable to do so.
45Rm 8:8 Those whose lives are in the flesh are unable to please God.
45Rm 8:9 You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
45Rm 8:10 Now if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
45Rm 8:11 And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then He who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through His Spirit who lives in you.
45Rm 8:12 So then, brothers, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh,
45Rm 8:13 for if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
45Rm 8:14 All those led by God's Spirit are God's sons.
45Rm 8:15 For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father!"
45Rm 8:16 The Spirit Himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God's children,
45Rm 8:17 and if children, also heirs-- heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ-- seeing that we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.
45Rm 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is going to be revealed to us.
45Rm 8:19 For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation for God's sons to be revealed.
45Rm 8:20 For the creation was subjected to futility-- not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it-- in the hope
45Rm 8:21 that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of corruption into the glorious freedom of God's children.
45Rm 8:22 For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains until now.
45Rm 8:23 And not only that, but we ourselves who have the Spirit as the firstfruits-- we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
45Rm 8:24 Now in this hope we were saved, yet hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees?
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.
45Rm 8:26 In the same way the Spirit also joins to help in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with unspoken groanings.
45Rm 8:27 And He who searches the hearts knows the Spirit's mind-set, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
45Rm 8:28 We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God: those who are called according to His purpose.
45Rm 8:29 For those He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers.
45Rm 8:30 And those He predestined, He also called; and those He called, He also justified; and those He justified, He also glorified.
45Rm 8:31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
45Rm 8:32 He did not even spare His own Son, but offered Him up for us all; how will He not also with Him grant us everything?
45Rm 8:33 Who can bring an accusation against God's elect? God is the One who justifies.
45Rm 8:34 Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the One who died, but even more, has been raised; He also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us.
45Rm 8:35 Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
45Rm 8:36 As it is written: Because of You we are being put to death all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
45Rm 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than victorious through Him who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
45Rm 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will have the power to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord!
45Rm 9:1 I speak the truth in Christ-- I am not lying; my conscience is testifying to me with the Holy Spirit--
45Rm 9:2 that I have intense sorrow and continual anguish in my heart.
45Rm 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from the Messiah for the benefit of my brothers, my countrymen by physical descent.
45Rm 9:4 They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises.
45Rm 9:5 The forefathers are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Messiah, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
45Rm 9:6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
45Rm 9:7 Neither are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants. On the contrary, in Isaac your seed will be called.
45Rm 9:8 That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but the children of the promise are considered seed.
45Rm 9:9 For this is the statement of the promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.
45Rm 9:10 And not only that, but also when Rebekah became pregnant by Isaac our forefather
45Rm 9:11 (for though they had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to election might stand,
45Rm 9:12 not from works but from the One who calls) she was told: The older will serve the younger.
45Rm 9:13 As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.
45Rm 9:14 What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!
45Rm 9:15 For He tells Moses: I will show mercy to whom I show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
45Rm 9:16 So then it does not depend on human will or effort, but on God who shows mercy.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scripture tells Pharaoh: For this reason I raised you up: so that I may display My power in you, and that My name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
45Rm 9:18 So then, He shows mercy to whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.
45Rm 9:19 You will say to me, therefore, "Why then does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?"
45Rm 9:20 But who are you-- anyone who talks back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"
45Rm 9:21 Or has the potter no right over His clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor?
45Rm 9:22 And what if God, desiring to display His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath ready for destruction?
45Rm 9:23 And [what if] He did this to make known the riches of His glory on objects of mercy that He prepared beforehand for glory--
45Rm 9:24 on us whom He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
45Rm 9:25 As He also says in Hosea: I will call "Not-My-People," "My-People," and she who is "Unloved," "Beloved."
45Rm 9:26 And it will be in the place where they were told, you are not My people, there they will be called sons of the living God.
45Rm 9:27 But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: Though the number of Israel's sons is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved;
45Rm 9:28 for the Lord will execute His sentence completely and decisively on the earth.
45Rm 9:29 And just as Isaiah predicted: If the Lord of Hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.
45Rm 9:30 What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness-- namely the righteousness that comes from faith.
45Rm 9:31 But Israel, pursuing the law for righteousness, has not achieved the law.
45Rm 9:32 Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
45Rm 9:33 As it is written: Look! I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over, and a rock to trip over, yet the one who believes on Him will not be put to shame.
45Rm 10:1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God concerning them is for their salvation!
45Rm 10:2 I can testify about them that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
45Rm 10:3 Because they disregarded the righteousness from God and attempted to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to God's righteousness.
45Rm 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
45Rm 10:5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: The one who does these things will live by them.
45Rm 10:6 But the righteousness that comes from faith speaks like this: Do not say in your heart, "Who will go up to heaven?" that is, to bring Christ down
45Rm 10:7 or, "Who will go down into the abyss?" that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
45Rm 10:8 On the contrary, what does it say? The message is near you, in your mouth and in your heart. This is the message of faith that we proclaim:
45Rm 10:9 if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
45Rm 10:10 With the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses, resulting in salvation.
45Rm 10:11 Now the Scripture says, No one who believes on Him will be put to shame,
45Rm 10:12 for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, since the same Lord of all is rich to all who call on Him.
45Rm 10:13 For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
45Rm 10:14 But how can they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe without hearing about Him? And how can they hear without a preacher?
45Rm 10:15 And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How welcome are the feet of those who announce the gospel of good things!
45Rm 10:16 But all did not obey the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our message?
45Rm 10:17 So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the message about Christ.
45Rm 10:18 But I ask, "Did they not hear?" Yes, they did: Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the inhabited world.
45Rm 10:19 But I ask, "Did Israel not understand?" First, Moses said: I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that lacks understanding.
45Rm 10:20 And Isaiah says boldly: I was found by those who were not looking for Me; I revealed Myself to those who were not asking for Me.
45Rm 10:21 But to Israel he says: All day long I have spread out My hands to a disobedient and defiant people.
45Rm 11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected His people? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the Elijah section-- how he pleads with God against Israel?
45Rm 11:3 Lord, they have killed Your prophets, torn down Your altars; and I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life!
45Rm 11:4 But what was God's reply to him? I have left 7,000 men for Myself who have not bowed down to Baal.
45Rm 11:5 In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace.
45Rm 11:6 Now if by grace, then it is not by works; otherwise grace ceases to be grace.
45Rm 11:7 What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for, but the elect did find it. The rest were hardened,
45Rm 11:8 as it is written: God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that cannot see and ears that cannot hear, to this day.
45Rm 11:9 And David says: Let their feasting become a snare and a trap, a pitfall and a retribution to them.
45Rm 11:10 Let their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent continually.
45Rm 11:11 I ask, then, have they stumbled so as to fall? Absolutely not! On the contrary, by their stumbling, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.
45Rm 11:12 Now if their stumbling brings riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full number bring!
45Rm 11:13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. In view of the fact that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
45Rm 11:14 if I can somehow make my own people jealous and save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For if their being rejected is world reconciliation, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
45Rm 11:16 Now if the firstfruits offered up are holy, so is the whole batch. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45Rm 11:17 Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, though a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them, and have come to share in the rich root of the cultivated olive tree,
45Rm 11:18 do not brag that you are better than those branches. But if you do brag-- you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you.
45Rm 11:19 Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
45Rm 11:20 True enough; they were broken off by unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.
45Rm 11:21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either.
45Rm 11:22 Therefore, consider God's kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you-- if you remain in His kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God has the power to graft them in again.
45Rm 11:24 For if you were cut off from your native wild olive, and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these-- the natural branches-- be grafted into their own olive tree?
45Rm 11:25 So that you will not be conceited, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery: a partial hardening has come to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
45Rm 11:26 And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Liberator will come from Zion; He will turn away godlessness from Jacob.
45Rm 11:27 And this will be My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.
45Rm 11:28 Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage, but regarding election, they are loved because of their forefathers,
45Rm 11:29 since God's gracious gifts and calling are irrevocable.
45Rm 11:30 As you once disobeyed God, but now have received mercy through their disobedience,
45Rm 11:31 so they too have now disobeyed, [resulting] in mercy to you, so that they also now may receive mercy.
45Rm 11:32 For God has imprisoned all in disobedience, so that He may have mercy on all.
45Rm 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments and untraceable His ways!
45Rm 11:34 For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?
45Rm 11:35 Or who has ever first given to Him, and has to be repaid?
45Rm 11:36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
45Rm 12:1 Therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your spiritual worship.
45Rm 12:2 Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.
45Rm 12:3 For by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one.
45Rm 12:4 Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function,
45Rm 12:5 in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another.
45Rm 12:6 According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts: If prophecy, use it according to the standard of faith;
45Rm 12:7 if service, in service; if teaching, in teaching;
45Rm 12:8 if exhorting, in exhortation; giving, with generosity; leading, with diligence; showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
45Rm 12:9 Love must be without hypocrisy. Detest evil; cling to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Show family affection to one another with brotherly love. Outdo one another in showing honor.
45Rm 12:11 Do not lack diligence; be fervent in spirit; serve the Lord.
45Rm 12:12 Rejoice in hope; be patient in affliction; be persistent in prayer.
45Rm 12:13 Share with the saints in their needs; pursue hospitality.
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
45Rm 12:15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
45Rm 12:16 Be in agreement with one another. Do not be proud; instead, associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
45Rm 12:17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Try to do what is honorable in everyone's eyes.
45Rm 12:18 If possible, on your part, live at peace with everyone.
45Rm 12:19 Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for His wrath. For it is written: Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay, says the Lord.
45Rm 12:20 But If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him something to drink. For in so doing you will be heaping fiery coals on his head.
45Rm 12:21 Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
45Rm 13:1 Everyone must submit to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are instituted by God.
45Rm 13:2 So then, the one who resists the authority is opposing God's command, and those who oppose it will bring judgment on themselves.
45Rm 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do good and you will have its approval.
45Rm 13:4 For government is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For government is God's servant, an avenger that brings wrath on the one who does wrong.
45Rm 13:5 Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath, but also because of your conscience.
45Rm 13:6 And for this reason you pay taxes, since the [authorities] are God's public servants, continually attending to these tasks.
45Rm 13:7 Pay your obligations to everyone: taxes to those you owe taxes, tolls to those you owe tolls, respect to those you owe respect, and honor to those you owe honor.
45Rm 13:8 Do not owe anyone anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
45Rm 13:9 The commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and if there is any other commandment-- all are summed up by this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
45Rm 13:10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.
45Rm 13:11 Besides this, knowing the time, it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
45Rm 13:12 The night is nearly over, and the daylight is near, so let us discard the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45Rm 13:13 Let us walk with decency, as in the daylight: not in carousing and drunkenness; not in sexual impurity and promiscuity; not in quarreling and jealousy.
45Rm 13:14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no plans to satisfy the fleshly desires.
45Rm 14:1 Accept anyone who is weak in faith, but don't argue about doubtful issues.
45Rm 14:2 One person believes he may eat anything, but one who is weak eats only vegetables.
45Rm 14:3 One who eats must not look down on one who does not eat; and one who does not eat must not criticize one who does, because God has accepted him.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to criticize another's household slave? Before his own Lord he stands or falls. And stand he will! For the Lord is able to make him stand.
45Rm 14:5 One person considers one day to be above another day. Someone else considers every day to be the same. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.
45Rm 14:6 Whoever observes the day, observes it to the Lord. Whoever eats, eats to the Lord, since he gives thanks to God; and whoever does not eat, it is to the Lord that he does not eat, yet he thanks God.
45Rm 14:7 For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.
45Rm 14:8 If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45Rm 14:9 Christ died and came to life for this: that He might rule over both the dead and the living.
45Rm 14:10 But you, why do you criticize your brother? Or you, why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
45Rm 14:11 For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to Me, and every tongue will give praise to God.
45Rm 14:12 So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
45Rm 14:13 Therefore, let us no longer criticize one another, but instead decide not to put a stumbling block or pitfall in your brother's way.
45Rm 14:14 (I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. Still, to someone who considers a thing to be unclean, to that one it is unclean.)
45Rm 14:15 For if your brother is hurt by what you eat, you are no longer walking according to love. By what you eat, do not destroy that one for whom Christ died.
45Rm 14:16 Therefore, do not let your good be slandered,
45Rm 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 14:18 Whoever serves the Messiah in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.
45Rm 14:19 So then, we must pursue what promotes peace and what builds up one another.
45Rm 14:20 Do not tear down God's work because of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong for a man to cause stumbling by what he eats.
45Rm 14:21 It is a noble thing not to eat meat, or drink wine, or do anything that makes your brother stumble.
45Rm 14:22 Do you have faith? Keep it to yourself before God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
45Rm 14:23 But whoever doubts stands condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith, and everything that is not from faith is sin.
45Rm 15:1 Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not to please ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 Each one of us must please his neighbor for his good, in order to build him up.
45Rm 15:3 For even the Messiah did not please Himself. On the contrary, as it is written, The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.
45Rm 15:4 For whatever was written before was written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope.
45Rm 15:5 Now may the God of endurance and encouragement grant you agreement with one another, according to Christ Jesus,
45Rm 15:6 so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with a united mind and voice.
45Rm 15:7 Therefore accept one another, just as the Messiah also accepted you, to the glory of God.
45Rm 15:8 Now I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God, to confirm the promises to the fathers,
45Rm 15:9 and so that Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles, and I will sing psalms to Your name.
45Rm 15:10 Again it says: Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people!
45Rm 15:11 And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; all the peoples should praise Him!
45Rm 15:12 And again, Isaiah says: The root of Jesse will appear, the One who rises to rule the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles will hope.
45Rm 15:13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:14 Now, my brothers, I myself am convinced about you that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.
45Rm 15:15 Nevertheless, to remind you, I have written to you more boldly on some points because of the grace given me by God
45Rm 15:16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of God's good news. My purpose is that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 Therefore I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus regarding what pertains to God.
45Rm 15:18 For I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed,
45Rm 15:19 by the power of miraculous signs and wonders, and by the power of God's Spirit. As a result, I have fully proclaimed the good news about the Messiah from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum.
45Rm 15:20 So my aim is to evangelize where Christ has not been named, in order that I will not be building on someone else's foundation,
45Rm 15:21 but, as it is written: Those who had no report of Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.
45Rm 15:22 That is why I have been prevented many times from coming to you.
45Rm 15:23 But now I no longer have any work to do in these provinces, and I have strongly desired for many years to come to you
45Rm 15:24 whenever I travel to Spain. For I do hope to see you when I pass through, and to be sent on my way there by you, once I have first enjoyed your company for a while.
45Rm 15:25 Now, however, I am traveling to Jerusalem to serve the saints;
45Rm 15:26 for Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution to the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:27 Yes, they were pleased, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual benefits, then they are obligated to minister to Jews in material needs.
45Rm 15:28 So when I have finished this and safely delivered the funds to them, I will go by way of you to Spain.
45Rm 15:29 But I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
45Rm 15:30 Now I implore you, brothers, through the Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to agonize together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf:
45Rm 15:31 that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
45Rm 15:32 and that, by God's will, I may come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you.
45Rm 15:33 The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.
45Rm 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae.
45Rm 16:2 So you should welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever matter she may require your help. For indeed she has been a benefactor of many-- and of me also.
45Rm 16:3 Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 16:4 who risked their own necks for my life. Not only do I thank them, but so do all the Gentile churches.
45Rm 16:5 Greet also the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia.
45Rm 16:6 Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow countrymen and fellow prisoners. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were also in Christ before me.
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet Herodion, my fellow countryman. Greet those who belong to the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
45Rm 16:12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord; also his mother-- and mine.
45Rm 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
45Rm 16:15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send you greetings.
45Rm 16:17 Now I implore you, brothers, watch out for those who cause dissensions and pitfalls contrary to the doctrine you have learned. Avoid them;
45Rm 16:18 for such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
45Rm 16:19 The report of your obedience has reached everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise about what is good, yet innocent about what is evil.
45Rm 16:20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my co-worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow countrymen, greet you.
45Rm 16:22 I Tertius, who penned this epistle in the Lord, greet you.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you.
45Rm 16:24 [[The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.]]
45Rm 16:25 Now to Him who has power to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret kept silent for long ages,
45Rm 16:26 but now revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God, to advance the obedience of faith among all nations--
45Rm 16:27 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ-- to Him be the glory forever! Amen.
46
461Co 1:1 Paul, called as an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and our brother Sosthenes:
461Co 1:2 To God's church at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus and called as saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord-- theirs and ours.
461Co 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:4 I always thank my God for you because of God's grace given to you in Christ Jesus,
461Co 1:5 that by Him you were made rich in everything-- in all speaking and all knowledge--
461Co 1:6 as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
461Co 1:7 so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:8 He will also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:9 God is faithful; by Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
461Co 1:10 Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing, that there be no divisions among you, and that you be united with the same understanding and the same conviction.
461Co 1:11 For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers, by members of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.
461Co 1:12 What I am saying is this: each of you says, "I'm with Paul," or "I'm with Apollos," or "I'm with Cephas," or "I'm with Christ."
461Co 1:13 Is Christ divided? Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul's name?
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 so that no one can say you had been baptized in my name.
461Co 1:16 I did, in fact, baptize the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't know if I baptized anyone else.
461Co 1:17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel-- not with clever words, so that the cross of Christ will not be emptied [of its effect].
461Co 1:18 For to those who are perishing the message of the cross is foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is God's power.
461Co 1:19 For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the experts.
461Co 1:20 Where is the philosopher? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn't God made the world's wisdom foolish?
461Co 1:21 For since, in God's wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of the message preached.
461Co 1:22 For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks seek wisdom,
461Co 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.
461Co 1:24 Yet to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power and God's wisdom,
461Co 1:25 because God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.
461Co 1:26 Brothers, consider your calling: not many are wise from a human perspective, not many powerful, not many of noble birth.
461Co 1:27 Instead, God has chosen the world's foolish things to shame the wise, and God has chosen the world's weak things to shame the strong.
461Co 1:28 God has chosen the world's insignificant and despised things-- the things viewed as nothing-- so He might bring to nothing the things that are viewed as something,
461Co 1:29 so that no one can boast in His presence.
461Co 1:30 But from Him you are in Christ Jesus, who for us became wisdom from God, as well as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,
461Co 1:31 in order that, as it is written: The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.
461Co 2:1 When I came to you, brothers, announcing the testimony of God to you, I did not come with brilliance of speech or wisdom.
461Co 2:2 For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
461Co 2:3 And I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
461Co 2:4 My speech and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,
461Co 2:5 so that your faith might not be based on men's wisdom but on God's power.
461Co 2:6 However, among the mature we do speak a wisdom, but not a wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
461Co 2:7 On the contrary, we speak God's hidden wisdom in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.
461Co 2:8 None of the rulers of this age knew it, for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
461Co 2:9 But as it is written: What no eye has seen and no ear has heard, and what has never come into a man's heart, is what God has prepared for those who love Him.
461Co 2:10 Now God has revealed them to us by the Spirit, for the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.
461Co 2:11 For who among men knows the concerns of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? In the same way, no one knows the concerns of God except the Spirit of God.
461Co 2:12 Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order to know what has been freely given to us by God.
461Co 2:13 We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.
461Co 2:14 But the natural man does not welcome what comes from God's Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to know it since it is evaluated spiritually.
461Co 2:15 The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone.
461Co 2:16 For: who has known the Lord's mind, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
461Co 3:1 Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.
461Co 3:2 I fed you milk, not solid food, because you were not yet able to receive it. In fact, you are still not able,
461Co 3:3 because you are still fleshly. For since there is envy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living like ordinary people?
461Co 3:4 For whenever someone says, "I'm with Paul," and another, "I'm with Apollos," are you not [typical] men?
461Co 3:5 So, what is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.
461Co 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
461Co 3:7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
461Co 3:8 Now the one who plants and the one who waters are equal, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
461Co 3:9 For we are God's co-workers. You are God's field, God's building.
461Co 3:10 According to God's grace that was given to me, as a skilled master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it,
461Co 3:11 because no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid-- that is, Jesus Christ.
461Co 3:12 If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
461Co 3:13 each one's work will become obvious, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one's work.
461Co 3:14 If anyone's work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward.
461Co 3:15 If anyone's work is burned up, it will be lost, but he will be saved; yet it will be like an escape through fire.
461Co 3:16 Don't you know that you are God's sanctuary and that the Spirit of God lives in you?
461Co 3:17 If anyone ruins God's sanctuary, God will ruin him; for God's sanctuary is holy, and that is what you are.
461Co 3:18 No one should deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become foolish so that he can become wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness--
461Co 3:20 and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.
461Co 3:21 So no one should boast in men, for all things are yours:
461Co 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come-- all are yours,
461Co 3:23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ to God.
461Co 4:1 A person should consider us in this way: as servants of Christ and managers of God's mysteries.
461Co 4:2 In this regard, it is expected of managers that each one be found faithful.
461Co 4:3 It is of little importance that I should be evaluated by you or by a human court. In fact, I don't even evaluate myself.
461Co 4:4 For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this. The One who evaluates me is the Lord.
461Co 4:5 Therefore don't judge anything prematurely, before the Lord comes, who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God.
461Co 4:6 Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the saying: "Nothing beyond what is written." The purpose is that none of you will be inflated with pride in favor of one person over another.
461Co 4:7 For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you didn't receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn't received it?
461Co 4:8 Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have begun to reign as kings without us-- and I wish you did reign, so that we also could reign with you!
461Co 4:9 For I think God has displayed us, the apostles, in last place, like men condemned to die: we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.
461Co 4:10 We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!
461Co 4:11 Up to the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, homeless;
461Co 4:12 we labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
461Co 4:13 when we are slandered, we entreat. We are, even now, like the world's garbage, like the filth of all things.
461Co 4:14 I'm not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.
461Co 4:15 For you can have 10,000 instructors in Christ, but you can't have many fathers. Now I have fathered you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
461Co 4:16 Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.
461Co 4:17 This is why I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you about my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
461Co 4:18 Now some are inflated with pride, as though I were not coming to you.
461Co 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk but the power of those who are inflated with pride.
461Co 4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in talk but in power.
461Co 4:21 What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
461Co 5:1 It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and the kind of sexual immorality that is not even condoned among the Gentiles-- a man is living with his father's wife.
461Co 5:2 And you are inflated with pride, instead of filled with grief so that he who has committed this act might be removed from among you.
461Co 5:3 For though absent in body but present in spirit, I have already decided about him who has done this thing as though I were present.
461Co 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, along with my spirit and with the power of our Lord Jesus,
461Co 5:5 turn that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord.
461Co 5:6 Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast permeates the whole batch of dough?
461Co 5:7 Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch, since you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
461Co 5:8 Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old yeast, or with the yeast of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
461Co 5:9 I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--
461Co 5:10 by no means referring to this world's immoral people, or to the greedy and swindlers, or to idolaters; otherwise you would have to leave the world.
461Co 5:11 But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother who is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a reviler, a drunkard or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.
461Co 5:12 For what is it to me to judge outsiders? Do you not judge those who are inside?
461Co 5:13 But God judges outsiders. Put away the evil person from among yourselves.
461Co 6:1 Does any of you who has a complaint against someone dare go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
461Co 6:2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest cases?
461Co 6:3 Do you not know that we will judge angels-- not to speak of things pertaining to this life?
461Co 6:4 So if you have cases pertaining to this life, do you select those who have no standing in the church to judge?
461Co 6:5 I say this to your shame! Can it be that there is not one wise person among you who will be able to arbitrate between his brothers?
461Co 6:6 Instead, brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!
461Co 6:7 Therefore, it is already a total defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather put up with injustice? Why not rather be cheated?
461Co 6:8 Instead, you act unjustly and cheat-- and this to brothers!
461Co 6:9 Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit God's kingdom? Do not be deceived: no sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,
461Co 6:10 thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers, or swindlers will inherit God's kingdom.
461Co 6:11 Some of you were like this; but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
461Co 6:12 "Everything is permissible for me," but not everything is helpful. "Everything is permissible for me," but I will not be brought under the control of anything.
461Co 6:13 "Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods," but God will do away with both of them. The body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
461Co 6:14 God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.
461Co 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? So should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!
461Co 6:16 Do you not know that anyone joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, The two will become one flesh.
461Co 6:17 But anyone joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
461Co 6:18 Flee from sexual immorality! "Every sin a person can commit is outside the body," but the person who is sexually immoral sins against his own body.
461Co 6:19 Do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,
461Co 6:20 for you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body.
461Co 7:1 About the things you wrote: "It is good for a man not to have relations with a woman."
461Co 7:2 But because of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
461Co 7:3 A husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.
461Co 7:4 A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. Equally, a husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does.
461Co 7:5 Do not deprive one another-- except when you agree, for a time, to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again; otherwise, Satan may tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.
461Co 7:7 I wish that all people were just like me. But each has his own gift from God, one this and another that.
461Co 7:8 I say to the unmarried and to widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.
461Co 7:9 But if they do not have self-control, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with desire.
461Co 7:10 I command the married-- not I, but the Lord-- a wife is not to leave her husband.
461Co 7:11 But if she does leave, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband-- and a husband is not to leave his wife.
461Co 7:12 But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, he must not leave her.
461Co 7:13 Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to live with her, she must not leave her husband.
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the Christian husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
461Co 7:15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you to peace.
461Co 7:16 For you, wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Or you, husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?
461Co 7:17 However, each one must live his life in the situation the Lord assigned when God called him. This is what I command in all the churches.
461Co 7:18 Was anyone already circumcised when he was called? He should not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised.
461Co 7:19 Circumcision does not matter and uncircumcision does not matter, but keeping God's commandments does.
461Co 7:20 Each person should remain in the life situation in which he was called.
461Co 7:21 Were you called while a slave? It should not be a concern to you. But if you can become free, by all means take the opportunity.
461Co 7:22 For he who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman. Likewise he who is called as a free man is Christ's slave.
461Co 7:23 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.
461Co 7:24 Brothers, each person should remain with God in whatever situation he was called.
461Co 7:25 About virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I do give an opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
461Co 7:26 Therefore I consider this to be good because of the present distress: it is fine for a man to stay as he is.
461Co 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
461Co 7:28 However, if you do get married, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.
461Co 7:29 And I say this, brothers: the time is limited, so from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none,
461Co 7:30 those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,
461Co 7:31 and those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away.
461Co 7:32 I want you to be without concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord-- how he may please the Lord.
461Co 7:33 But a married man is concerned about the things of the world-- how he may please his wife--
461Co 7:34 and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world-- how she may please her husband.
461Co 7:35 Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but because of what is proper, and so that you may be devoted to the Lord without distraction.
461Co 7:36 But if any man thinks he is acting improperly toward his virgin, if she is past marriageable age, and so it must be, he can do what he wants. He is not sinning; they can get married.
461Co 7:37 But he who stands firm in his heart (who is under no compulsion, but has control over his own will) and has decided in his heart to keep his own virgin, will do well.
461Co 7:38 So then he who marries his virgin does well, but he who does not marry will do better.
461Co 7:39 A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to anyone she wants-- only in the Lord.
461Co 7:40 But she is happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
461Co 8:1 About food offered to idols: We know that "we all have knowledge." Knowledge inflates with pride, but love builds up.
461Co 8:2 If anyone thinks he knows anything, he does not yet know it as he ought to know it.
461Co 8:3 But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
461Co 8:4 About eating food offered to idols, then, we know that "an idol is nothing in the world," and that "there is no God but one."
461Co 8:5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth-- as there are many "gods" and many "lords"--
461Co 8:6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.
461Co 8:7 However, not everyone has this knowledge. In fact, some have been so used to idolatry up until now, that when they eat food offered to an idol, their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
461Co 8:8 Food will not make us acceptable to God. We are not inferior if we don't eat, and we are not better if we do eat.
461Co 8:9 But be careful that this right of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block to the weak.
461Co 8:10 For if somebody sees you, the one who has this knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, won't his weak conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?
461Co 8:11 Then the weak person, the brother for whom Christ died, is ruined by your knowledge.
461Co 8:12 Now when you sin like this against the brothers and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.
461Co 8:13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never again eat meat, so that I won't cause my brother to fall.
461Co 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
461Co 9:2 If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
461Co 9:3 My defense to those who examine me is this:
461Co 9:4 Don't we have the right to eat and drink?
461Co 9:5 Don't we have the right to be accompanied by a Christian wife, like the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas?
461Co 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working?
461Co 9:7 Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock?
461Co 9:8 Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn't the law also say the same thing?
461Co 9:9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain. Is God really concerned with oxen?
461Co 9:10 Or isn't He really saying it for us? Yes, this is written for us, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes should do so in hope of sharing the crop.
461Co 9:11 If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
461Co 9:12 If others share this authority over you, don't we even more? However, we have not used this authority; instead we endure everything so that we will not hinder the gospel of Christ.
461Co 9:13 Do you not know that those who perform the temple services eat the food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings of the altar?
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
461Co 9:15 But I have used none of these rights, and I have not written this to make it happen that way for me. For it would be better for me to die than for anyone to deprive me of my boast!
461Co 9:16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because an obligation is placed on me. And woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
461Co 9:17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
461Co 9:18 What then is my reward? To preach the gospel and offer it free of charge, and not make full use of my authority in the gospel.
461Co 9:19 For although I am free from all people, I have made myself a slave to all, in order to win more people.
461Co 9:20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews; to those under the law, like one under the law-- though I myself am not under the law-- to win those under the law.
461Co 9:21 To those who are outside the law, like one outside the law-- not being outside God's law, but under the law of Christ-- to win those outside the law.
461Co 9:22 To the weak I became weak, in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some.
461Co 9:23 Now I do all this because of the gospel, that I may become a partner in its benefits.
461Co 9:24 Do you not know that the runners in a stadium all race, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
461Co 9:25 Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything. However, they do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
461Co 9:26 Therefore I do not run like one who runs aimlessly, or box like one who beats the air.
461Co 9:27 Instead, I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
461Co 10:1 Now I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea,
461Co 10:2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
461Co 10:3 They all ate the same spiritual food,
461Co 10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
461Co 10:5 But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the desert.
461Co 10:6 Now these things became examples for us, so that we will not desire evil as they did.
461Co 10:7 Don't become idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play.
461Co 10:8 Let us not commit sexual immorality as some of them did, and in a single day 23,000 people fell dead.
461Co 10:9 Let us not tempt Christ as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes.
461Co 10:10 Nor should we complain as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer.
461Co 10:11 Now these things happened to them as examples, and they were written as a warning to us, on whom the ends of the ages have come.
461Co 10:12 Therefore, whoever thinks he stands must be careful not to fall!
461Co 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity. God is faithful and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape, so that you are able to bear it.
461Co 10:14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
461Co 10:15 I am speaking as to wise people. Judge for yourselves what I say.
461Co 10:16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
461Co 10:17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for all of us share that one bread.
461Co 10:18 Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?
461Co 10:19 What am I saying then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
461Co 10:20 No, but I do say that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons!
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the Lord's table and the table of demons.
461Co 10:22 Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
461Co 10:23 "Everything is permissible," but not everything is helpful. "Everything is permissible," but not everything builds up.
461Co 10:24 No one should seek his own [good], but [the good] of the other person.
461Co 10:25 Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience' sake, for
461Co 10:26 the earth is the Lord's, and all that is in it.
461Co 10:27 If one of the unbelievers invites you over and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, without raising questions of conscience.
461Co 10:28 But if someone says to you, "This is food offered to an idol," do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who told you, and for conscience' sake.
461Co 10:29 I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person's. For why is my freedom judged by another person's conscience?
461Co 10:30 If I partake with thanks, why am I slandered because of something for which I give thanks?
461Co 10:31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for God's glory.
461Co 10:32 Give no offense to the Jews or the Greeks or the church of God,
461Co 10:33 just as I also try to please all people in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
461Co 11:1 Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.
461Co 11:2 Now I praise you because you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you.
461Co 11:3 But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.
461Co 11:4 Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head.
461Co 11:5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since that is one and the same as having her head shaved.
461Co 11:6 So if a woman's head is not covered, her hair should be cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should be covered.
461Co 11:7 A man, in fact, should not cover his head, because he is God's image and glory, but woman is man's glory.
461Co 11:8 For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man;
461Co 11:9 and man was not created for woman, but woman for man.
461Co 11:10 This is why a woman should have [a symbol of] authority on her head: because of the angels.
461Co 11:11 However, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, and man is not independent of woman.
461Co 11:12 For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman, and all things come from God.
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
461Co 11:14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him,
461Co 11:15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
461Co 11:16 But if anyone wants to argue about this, we have no other custom, nor do the churches of God.
461Co 11:17 Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.
461Co 11:18 For, to begin with, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
461Co 11:19 There must, indeed, be factions among you, so that the approved among you may be recognized.
461Co 11:20 Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not really to eat the Lord's Supper.
461Co 11:21 For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others, and one person is hungry while another is drunk!
461Co 11:22 Don't you have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you look down on the church of God and embarrass those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you for this!
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: on the night when He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread,
461Co 11:24 gave thanks, broke it, and said, "This is My body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of Me."
461Co 11:25 In the same way [He] also [took] the cup, after supper, and said, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."
461Co 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.
461Co 11:27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way will be guilty of sin against the body and blood of the Lord.
461Co 11:28 So a man should examine himself; in this way he should eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
461Co 11:29 For whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.
461Co 11:30 This is why many are sick and ill among you, and many have fallen asleep.
461Co 11:31 If we were properly evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged,
461Co 11:32 but when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we may not be condemned with the world.
461Co 11:33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
461Co 11:34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that you can come together and not cause judgment. And I will give instructions about the other matters whenever I come.
461Co 12:1 About matters of the spirit: brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
461Co 12:2 You know how, when you were pagans, you were led to dumb idols-- being led astray.
461Co 12:3 Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
461Co 12:4 Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit.
461Co 12:5 There are different ministries, but the same Lord.
461Co 12:6 And there are different activities, but the same God is active in everyone and everything.
461Co 12:7 A manifestation of the Spirit is given to each person to produce what is beneficial:
461Co 12:8 to one is given a message of wisdom through the Spirit, to another, a message of knowledge by the same Spirit,
461Co 12:9 to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
461Co 12:10 to another, the performing of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, distinguishing between spirits, to another, different kinds of languages, to another, interpretation of languages.
461Co 12:11 But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each one as He wills.
461Co 12:12 For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of that body, though many, are one body-- so also is Christ.
461Co 12:13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body-- whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free-- and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
461Co 12:14 So the body is not one part but many.
461Co 12:15 If the foot should say, "Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body," in spite of this it still belongs to the body.
461Co 12:16 And if the ear should say, "Because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body," in spite of this it still belongs to the body.
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
461Co 12:18 But now God has placed the parts, each one of them, in the body just as He wanted.
461Co 12:19 And if they were all the same part, where would the body be?
461Co 12:20 Now there are many parts, yet one body.
461Co 12:21 So the eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" nor again the head to the feet, "I don't need you!"
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, all the more, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary.
461Co 12:23 And those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe these with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts have a better presentation.
461Co 12:24 But our presentable parts have no need [of clothing]. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable,
461Co 12:25 so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other.
461Co 12:26 So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
461Co 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ, and individual members of it.
461Co 12:28 And God has placed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, next, miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, managing, various kinds of languages.
461Co 12:29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?
461Co 12:30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in languages? Do all interpret?
461Co 12:31 But desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even better way.
461Co 13:1 If I speak the languages of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
461Co 13:2 If I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so that I can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
461Co 13:3 And if I donate all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
461Co 13:4 Love is patient; love is kind. Love does not envy; is not boastful; is not conceited;
461Co 13:5 does not act improperly; is not selfish; is not provoked; does not keep a record of wrongs;
461Co 13:6 finds no joy in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth;
461Co 13:7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
461Co 13:8 Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for languages, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.
461Co 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
461Co 13:10 But when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things.
461Co 13:12 For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known.
461Co 13:13 Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, and above all that you may prophesy.
461Co 14:2 For the person who speaks in [another] language is not speaking to men but to God, since no one understands him; however, he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.
461Co 14:3 But the person who prophesies speaks to people for edification, encouragement, and consolation.
461Co 14:4 The person who speaks in [another] language builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.
461Co 14:5 I wish all of you spoke in other languages, but even more that you prophesied. The person who prophesies is greater than the person who speaks in languages, unless he interprets so that the church may be built up.
461Co 14:6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in [other] languages, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you with a revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
461Co 14:7 Even inanimate things producing sounds-- whether flute or harp-- if they don't make a distinction in the notes, how will what is played on the flute or harp be recognized?
461Co 14:8 In fact, if the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?
461Co 14:9 In the same way, unless you use your tongue for intelligible speech, how will what is spoken be known? For you will be speaking into the air.
461Co 14:10 There are doubtless many different kinds of languages in the world, and all have meaning.
461Co 14:11 Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.
461Co 14:12 So also you-- since you are zealous in matters of the spirit, seek to excel in building up the church.
461Co 14:13 Therefore the person who speaks in [another] language should pray that he can interpret.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in [another] language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
461Co 14:15 What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with my understanding.
461Co 14:16 Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will the uninformed person say "Amen" at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
461Co 14:17 For you may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not being built up.
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in [other] languages more than all of you;
461Co 14:19 yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order to teach others also, than 10,000 words in [another] language.
461Co 14:20 Brothers, don't be childish in your thinking, but be infants in evil and adult in your thinking.
461Co 14:21 It is written in the law: By people of other languages and by the lips of foreigners, I will speak to this people; and even then, they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.
461Co 14:22 It follows that speaking in other languages is intended as a sign, not to believers but to unbelievers. But prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.
461Co 14:23 Therefore if the whole church assembles together, and all are speaking in [other] languages, and people who are uninformed or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
461Co 14:24 But if all are prophesying, and some unbeliever or uninformed person comes in, he is convicted by all and is judged by all.
461Co 14:25 The secrets of his heart will be revealed, and as a result he will fall down on his face and worship God, proclaiming, "God is really among you."
461Co 14:26 How is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, [another] language, or an interpretation. All things must be done for edification.
461Co 14:27 If any person speaks in [another] language, there should be only two, or at the most three, each in turn, and someone must interpret.
461Co 14:28 But if there is no interpreter, that person should keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.
461Co 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should evaluate.
461Co 14:30 But if something has been revealed to another person sitting there, the first prophet should be silent.
461Co 14:31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.
461Co 14:32 And the prophets' spirits are under the control of the prophets,
461Co 14:33 since God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
461Co 14:34 the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as the law also says.
461Co 14:35 And if they want to learn something, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church meeting.
461Co 14:36 Did the word of God originate from you, or did it come to you only?
461Co 14:37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that what I write to you is the Lord's command.
461Co 14:38 But if anyone ignores this, he will be ignored.
461Co 14:39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in [other] languages.
461Co 14:40 But everything must be done decently and in order.
461Co 15:1 Now brothers, I want to clarify for you the gospel I proclaimed to you; you received it and have taken your stand on it.
461Co 15:2 You are also saved by it, if you hold to the message I proclaimed to you-- unless you believed to no purpose.
461Co 15:3 For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:4 that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.
461Co 15:6 Then He appeared to over 500 brothers at one time, most of whom remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:7 Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
461Co 15:8 Last of all, as to one abnormally born, He also appeared to me.
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
461Co 15:10 But by God's grace I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not ineffective. However, I worked more than any of them, yet not I, but God's grace that was with me.
461Co 15:11 Therefore, whether it is I or they, so we preach and so you have believed.
461Co 15:12 Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say, "There is no resurrection of the dead"?
461Co 15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;
461Co 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is without foundation, and so is your faith.
461Co 15:15 In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified about God that He raised up Christ-- whom He did not raise up if in fact the dead are not raised.
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised.
461Co 15:17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.
461Co 15:18 Therefore those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished.
461Co 15:19 If we have placed our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone.
461Co 15:20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.
461Co 15:22 For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
461Co 15:23 But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward, at His coming, the people of Christ.
461Co 15:24 Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when He abolishes all rule and all authority and power.
461Co 15:25 For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.
461Co 15:26 The last enemy to be abolished is death.
461Co 15:27 For He has put everything under His feet. But when it says "everything" is put under Him, it is obvious that He who puts everything under Him is the exception.
461Co 15:28 And when everything is subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who subjected everything to Him, so that God may be all in all.
461Co 15:29 Otherwise what will they do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are people baptized for them?
461Co 15:30 Why are we in danger every hour?
461Co 15:31 I affirm by the pride in you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord: I die every day!
461Co 15:32 If I fought wild animals in Ephesus with only human hope, what good does that do me? If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
461Co 15:33 Do not be deceived: "Bad company corrupts good morals."
461Co 15:34 Become right-minded and stop sinning, because some people are ignorant about God. I say this to your shame.
461Co 15:35 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come?"
461Co 15:36 Foolish one! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
461Co 15:37 And as for what you sow-- you are not sowing the future body, but only a seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain.
461Co 15:38 But God gives it a body as He wants, and to each of the seeds its own body.
461Co 15:39 Not all flesh is the same flesh; there is one flesh for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
461Co 15:40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is different from that of the earthly ones.
461Co 15:41 There is a splendor of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in splendor.
461Co 15:42 So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption;
461Co 15:43 sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;
461Co 15:44 sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
461Co 15:45 So it is written: The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
461Co 15:46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.
461Co 15:47 The first man was from the earth and made of dust; the second man is from heaven.
461Co 15:48 Like the man made of dust, so are those who are made of dust; like the heavenly man, so are those who are heavenly.
461Co 15:49 And just as we have borne the image of the man made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly man.
461Co 15:50 Brothers, I tell you this: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and corruption cannot inherit incorruption.
461Co 15:51 Listen! I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
461Co 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
461Co 15:53 Because this corruptible must be clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality.
461Co 15:54 Now when this corruptible is clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: Death has been swallowed up in victory.
461Co 15:55 O Death, where is your victory? O Death, where is your sting?
461Co 15:56 Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
461Co 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
461Co 15:58 Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord's work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
461Co 16:1 Now about the collection for the saints: you should do the same as I instructed the Galatian churches.
461Co 16:2 On the first day of the week, each of you is to set something aside and save to the extent that he prospers, so that no collections will need to be made when I come.
461Co 16:3 And when I arrive, I will send those whom you recommend by letter to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
461Co 16:4 If it is also suitable for me to go, they will travel with me.
461Co 16:5 I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia-- for I will be traveling through Macedonia--
461Co 16:6 and perhaps I will remain with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me on my way wherever I go.
461Co 16:7 I don't want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows.
461Co 16:8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
461Co 16:9 because a wide door for effective ministry has opened for me-- yet many oppose me.
461Co 16:10 If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear from you, because he is doing the Lord's work, just as I am.
461Co 16:11 Therefore no one should look down on him; but you should send him on his way in peace so he can come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
461Co 16:12 About our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but he was not at all willing to come now. However, when he has time, he will come.
461Co 16:13 Be alert, stand firm in the faith, be brave and strong.
461Co 16:14 Your every [action] must be done with love.
461Co 16:15 Brothers, you know the household of Stephanas: they are the firstfruits of Achaia and have devoted themselves to serving the saints. I urge you
461Co 16:16 also to submit to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them.
461Co 16:17 I am delighted over the presence of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because these men have made up for your absence.
461Co 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people.
461Co 16:19 The churches of the Asian province greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, along with the church that meets in their home.
461Co 16:20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
461Co 16:21 This greeting is in my own hand-- Paul.
461Co 16:22 If anyone does not love the Lord, a curse be on him. Maranatha!
461Co 16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
461Co 16:24 My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
47
472Co 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and Timothy our brother: To God's church at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia.
472Co 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
472Co 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.
472Co 1:4 He comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
472Co 1:5 For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so our comfort overflows through Christ.
472Co 1:6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is experienced in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer.
472Co 1:7 And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you share in the sufferings, so you will share in the comfort.
472Co 1:8 For we don't want you to be unaware, brothers, of our affliction that took place in the province of Asia: we were completely overwhelmed-- beyond our strength-- so that we even despaired of life.
472Co 1:9 However, we personally had a death sentence within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.
472Co 1:10 He has delivered us from such a terrible death, and He will deliver us; we have placed our hope in Him that He will deliver us again.
472Co 1:11 And you can join in helping with prayer for us, so that thanks may be given by many on our behalf for the gift that came to us through [the prayers of] many.
472Co 1:12 For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with God-given sincerity and purity, not by fleshly wisdom but by God's grace.
472Co 1:13 Now we are writing you nothing other than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely--
472Co 1:14 as you have partially understood us-- that we are your reason for pride, as you are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
472Co 1:15 In this confidence, I planned to come to you first, so you could have a double benefit,
472Co 1:16 and to go on to Macedonia with your help, then come to you again from Macedonia and be given a start by you on my journey to Judea.
472Co 1:17 So when I planned this, was I irresponsible? Or what I plan, do I plan in a purely human way so that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" [simultaneously]?
472Co 1:18 As God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes and no."
472Co 1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us-- by me and Silvanus and Timothy-- did not become "Yes and no"; on the contrary, "Yes" has come about in Him.
472Co 1:20 For every one of God's promises is "Yes" in Him. Therefore the "Amen" is also through Him for God's glory through us.
472Co 1:21 Now the One who confirms us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;
472Co 1:22 He has also sealed us and given us the Spirit as a down payment in our hearts.
472Co 1:23 I call on God as a witness against me: it was to spare you that I did not come to Corinth.
472Co 1:24 Not that we have control of your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand by faith.
472Co 2:1 In fact, I made up my mind about this: not to come to you on another painful visit.
472Co 2:2 For if I cause you pain, then who will cheer me other than the one hurt?
472Co 2:3 I wrote this very thing so that when I came I wouldn't have pain from those who ought to give me joy, because I am confident about all of you that my joy is yours.
472Co 2:4 For out of an extremely troubled and anguished heart I wrote to you with many tears-- not that you should be hurt, but that you should know the abundant love I have for you.
472Co 2:5 If anyone has caused pain, he has not caused pain to me, but in some degree-- not to exaggerate-- to all of you.
472Co 2:6 The punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person,
472Co 2:7 so now you should forgive and comfort him instead; otherwise, this one may be overwhelmed by excessive grief.
472Co 2:8 Therefore I urge you to confirm your love to him.
472Co 2:9 It was for this purpose I wrote: so I may know your proven character, if you are obedient in everything.
472Co 2:10 Now to whom you forgive anything, I do too. For what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for you in the presence of Christ,
472Co 2:11 so that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his intentions.
472Co 2:12 When I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, a door was opened to me by the Lord.
472Co 2:13 I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find my brother Titus, but I said good-bye to them and left for Macedonia.
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God, who always puts us on display in Christ, and spreads through us in every place the scent of knowing Him.
472Co 2:15 For to God we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
472Co 2:16 To some we are a scent of death leading to death, but to others, a scent of life leading to life. And who is competent for this?
472Co 2:17 For we are not like the many who make a trade in God's message [for profit], but as those with sincerity, we speak in Christ, as from God and before God.
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or like some, do we need letters of recommendation to you or from you?
472Co 3:2 You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, recognized and read by everyone,
472Co 3:3 since it is plain that you are Christ's letter, produced by us, not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tablets but on tablets that are hearts of flesh.
472Co 3:4 We have this kind of confidence toward God through Christ:
472Co 3:5 not that we are competent in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our competence is from God.
472Co 3:6 He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit produces life.
472Co 3:7 Now if the ministry of death, chiseled in letters on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look directly at Moses' face because of the glory from his face-- a fading [glory]--
472Co 3:8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?
472Co 3:9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness overflows with even more glory.
472Co 3:10 In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious in this case because of the glory that surpasses it.
472Co 3:11 For if what was fading away was glorious, what endures will be even more glorious.
472Co 3:12 Therefore having such a hope, we use great boldness--
472Co 3:13 not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel could not look at the end of what was fading away.
472Co 3:14 But their minds were closed. For to this day, at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; it is not lifted, because it is set aside [only] in Christ.
472Co 3:15 However, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts,
472Co 3:16 but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
472Co 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
472Co 3:18 We all, with unveiled faces, are reflecting the glory of the Lord and are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory; this is from the Lord who is the Spirit.
472Co 4:1 Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not give up.
472Co 4:2 Instead, we have renounced shameful secret things, not walking in deceit or distorting God's message, but in God's sight we commend ourselves to every person's conscience by an open display of the truth.
472Co 4:3 But if, in fact, our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
472Co 4:4 Regarding them: the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
472Co 4:5 For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves because of Jesus.
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness"-- He has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ.
472Co 4:7 Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so that this extraordinary power may be from God and not from us.
472Co 4:8 We are pressured in every way but not crushed; we are perplexed but not in despair;
472Co 4:9 we are persecuted but not abandoned; we are struck down but not destroyed.
472Co 4:10 We always carry the death of Jesus in our body, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
472Co 4:11 For we who live are always given over to death because of Jesus, so that Jesus' life may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.
472Co 4:12 So death works in us, but life in you.
472Co 4:13 And since we have the same spirit of faith in accordance with what is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we also believe, and therefore speak,
472Co 4:14 knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and present us with you.
472Co 4:15 For all this is because of you, so that grace, extended through more and more people, may cause thanksgiving to overflow to God's glory.
472Co 4:16 Therefore we do not give up; even though our outer person is being destroyed, our inner person is being renewed day by day.
472Co 4:17 For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an absolutely incomparable eternal weight of glory.
472Co 4:18 So we do not focus on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
472Co 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house, a tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
472Co 5:2 And, in fact, we groan in this one, longing to put on our house from heaven,
472Co 5:3 since, when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
472Co 5:4 Indeed, we who are in this tent groan, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life.
472Co 5:5 And the One who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.
472Co 5:6 Therefore, though we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord--
472Co 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight--
472Co 5:8 yet we are confident and satisfied to be out of the body and at home with the Lord.
472Co 5:9 Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing to Him.
472Co 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may be repaid for what he has done in the body, whether good or bad.
472Co 5:11 Knowing, then, the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. We are completely open before God, and I hope we are completely open to your consciences as well.
472Co 5:12 We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who take pride in the outward appearance rather than in the heart.
472Co 5:13 For if we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we have a sound mind, it is for you.
472Co 5:14 For Christ's love compels us, since we have reached this conclusion: if One died for all, then all died.
472Co 5:15 And He died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the One who died for them and was raised.
472Co 5:16 From now on, then, we do not know anyone in a purely human way. Even if we have known Christ in a purely human way, yet now we no longer know Him like that.
472Co 5:17 Therefore if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things have come.
472Co 5:18 Now everything is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
472Co 5:19 that is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed the message of reconciliation to us.
472Co 5:20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ; certain that God is appealing through us, we plead on Christ's behalf, "Be reconciled to God."
472Co 5:21 He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
472Co 6:1 Working together with Him, we also appeal to you: "Don't receive God's grace in vain."
472Co 6:2 For He says: In an acceptable time, I heard you, and in the day of salvation, I helped you. Look, now is the acceptable time; look, now is the day of salvation.
472Co 6:3 We give no opportunity for stumbling to anyone, so that the ministry will not be blamed.
472Co 6:4 But in everything, as God's ministers, we commend ourselves: by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardship, by pressures,
472Co 6:5 by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times of hunger,
472Co 6:6 by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,
472Co 6:7 by the message of truth, by the power of God; through weapons of righteousness on the right hand and the left,
472Co 6:8 through glory and dishonor, through slander and good report; as deceivers yet true;
472Co 6:9 as unknown yet recognized; as dying and look-- we live; as being chastened yet not killed;
472Co 6:10 as grieving yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing yet possessing everything.
472Co 6:11 We have spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide.
472Co 6:12 You are not limited by us, but you are limited by your own affections.
472Co 6:13 Now in like response-- I speak as to children-- you also should be open to us.
472Co 6:14 Do not be mismatched with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
472Co 6:15 What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
472Co 6:16 And what agreement does God's sanctuary have with idols? For we are the sanctuary of the living God, as God said: I will dwell among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
472Co 6:17 Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord; do not touch any unclean thing, and I will welcome you.
472Co 6:18 I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.
472Co 7:1 Therefore dear friends, since we have such promises, we should wash ourselves clean from every impurity of the flesh and spirit, making our sanctification complete in the fear of God.
472Co 7:2 Take us into your hearts. We have wronged no one, corrupted no one, defrauded no one.
472Co 7:3 I don't say this to condemn you, for I have already said that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
472Co 7:4 I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you. I am filled with encouragement; I am overcome with joy in all our afflictions.
472Co 7:5 In fact, when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest. Instead, we were afflicted in every way: struggles on the outside, fears inside.
472Co 7:6 But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
472Co 7:7 and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort he received from you. He announced to us your deep longing, your sorrow, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.
472Co 7:8 For although I grieved you with my letter, I do not regret it-- even though I did regret it since I saw that the letter grieved you, though only for a little while.
472Co 7:9 Now I am rejoicing, not because you were grieved, but because your grief led to repentance. For you were grieved as God willed, so that you didn't experience any loss from us.
472Co 7:10 For godly grief produces a repentance not to be regretted and leading to salvation, but worldly grief produces death.
472Co 7:11 For consider how much diligence this very thing-- this grieving as God wills-- has produced in you: what a desire to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what deep longing, what zeal, what justice! In every way you have commended yourselves to be pure in this matter.
472Co 7:12 So even though I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong, or because of the one who was wronged, but in order that your diligence for us might be made plain to you in the sight of God.
472Co 7:13 For this reason we have been comforted. In addition to our comfort, we were made to rejoice even more over the joy Titus had, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
472Co 7:14 For if I have made any boast to him about you, I have not been embarrassed; but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, so our boasting to Titus has also turned out to be the truth.
472Co 7:15 And his affection toward you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you, and how you received him with fear and trembling.
472Co 7:16 I rejoice that I have complete confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God granted to the churches of Macedonia:
472Co 8:2 during a severe testing by affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed into the wealth of their generosity.
472Co 8:3 I testify that, on their own, according to their ability and beyond their ability,
472Co 8:4 they begged us insistently for the privilege of sharing in the ministry to the saints,
472Co 8:5 and not just as we had hoped. Instead, they gave themselves especially to the Lord, then to us by God's will.
472Co 8:6 So we urged Titus that, just as he had begun, so he should also complete this grace to you.
472Co 8:7 Now as you excel in everything-- in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us-- excel also in this grace.
472Co 8:8 I am not saying this as a command. Rather, by means of the diligence of others, I am testing the genuineness of your love.
472Co 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: although He was rich, for your sake He became poor, so that by His poverty you might become rich.
472Co 8:10 Now I am giving an opinion on this because it is profitable for you, who a year ago began not only to do something but also to desire it.
472Co 8:11 But now finish the task as well, that just as there was eagerness to desire it, so there may also be a completion from what you have.
472Co 8:12 For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
472Co 8:13 It is not that there may be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a question of equality--
472Co 8:14 at the present time your surplus is [available] for their need, so that their abundance may also become [available] for your need, that there may be equality.
472Co 8:15 As it has been written: The person who gathered much did not have too much, and the person who gathered little did not have too little.
472Co 8:16 Thanks be to God who put the same diligence for you into the heart of Titus.
472Co 8:17 For he accepted our urging and, being very diligent, went out to you by his own choice.
472Co 8:18 With him we have sent the brother who is praised throughout the churches for his gospel ministry.
472Co 8:19 And not only that, but he was also appointed by the churches to accompany us with this gift that is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness [to help].
472Co 8:20 We are taking this precaution so no one can find fault with us concerning this large sum administered by us.
472Co 8:21 For we are making provision for what is honorable, not only before the Lord but also before men.
472Co 8:22 We have also sent with them our brother whom we have often tested, in many circumstances, and found diligent-- and now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you.
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker serving you; as for our brothers, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
472Co 8:24 Therefore, before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our boasting about you.
472Co 9:1 Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you.
472Co 9:2 For I know your eagerness, and I brag about you to the Macedonians: "Achaia has been prepared since last year," and your zeal has stirred up most of them.
472Co 9:3 But I sent the brothers so our boasting about you in the matter would not prove empty, and so you would be prepared just as I said.
472Co 9:4 For if any Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, would be embarrassed in that situation.
472Co 9:5 Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance the generous gift you promised, so that it will be ready as a gift and not an extortion.
472Co 9:6 Remember this: the person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously.
472Co 9:7 Each person should do as he has decided in his heart-- not out of regret or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
472Co 9:8 And God is able to make every grace overflow to you, so that in every way, always having everything you need, you may excel in every good work.
472Co 9:9 As it is written: He has scattered; He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.
472Co 9:10 Now the One who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness,
472Co 9:11 as you are enriched in every way for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us.
472Co 9:12 For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many acts of thanksgiving to God.
472Co 9:13 Through the proof of this service, they will glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with others.
472Co 9:14 And in their prayers for you they will have deep affection for you because of the surpassing grace of God on you.
472Co 9:15 Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift.
472Co 10:1 Now I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the gentleness and graciousness of Christ-- I who am humble among you in person, but bold toward you when absent.
472Co 10:2 I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are walking in a fleshly way.
472Co 10:3 For although we are walking in the flesh, we do not wage war in a fleshly way,
472Co 10:4 since the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but are powerful through God for the demolition of strongholds. We demolish arguments
472Co 10:5 and every high-minded thing that is raised up against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
472Co 10:6 And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
472Co 10:7 Look at what is obvious. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: just as he belongs to Christ, so do we.
472Co 10:8 For if I boast some more about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I am not ashamed.
472Co 10:9 I don't want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters.
472Co 10:10 For it is said, "His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak, and his public speaking is despicable."
472Co 10:11 Such a person should consider this: what we are in the words of our letters when absent, we will be in actions when present.
472Co 10:12 For we don't dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. But in measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves to themselves, they lack understanding.
472Co 10:13 We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the area [of ministry] that God has assigned to us, [which] reaches even to you.
472Co 10:14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ.
472Co 10:15 We are not bragging beyond measure about other people's labors. But we have the hope that as your faith increases, our area [of ministry] will be greatly enlarged,
472Co 10:16 so that we may preach the gospel to the regions beyond you, not boasting about what has already been done in someone else's area [of ministry].
472Co 10:17 So the one who boasts must boast in the Lord.
472Co 10:18 For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends.
472Co 11:1 I wish you would put up with a little foolishness from me. Yes, do put up with me.
472Co 11:2 For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, because I have promised you in marriage to one husband-- to present a pure virgin to Christ.
472Co 11:3 But I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may be corrupted from a complete and pure devotion to Christ.
472Co 11:4 For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or you receive a different spirit, which you had not received, or a different gospel, which you had not accepted, you put up with it splendidly!
472Co 11:5 Now I consider myself in no way inferior to the "super-apostles."
472Co 11:6 Though untrained in public speaking, I am certainly not [untrained] in knowledge. Indeed, we have always made that clear to you in everything.
472Co 11:7 Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?
472Co 11:8 I robbed other churches by taking pay [from them] to minister to you.
472Co 11:9 When I was present with you and in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs. I have kept myself, and will keep myself, from burdening you in any way.
472Co 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.
472Co 11:11 Why? Because I don't love you? God knows I do!
472Co 11:12 But I will continue to do what I am doing, in order to cut off the opportunity of those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in what they are boasting about.
472Co 11:13 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
472Co 11:14 And no wonder! For Satan himself is disguised as an angel of light.
472Co 11:15 So it is no great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their destiny will be according to their works.
472Co 11:16 I repeat: no one should consider me a fool. But if [you do], at least accept me as a fool, so I too may boast a little.
472Co 11:17 What I say in this matter of boasting, I don't speak as the Lord would, but foolishly.
472Co 11:18 Since many boast from a human perspective, I will also boast.
472Co 11:19 For you gladly put up with fools since you are so smart!
472Co 11:20 In fact, you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone captures you, if someone dominates you, or if someone hits you in the face.
472Co 11:21 I say this to [our] shame: we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares [to boast]-- I am talking foolishly-- I also dare:
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
472Co 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? I'm talking like a madman-- I'm a better one: with far more labors, many more imprisonments, far worse beatings, near death many times.
472Co 11:24 Five times I received from the Jews 40 lashes minus one.
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day in the depths of the sea.
472Co 11:26 On frequent journeys, [I faced] dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the open country, dangers on the sea, and dangers among false brothers;
472Co 11:27 labor and hardship, many sleepless nights, hunger and thirst, often without food, cold, and lacking clothing.
472Co 11:28 Not to mention other things, there is the daily pressure on me: my care for all the churches.
472Co 11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?
472Co 11:30 If boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses.
472Co 11:31 The eternally blessed One, the God and Father of the Lord Jesus, knows I am not lying.
472Co 11:32 In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me,
472Co 11:33 so I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
472Co 12:1 It is necessary to boast; it is not helpful, but I will move on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
472Co 12:2 I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven 14 years ago. Whether he was in the body or out of the body, I don't know; God knows.
472Co 12:3 I know that this man-- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows--
472Co 12:4 was caught up into paradise. He heard inexpressible words, which a man is not allowed to speak.
472Co 12:5 I will boast about this person, but not about myself, except of my weaknesses.
472Co 12:6 For if I want to boast, I will not be a fool, because I will be telling the truth. But I will spare you, so that no one can credit me with something beyond what he sees in me or hears from me,
472Co 12:7 especially because of the extraordinary revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me so I would not exalt myself.
472Co 12:8 Concerning this, I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me.
472Co 12:9 But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may reside in me.
472Co 12:10 So because of Christ, I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in catastrophes, in persecutions, and in pressures. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
472Co 12:11 I have become a fool; you forced it on me. I ought to have been recommended by you, since I am in no way inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
472Co 12:12 The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all endurance-- not only signs but also wonders and miracles.
472Co 12:13 So in what way were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I personally did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Look! I am ready to come to you this third time. I will not burden you, for I am not seeking what is yours, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
472Co 12:15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
472Co 12:16 Now granted, I have not burdened you; yet sly as I am, I took you in by deceit!
472Co 12:17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent you?
472Co 12:18 I urged Titus [to come], and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Didn't we walk in the same spirit and in the same footsteps?
472Co 12:19 You have thought all along that we were defending ourselves to you. [No], in the sight of God we are speaking in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is for building you up.
472Co 12:20 For I fear that perhaps when I come I will not find you to be what I want, and I may not be found by you to be what you want; there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.
472Co 12:21 I fear that when I come my God will again humiliate me in your presence, and I will grieve for many who sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and promiscuity they practiced.
472Co 13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. On the testimony of two or three witnesses every word will be confirmed.
472Co 13:2 I gave warning, and I give warning-- as when I was present the second time, so now while I am absent-- to those who sinned before and to all the rest: if I come again, I will not be lenient,
472Co 13:3 since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful among you.
472Co 13:4 In fact, He was crucified in weakness, but He lives by God's power. For we also are weak in Him, yet toward you we will live with Him by God's power.
472Co 13:5 Test yourselves [to see] if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves. Or do you not recognize for yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?-- unless you fail the test.
472Co 13:6 And I hope you will recognize that we are not failing the test.
472Co 13:7 Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong, not that we may appear to pass the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we [may appear] to fail.
472Co 13:8 For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
472Co 13:9 In fact, we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray for this: your maturity.
472Co 13:10 This is why I am writing these things while absent, that when I am there I will not use severity, in keeping with the authority the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.
472Co 13:11 Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be restored, be encouraged, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.
472Co 13:13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.

48Gl 1:1 Paul, an apostle-- not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead--
48Gl 1:2 and all the brothers who are with me: To the churches of Galatia.
48Gl 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
48Gl 1:4 who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48Gl 1:5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from Him who called you by the grace of Christ, [and are turning] to a different gospel--
48Gl 1:7 not that there is another [gospel], but there are some who are troubling you and want to change the gospel of Christ.
48Gl 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you, a curse be on him!
48Gl 1:9 As we have said before, I now say again: if anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!
48Gl 1:10 For am I now trying to win the favor of people, or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.
48Gl 1:11 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not based on a human point of view.
48Gl 1:12 For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation from Jesus Christ.
48Gl 1:13 For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism: I persecuted God's church to an extreme degree and tried to destroy it;
48Gl 1:14 and I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
48Gl 1:15 But when God, who from my mother's womb set me apart and called me by His grace, was pleased
48Gl 1:16 to reveal His Son in me, so that I could preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone.
48Gl 1:17 I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him 15 days.
48Gl 1:19 But I didn't see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
48Gl 1:20 Now in what I write to you, I'm not lying. God is my witness.
48Gl 1:21 Afterwards, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
48Gl 1:22 I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches in Christ;
48Gl 1:23 they simply kept hearing: "He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy."
48Gl 1:24 And they glorified God because of me.
48Gl 2:1 Then after 14 years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.
48Gl 2:2 I went up because of a revelation and presented to them the gospel I preach among the Gentiles-- but privately to those recognized [as leaders]-- so that I might not be running, or have run, in vain.
48Gl 2:3 But not even Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
48Gl 2:4 [This issue arose] because of false brothers smuggled in, who came in secretly to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us.
48Gl 2:5 But we did not yield in submission to these people for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain for you.
48Gl 2:6 But from those recognized as important (what they really were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism)-- those recognized as important added nothing to me.
48Gl 2:7 On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter was for the circumcised.
48Gl 2:8 For He who was at work with Peter in the apostleship to the circumcised was also at work with me among the Gentiles.
48Gl 2:9 When James, Cephas, and John, recognized as pillars, acknowledged the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, [agreeing] that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
48Gl 2:10 [They asked] only that we would remember the poor, which I made every effort to do.
48Gl 2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.
48Gl 2:12 For he used to eat with the Gentiles before certain men came from James. However, when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he feared those from the circumcision party.
48Gl 2:13 Then the rest of the Jews joined his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
48Gl 2:14 But when I saw that they were deviating from the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, "If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel Gentiles to live like Jews?"
48Gl 2:15 We are Jews by birth and not "Gentile sinners";
48Gl 2:16 yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no human being will be justified.
48Gl 2:17 But if, while seeking to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are also found to be sinners, is Christ then a promoter of sin? Absolutely not!
48Gl 2:18 If I rebuild those things that I tore down, I show myself to be a lawbreaker.
48Gl 2:19 For through the law I have died to the law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ;
48Gl 2:20 and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.
48Gl 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
48Gl 3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who has hypnotized you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified?
48Gl 3:2 I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
48Gl 3:3 Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now going to be made complete by the flesh?
48Gl 3:4 Did you suffer so much for nothing-- if in fact it was for nothing?
48Gl 3:5 So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
48Gl 3:6 Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,
48Gl 3:7 so understand that those who have faith are Abraham's sons.
48Gl 3:8 Now the Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and foretold the good news to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed in you.
48Gl 3:9 So those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith.
48Gl 3:10 For all who [rely on] the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Cursed is everyone who does not continue doing everything written in the book of the law.
48Gl 3:11 Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith.
48Gl 3:12 But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them.
48Gl 3:13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written: Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.
48Gl 3:14 The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
48Gl 3:15 Brothers, I'm using a human illustration. No one sets aside even a human covenant that has been ratified, or makes additions to it.
48Gl 3:16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say "and to seeds," as though referring to many, but and to your seed, referring to one, who is Christ.
48Gl 3:17 And I say this: the law, which came 430 years later, does not revoke a covenant that was previously ratified by God, so as to cancel the promise.
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.
48Gl 3:19 Why the law then? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come. [The law] was ordered through angels by means of a mediator.
48Gl 3:20 Now a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one.
48Gl 3:21 Is the law therefore contrary to God's promises? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly be by the law.
48Gl 3:22 But the Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin's power, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
48Gl 3:23 Before this faith came, we were confined under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed.
48Gl 3:24 The law, then, was our guardian until Christ, so that we could be justified by faith.
48Gl 3:25 But since that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
48Gl 3:26 for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
48Gl 3:28 There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:29 And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to the promise.
48Gl 4:1 Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the owner of everything.
48Gl 4:2 Instead, he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by his father.
48Gl 4:3 In the same way we also, when we were children, were in slavery under the elemental forces of the world.
48Gl 4:4 But when the completion of the time came, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
48Gl 4:5 to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
48Gl 4:6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father!"
48Gl 4:7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
48Gl 4:8 But in the past, when you didn't know God, you were enslaved to things that by nature are not gods.
48Gl 4:9 But now, since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and bankrupt elemental forces? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?
48Gl 4:10 You observe [special] days, months, seasons, and years.
48Gl 4:11 I am fearful for you, that perhaps my labor for you has been wasted.
48Gl 4:12 I beg you, brothers: become like me, for I also became like you. You have not wronged me;
48Gl 4:13 you know that previously I preached the gospel to you in physical weakness,
48Gl 4:14 and though my physical condition was a trial for you, you did not despise or reject me. On the contrary, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus [Himself].
48Gl 4:15 What happened to this blessedness of yours? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48Gl 4:16 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48Gl 4:17 They are enthusiastic about you, but not for any good. Instead, they want to isolate you so you will be enthusiastic about them.
48Gl 4:18 Now it is always good to be enthusiastic about good-- and not just when I am with you.
48Gl 4:19 My children, again I am in the pains of childbirth for you until Christ is formed in you.
48Gl 4:20 I'd like to be with you right now and change my tone of voice, because I don't know what to do about you.
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, don't you hear the law?
48Gl 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and the other by a free woman.
48Gl 4:23 But the one by the slave was born according to the flesh, while the one by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.
48Gl 4:24 These things are illustrations, for the women represent the two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery-- this is Hagar.
48Gl 4:25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48Gl 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
48Gl 4:27 For it is written: Rejoice, O barren woman who does not give birth. Break forth and shout, you who are not in labor, for the children of the desolate are many, more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband.
48Gl 4:28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48Gl 4:29 But just as then the child born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so also now.
48Gl 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? Throw out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave will never inherit with the son of the free woman.
48Gl 4:31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.
48Gl 5:1 Christ has liberated us into freedom. Therefore stand firm and don't submit again to a yoke of slavery.
48Gl 5:2 Take note! I, Paul, tell you that if you get circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all.
48Gl 5:3 Again I testify to every man who gets circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.
48Gl 5:4 You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace!
48Gl 5:5 For by the Spirit we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness from faith.
48Gl 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?
48Gl 5:8 This persuasion did not come from Him who called you.
48Gl 5:9 A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough.
48Gl 5:10 In the Lord I have confidence in you that you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is who is troubling you will pay the penalty.
48Gl 5:11 Now brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
48Gl 5:12 I wish those who are disturbing you might also get themselves castrated!
48Gl 5:13 For you are called to freedom, brothers; only don't use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love.
48Gl 5:14 For the entire law is fulfilled in one statement: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
48Gl 5:15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another.
48Gl 5:16 I say then, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
48Gl 5:17 For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don't do what you want.
48Gl 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
48Gl 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity,
48Gl 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,
48Gl 5:21 envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar, about which I tell you in advance-- as I told you before-- that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
48Gl 5:23 gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.
48Gl 5:24 Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
48Gl 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.
48Gl 5:26 We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
48Gl 6:1 Brothers, if someone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore such a person with a gentle spirit, watching out for yourselves so you won't be tempted also.
48Gl 6:2 Carry one another's burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48Gl 6:3 For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing, he is deceiving himself.
48Gl 6:4 But each person should examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in respect to someone else.
48Gl 6:5 For each person will have to carry his own load.
48Gl 6:6 The one who is taught the message must share his goods with the teacher.
48Gl 6:7 Don't be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows he will also reap,
48Gl 6:8 because the one who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
48Gl 6:9 So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don't give up.
48Gl 6:10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, we must work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith.
48Gl 6:11 Look at what large letters I have written to you in my own handwriting.
48Gl 6:12 Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh are the ones who would compel you to be circumcised-- but only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48Gl 6:13 For even the circumcised don't keep the law themselves; however, they want you to be circumcised in order to boast about your flesh.
48Gl 6:14 But as for me, I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48Gl 6:15 For both circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; [what matters] instead is a new creation.
48Gl 6:16 May peace be on all those who follow this standard, and mercy also be on the Israel of God!
48Gl 6:17 From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I carry the marks of Jesus on my body.
48Gl 6:18 Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
49
49Eph 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will: To the saints and believers in Christ Jesus at Ephesus.
49Eph 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens, in Christ;
49Eph 1:4 for He chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in His sight. In love
49Eph 1:5 He predestined us to be adopted through Jesus Christ for Himself, according to His favor and will,
49Eph 1:6 to the praise of His glorious grace that He favored us with in the Beloved.
49Eph 1:7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace
49Eph 1:8 that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
49Eph 1:9 He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He planned in Him
49Eph 1:10 for the administration of the days of fulfillment-- to bring everything together in the Messiah, both things in heaven and things on earth in Him.
49Eph 1:11 In Him we were also made His inheritance, predestined according to the purpose of the One who works out everything in agreement with the decision of His will,
49Eph 1:12 so that we who had already put our hope in the Messiah might bring praise to His glory.
49Eph 1:13 In Him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation-- in Him when you believed-- were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.
49Eph 1:14 He is the down payment of our inheritance, for the redemption of the possession, to the praise of His glory.
49Eph 1:15 This is why, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
49Eph 1:16 I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers.
49Eph 1:17 [I pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
49Eph 1:18 [I pray] that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the glorious riches of His inheritance among the saints,
49Eph 1:19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of His power to us who believe, according to the working of His vast strength.
49Eph 1:20 He demonstrated [this power] in the Messiah by raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavens--
49Eph 1:21 far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
49Eph 1:22 And He put everything under His feet and appointed Him as head over everything for the church,
49Eph 1:23 which is His body, the fullness of the One who fills all things in every way.
49Eph 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins
49Eph 2:2 in which you previously walked according to this worldly age, according to the ruler of the atmospheric domain, the spirit now working in the disobedient.
49Eph 2:3 We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires, carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and by nature we were children under wrath, as the others were also.
49Eph 2:4 But God, who is abundant in mercy, because of His great love that He had for us,
49Eph 2:5 made us alive with the Messiah even though we were dead in trespasses. By grace you are saved!
49Eph 2:6 He also raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavens, in Christ Jesus,
49Eph 2:7 so that in the coming ages He might display the immeasurable riches of His grace in [His] kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God's gift--
49Eph 2:9 not from works, so that no one can boast.
49Eph 2:10 For we are His creation-- created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time so that we should walk in them.
49Eph 2:11 So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh-- called "the uncircumcised" by those called "the circumcised," done by hand in the flesh.
49Eph 2:12 At that time you were without the Messiah, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, with no hope and without God in the world.
49Eph 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah.
49Eph 2:14 For He is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In His flesh,
49Eph 2:15 He did away with the law of the commandments in regulations, so that He might create in Himself one new man from the two, resulting in peace.
49Eph 2:16 [He did this so] that He might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross and put the hostility to death by it.
49Eph 2:17 When [Christ] came, He proclaimed the good news of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
49Eph 2:18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
49Eph 2:19 So then you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God's household,
49Eph 2:20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.
49Eph 2:21 The whole building is being fitted together in Him and is growing into a holy sanctuary in the Lord,
49Eph 2:22 in whom you also are being built together for God's dwelling in the Spirit.
49Eph 3:1 For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles--
49Eph 3:2 you have heard, haven't you, about the administration of God's grace that He gave to me for you?
49Eph 3:3 The mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have briefly written above.
49Eph 3:4 By reading this you are able to understand my insight about the mystery of the Messiah.
49Eph 3:5 This was not made known to people in other generations as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
49Eph 3:6 the Gentiles are co-heirs, members of the same body, and partners of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
49Eph 3:7 I was made a servant of this [gospel] by the gift of God's grace that was given to me by the working of His power.
49Eph 3:8 This grace was given to me-- the least of all the saints!-- to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches of the Messiah,
49Eph 3:9 and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things.
49Eph 3:10 This is so that God's multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.
49Eph 3:11 This is according to the purpose of the ages, which He made in the Messiah, Jesus our Lord,
49Eph 3:12 in whom we have boldness, access, and confidence through faith in Him.
49Eph 3:13 So then I ask you not to be discouraged over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory.
49Eph 3:14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father
49Eph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.
49Eph 3:16 [I pray] that He may grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,
49Eph 3:17 and that the Messiah may dwell in your hearts through faith. [I pray that] you, being rooted and firmly established in love,
49Eph 3:18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and width, height and depth,
49Eph 3:19 and to know the Messiah's love that surpasses knowledge, so you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
49Eph 3:20 Now to Him who is able to do above and beyond all that we ask or think-- according to the power that works in you--
49Eph 3:21 to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
49Eph 4:1 I, therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received,
49Eph 4:2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, accepting one another in love,
49Eph 4:3 diligently keeping the unity of the Spirit with the peace that binds [us].
49Eph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope at your calling;
49Eph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.
49Eph 4:7 Now grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of the Messiah's gift.
49Eph 4:8 For it says: When He ascended on high, He took prisoners into captivity; He gave gifts to people.
49Eph 4:9 But what does "He ascended" mean except that He descended to the lower parts of the earth?
49Eph 4:10 The One who descended is the same as the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.
49Eph 4:11 And He personally gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,
49Eph 4:12 for the training of the saints in the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,
49Eph 4:13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God's Son, [growing] into a mature man with a stature measured by Christ's fullness.
49Eph 4:14 Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching, by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit.
49Eph 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into Him who is the head-- Christ.
49Eph 4:16 From Him the whole body, fitted and knit together by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth of the body for building up itself in love by the proper working of each individual part.
49Eph 4:17 Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer walk as the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their thoughts.
49Eph 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because of the hardness of their hearts.
49Eph 4:19 They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity with a desire for more and more.
49Eph 4:20 But that is not how you learned about the Messiah,
49Eph 4:21 assuming you heard Him and were taught by Him, because the truth is in Jesus:
49Eph 4:22 you took off your former way of life, the old man that is corrupted by deceitful desires;
49Eph 4:23 you are being renewed in the spirit of your minds;
49Eph 4:24 you put on the new man, the one created according to God's [likeness] in righteousness and purity of the truth.
49Eph 4:25 Since you put away lying, Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor, because we are members of one another.
49Eph 4:26 Be angry and do not sin. Don't let the sun go down on your anger,
49Eph 4:27 and don't give the Devil an opportunity.
49Eph 4:28 The thief must no longer steal. Instead, he must do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share with anyone in need.
49Eph 4:29 No rotten talk should come from your mouth, but only what is good for the building up of someone in need, in order to give grace to those who hear.
49Eph 4:30 And don't grieve God's Holy Spirit, who sealed you for the day of redemption.
49Eph 4:31 All bitterness, anger and wrath, insult and slander must be removed from you, along with all wickedness.
49Eph 4:32 And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ.
49Eph 5:1 Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children.
49Eph 5:2 And walk in love, as the Messiah also loved us and gave Himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God.
49Eph 5:3 But sexual immorality and any impurity or greed should not even be heard of among you, as is proper for saints.
49Eph 5:4 And coarse and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks.
49Eph 5:5 For know and recognize this: no sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God.
49Eph 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for because of these things God's wrath is coming on the disobedient.
49Eph 5:7 Therefore, do not become their partners.
49Eph 5:8 For you were once darkness, but now [you are] light in the Lord. Walk as children of light--
49Eph 5:9 for the fruit of the light [results] in all goodness, righteousness, and truth--
49Eph 5:10 discerning what is pleasing to the Lord.
49Eph 5:11 Don't participate in the fruitless works of darkness, but instead, expose them.
49Eph 5:12 For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret.
49Eph 5:13 Everything exposed by the light is made clear,
49Eph 5:14 for what makes everything clear is light. Therefore it is said: Get up, sleeper, and rise up from the dead, and the Messiah will shine on you.
49Eph 5:15 Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk-- not as unwise people but as wise--
49Eph 5:16 making the most of the time, because the days are evil.
49Eph 5:17 So don't be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
49Eph 5:18 And don't get drunk with wine, which [leads to] reckless actions, but be filled with the Spirit:
49Eph 5:19 speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music to the Lord in your heart,
49Eph 5:20 giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
49Eph 5:21 submitting to one another in the fear of Christ.
49Eph 5:22 Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,
49Eph 5:23 for the husband is head of the wife as also Christ is head of the church. He is the Savior of the body.
49Eph 5:24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so wives should [submit] to their husbands in everything.
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as also Christ loved the church and gave Himself for her,
49Eph 5:26 to make her holy, cleansing her in the washing of water by the word.
49Eph 5:27 He did this to present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.
49Eph 5:28 In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49Eph 5:29 For no one ever hates his own flesh, but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,
49Eph 5:30 since we are members of His body.
49Eph 5:31 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.
49Eph 5:32 This mystery is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church.
49Eph 5:33 To sum up, each one of you is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband.
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, because this is right.
49Eph 6:2 Honor your father and mother-- which is the first commandment with a promise--
49Eph 6:3 that it may go well with you and that you may have a long life in the land.
49Eph 6:4 And fathers, don't stir up anger in your children, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ.
49Eph 6:6 Don't [work only] while being watched, in order to please men, but as slaves of Christ, do God's will from your heart.
49Eph 6:7 Render service with a good attitude, as to the Lord and not to men,
49Eph 6:8 knowing that whatever good each one does, slave or free, he will receive this back from the Lord.
49Eph 6:9 And masters, treat them the same way, without threatening them, because you know that both their and your Master is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
49Eph 6:10 Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by His vast strength.
49Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the tactics of the Devil.
49Eph 6:12 For our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens.
49Eph 6:13 This is why you must take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand.
49Eph 6:14 Stand, therefore, with truth like a belt around your waist, righteousness like armor on your chest,
49Eph 6:15 and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace.
49Eph 6:16 In every situation take the shield of faith, and with it you will be able to extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49Eph 6:17 Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word.
49Eph 6:18 With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and stay alert in this, with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints.
49Eph 6:19 Pray also for me, that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel.
49Eph 6:20 For this I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I might be bold enough in Him to speak as I should.
49Eph 6:21 Tychicus, our dearly loved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything so that you also may know how I am and what I'm doing.
49Eph 6:22 I am sending him to you for this very reason, to let you know how we are and to encourage your hearts.
49Eph 6:23 Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 6:24 Grace be with all who have undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.

50Php 1:1 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus: To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons.
50Php 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:3 I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you,
50Php 1:4 always praying with joy for all of you in my every prayer,
50Php 1:5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
50Php 1:6 I am sure of this, that He who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:7 It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart, and you are all partners with me in grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and establishment of the gospel.
50Php 1:8 For God is my witness, how I deeply miss all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:9 And I pray this: that your love will keep on growing in knowledge and every kind of discernment,
50Php 1:10 so that you can determine what really matters and can be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,
50Php 1:11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that [comes] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
50Php 1:12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advancement of the gospel,
50Php 1:13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard, and to everyone else, that my imprisonment is for Christ.
50Php 1:14 Most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the message fearlessly.
50Php 1:15 Some, to be sure, preach Christ out of envy and strife, but others out of good will.
50Php 1:16 These do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;
50Php 1:17 the others proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely, seeking to cause [me] trouble in my imprisonment.
50Php 1:18 What does it matter? Just that in every way, whether out of false motives or true, Christ is proclaimed. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice
50Php 1:19 because I know this will lead to my deliverance through your prayers and help from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:20 My eager expectation and hope is that I will not be ashamed about anything, but that now as always, with all boldness, Christ will be highly honored in my body, whether by life or by death.
50Php 1:21 For me, living is Christ and dying is gain.
50Php 1:22 Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful work for me; and I don't know which one I should choose.
50Php 1:23 I am pressured by both. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ-- which is far better--
50Php 1:24 but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.
50Php 1:25 Since I am persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your advancement and joy in the faith,
50Php 1:26 so that, because of me, your confidence may grow in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.
50Php 1:27 Just one thing: live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or am absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, working side by side for the faith of the gospel,
50Php 1:28 not being frightened in any way by your opponents. This is evidence of their destruction, but of your deliverance-- and this is from God.
50Php 1:29 For it has been given to you on Christ's behalf not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,
50Php 1:30 having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear about me.
50Php 2:1 If then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,
50Php 2:2 fulfill my joy by thinking the same way, having the same love, sharing the same feelings, focusing on one goal.
50Php 2:3 Do nothing out of rivalry or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves.
50Php 2:4 Everyone should look out not [only] for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.
50Php 2:5 Make your own attitude that of Christ Jesus,
50Php 2:6 who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be used for His own advantage.
50Php 2:7 Instead He emptied Himself by assuming the form of a slave, taking on the likeness of men. And when He had come as a man in His external form,
50Php 2:8 He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death-- even to death on a cross.
50Php 2:9 For this reason God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name,
50Php 2:10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow-- of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth--
50Php 2:11 and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50Php 2:12 So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
50Php 2:13 For it is God who is working in you, [enabling you] both to will and to act for His good purpose.
50Php 2:14 Do everything without grumbling and arguing,
50Php 2:15 so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God who are faultless in a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world.
50Php 2:16 Hold firmly the message of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I didn't run in vain or labor for nothing.
50Php 2:17 But even if I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
50Php 2:18 In the same way you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.
50Php 2:19 Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I also may be encouraged when I hear news about you.
50Php 2:20 For I have no one else like-minded who will genuinely care about your interests;
50Php 2:21 all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50Php 2:22 But you know his proven character, because he has served with me in the gospel ministry like a son with a father.
50Php 2:23 Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
50Php 2:24 And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will also come quickly.
50Php 2:25 But I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus-- my brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier, as well as your messenger and minister to my need--
50Php 2:26 since he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick.
50Php 2:27 Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly died. However, God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one grief on top of another.
50Php 2:28 For this reason, I am very eager to send him so that you may rejoice when you see him again and I may be less anxious.
50Php 2:29 Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in honor,
50Php 2:30 because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up what was lacking in your ministry to me.
50Php 3:1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write to you again about this is no trouble for me and is a protection for you.
50Php 3:2 Watch out for "dogs," watch out for evil workers, watch out for those who mutilate the flesh.
50Php 3:3 For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and do not put confidence in the flesh--
50Php 3:4 although I once had confidence in the flesh too. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
50Php 3:5 circumcised the eighth day; of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
50Php 3:6 as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness that is in the law, blameless.
50Php 3:7 But everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ.
50Php 3:8 More than that, I also consider everything to be a loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of Him I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them filth, so that I may gain Christ
50Php 3:9 and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that is through faith in Christ-- the righteousness from God based on faith.
50Php 3:10 [My goal] is to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
50Php 3:11 assuming that I will somehow reach the resurrection from among the dead.
50Php 3:12 Not that I have already reached [the goal] or am already fully mature, but I make every effort to take hold of it because I also have been taken hold of by Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:13 Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead,
50Php 3:14 I pursue as my goal the prize promised by God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:15 Therefore, all who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will reveal this to you also.
50Php 3:16 In any case, we should live up to whatever [truth] we have attained.
50Php 3:17 Join in imitating me, brothers, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us.
50Php 3:18 For I have often told you, and now say again with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
50Php 3:19 Their end is destruction; their god is their stomach; their glory is in their shame. They are focused on earthly things,
50Php 3:20 but our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
50Php 3:21 He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of His glorious body, by the power that enables Him to subject everything to Himself.
50Php 4:1 So then, in this way, my dearly loved brothers, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.
50Php 4:2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord.
50Php 4:3 Yes, I also ask you, true partner, to help these women who have contended for the gospel at my side, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers whose names are in the book of life.
50Php 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
50Php 4:5 Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.
50Php 4:6 Don't worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
50Php 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasses every thought, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:8 Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable-- if there is any moral excellence and if there is any praise-- dwell on these things.
50Php 4:9 Do what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
50Php 4:10 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have renewed your care for me. You were, in fact, concerned about me, but lacked the opportunity [to show it].
50Php 4:11 I don't say this out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
50Php 4:12 I know both how to have a little, and I know how to have a lot. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret [of being content]-- whether well-fed or hungry, whether in abundance or in need.
50Php 4:13 I am able to do all things through Him who strengthens me.
50Php 4:14 Still, you did well by sharing with me in my hardship.
50Php 4:15 And you, Philippians, know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone.
50Php 4:16 For even in Thessalonica you sent [gifts] for my need several times.
50Php 4:17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that is increasing to your account.
50Php 4:18 But I have received everything in full, and I have an abundance. I am fully supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you provided-- a fragrant offering, a welcome sacrifice, pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:20 Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
50Php 4:21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. Those brothers who are with me greet you.
50Php 4:22 All the saints greet you, but especially those from Caesar's household.
50Php 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
51
51Col 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and Timothy our brother:
51Col 1:2 To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ in Colossae. Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
51Col 1:3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51Col 1:4 for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints
51Col 1:5 because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. You have already heard about [this hope] in the message of truth,
51Col 1:6 the gospel that has come to you. It is bearing fruit and growing all over the world, just as it has among you since the day you heard it and recognized God's grace in the truth.
51Col 1:7 You learned this from Epaphras, our much loved fellow slave. He is a faithful minister of the Messiah on your behalf,
51Col 1:8 and he has told us about your love in the Spirit.
51Col 1:9 For this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven't stopped praying for you. We are asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
51Col 1:10 so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing [to Him], bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God.
51Col 1:11 May you be strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience, with joy
51Col 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the saints' inheritance in the light.
51Col 1:13 He has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves,
51Col 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51Col 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation;
51Col 1:16 because by Him everything was created, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities-- all things have been created through Him and for Him.
51Col 1:17 He is before all things, and by Him all things hold together.
51Col 1:18 He is also the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He might come to have first place in everything.
51Col 1:19 For God was pleased [to have] all His fullness dwell in Him,
51Col 1:20 and through Him to reconcile everything to Himself by making peace through the blood of His cross-- whether things on earth or things in heaven.
51Col 1:21 And you were once alienated and hostile in mind because of your evil actions.
51Col 1:22 But now He has reconciled you by His physical body through His death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before Him--
51Col 1:23 if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith, and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard. [This gospel] has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become a minister of it.
51Col 1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I am completing in my flesh what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for His body, that is, the church.
51Col 1:25 I have become its minister, according to God's administration that was given to me for you, to make God's message fully known,
51Col 1:26 the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to His saints.
51Col 1:27 God wanted to make known to those among the Gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51Col 1:28 We proclaim Him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ.
51Col 1:29 I labor for this, striving with His strength that works powerfully in me.
51Col 2:1 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me in person.
51Col 2:2 [I want] their hearts to be encouraged and joined together in love, so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding, and have the knowledge of God's mystery-- Christ.
51Col 2:3 In Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
51Col 2:4 I am saying this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive arguments.
51Col 2:5 For I may be absent in body, but I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the strength of your faith in Christ.
51Col 2:6 Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him,
51Col 2:7 rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
51Col 2:8 Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition, based on the elemental forces of the world, and not based on Christ.
51Col 2:9 For in Him the entire fullness of God's nature dwells bodily,
51Col 2:10 and you have been filled by Him, who is the head over every ruler and authority.
51Col 2:11 In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh, in the circumcision of the Messiah.
51Col 2:12 Having been buried with Him in baptism, you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
51Col 2:13 And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive with Him and forgave us all our trespasses.
51Col 2:14 He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross.
51Col 2:15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; He triumphed over them by Him.
51Col 2:16 Therefore don't let anyone judge you in regard to food and drink or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or a sabbath day.
51Col 2:17 These are a shadow of what was to come; the substance is the Messiah.
51Col 2:18 Let no one disqualify you, insisting on ascetic practices and the worship of angels, claiming access to a visionary realm and inflated without cause by his fleshly mind.
51Col 2:19 He doesn't hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and tendons, develops with growth from God.
51Col 2:20 If you died with Christ to the elemental forces of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations:
51Col 2:21 "Don't handle, don't taste, don't touch"?
51Col 2:22 All these [regulations] refer to what is destroyed by being used up; they are human commands and doctrines.
51Col 2:23 Although these have a reputation of wisdom by promoting ascetic practices, humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value against fleshly indulgence.
51Col 3:1 So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God.
51Col 3:2 Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth.
51Col 3:3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God.
51Col 3:4 When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
51Col 3:5 Therefore, put to death whatever in you is worldly: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and greed, which is idolatry.
51Col 3:6 Because of these, God's wrath comes on the disobedient,
51Col 3:7 and you once walked in these things when you were living in them.
51Col 3:8 But now you must also put away all the following: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices
51Col 3:10 and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of his Creator.
51Col 3:11 Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all.
51Col 3:12 Therefore, God's chosen ones, holy and loved, put on heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,
51Col 3:13 accepting one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must [forgive].
51Col 3:14 Above all, [put on] love-- the perfect bond of unity.
51Col 3:15 And let the peace of the Messiah, to which you were also called in one body, control your hearts. Be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the message about the Messiah dwell richly among you, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, and singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, with gratitude in your hearts to God.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
51Col 3:18 Wives, be submissive to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives and don't become bitter against them.
51Col 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so they won't become discouraged.
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your human masters in everything; don't work only while being watched, in order to please men, but [work] wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, do it enthusiastically, as something done for the Lord and not for men,
51Col 3:24 knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord-- you serve the Lord Christ.
51Col 3:25 For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism.
51Col 4:1 Masters, supply your slaves with what is right and fair, since you know that you too have a Master in heaven.
51Col 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving.
51Col 4:3 At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door to us for the message, to speak the mystery of the Messiah-- for which I am in prison--
51Col 4:4 so that I may reveal it as I am required to speak.
51Col 4:5 Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the time.
51Col 4:6 Your speech should always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person.
51Col 4:7 Tychicus, a loved brother, a faithful servant, and a fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me.
51Col 4:8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are, and so that he may encourage your hearts.
51Col 4:9 He is with Onesimus, a faithful and loved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as does Mark, Barnabas' cousin (concerning whom you have received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),
51Col 4:11 and so does Jesus who is called Justus. These alone of the circumcision are my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always contending for you in his prayers, so that you can stand mature and fully assured in everything God wills.
51Col 4:13 For I testify about him that he works hard for you, for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.
51Col 4:14 Luke, the loved physician, and Demas greet you.
51Col 4:15 Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51Col 4:16 And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
51Col 4:17 And tell Archippus, "Pay attention to the ministry you have received in the Lord, so that you can accomplish it."
51Col 4:18 This greeting is in my own hand-- Paul. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.

521Th 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.
521Th 1:2 We always thank God for all of you, remembering you constantly in our prayers.
521Th 1:3 We recall, in the presence of our God and Father, your work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,
521Th 1:4 knowing your election, brothers loved by God.
521Th 1:5 For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we were among you for your benefit,
521Th 1:6 and you became imitators of us and of the Lord when, in spite of severe persecution, you welcomed the message with the joy from the Holy Spirit.
521Th 1:7 As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
521Th 1:8 For the Lord's message rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place that your faith in God has gone out, so we don't need to say anything.
521Th 1:9 For they themselves report about us what kind of reception we had from you: how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
521Th 1:10 and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead-- Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
521Th 2:1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit with you was not without result.
521Th 2:2 On the contrary, after we had previously suffered and been outrageously treated in Philippi, as you know, we were emboldened by our God to speak the gospel of God to you in spite of great opposition.
521Th 2:3 For our exhortation didn't come from error or impurity or an intent to deceive.
521Th 2:4 Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but rather God, who examines our hearts.
521Th 2:5 For we never used flattering speech, as you know, or had greedy motives-- God is our witness--
521Th 2:6 and we didn't seek glory from people, either from you or from others.
521Th 2:7 Although we could have been a burden as Christ's apostles, instead we were gentle among you, as a nursing mother nurtures her own children.
521Th 2:8 We cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.
521Th 2:9 For you remember our labor and hardship, brothers. Working night and day so that we would not burden any of you, we preached God's gospel to you.
521Th 2:10 You are witnesses, and so is God, of how devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves with you believers.
521Th 2:11 As you know, like a father with his own children,
521Th 2:12 we encouraged, comforted, and implored each one of you to walk worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
521Th 2:13 Also, this is why we constantly thank God, because when you received the message about God that you heard from us, you welcomed it not as a human message, but as it truly is, the message of God, which also works effectively in you believers.
521Th 2:14 For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, since you have also suffered the same things from people of your own country, just as they did from the Jews.
521Th 2:15 They killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us; they displease God, and are hostile to everyone,
521Th 2:16 hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. As a result, they are always adding to the number of their sins, and wrath has overtaken them completely.
521Th 2:17 But as for us, brothers, after we were forced to leave you for a short time (in person, not in heart), we greatly desired and made every effort to return and see you face to face.
521Th 2:18 So we wanted to come to you-- even I, Paul, time and again-- but Satan hindered us.
521Th 2:19 For who is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?
521Th 2:20 For you are our glory and joy!
521Th 3:1 Therefore, when we could no longer stand it, we thought it was better to be left alone in Athens.
521Th 3:2 And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's co-worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you concerning your faith,
521Th 3:3 so that no one will be shaken by these persecutions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.
521Th 3:4 In fact, when we were with you, we told you previously that we were going to suffer persecution, and as you know, it happened.
521Th 3:5 For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I also sent to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might be for nothing.
521Th 3:6 But now Timothy has come to us from you and brought us good news about your faith and love, and that you always have good memories of us, wanting to see us, as we also want to see you.
521Th 3:7 Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution, we were encouraged about you through your faith.
521Th 3:8 For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 How can we thank God for you in return for all the joy we experience because of you before our God,
521Th 3:10 as we pray earnestly night and day to see you face to face and to complete what is lacking in your faith?
521Th 3:11 Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you.
521Th 3:12 And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone, just as we also do for you.
521Th 3:13 May He make your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. Amen.
521Th 4:1 Finally then, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us how you must walk and please God-- as you are doing-- do so even more.
521Th 4:2 For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 For this is God's will, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality,
521Th 4:4 so that each of you knows how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
521Th 4:5 not with lustful desires, like the Gentiles who don't know God.
521Th 4:6 This means one must not transgress against and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all these offenses, as we also previously told and warned you.
521Th 4:7 For God has not called us to impurity, but to sanctification.
521Th 4:8 Therefore, the person who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who also gives you His Holy Spirit.
521Th 4:9 About brotherly love: you don't need me to write you because you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
521Th 4:10 In fact, you are doing this toward all the brothers in the entire region of Macedonia. But we encourage you, brothers, to do so even more,
521Th 4:11 to seek to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,
521Th 4:12 so that you may walk properly in the presence of outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.
521Th 4:13 We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
521Th 4:14 Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, in the same way God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.
521Th 4:15 For we say this to you by a revelation from the Lord: We who are still alive at the Lord's coming will certainly have no advantage over those who have fallen asleep.
521Th 4:16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel's voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
521Th 4:17 Then we who are still alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will always be with the Lord.
521Th 4:18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
521Th 5:1 About the times and the seasons: brothers, you do not need anything to be written to you.
521Th 5:2 For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 When they say, "Peace and security," then sudden destruction comes on them, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
521Th 5:4 But you, brothers, are not in the dark, so that this day would overtake you like a thief.
521Th 5:5 For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We're not of the night or of darkness.
521Th 5:6 So then, we must not sleep, like the rest, but we must stay awake and be sober.
521Th 5:7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.
521Th 5:8 But since we are of the day, we must be sober and put the armor of faith and love on our chests, and put on a helmet of the hope of salvation.
521Th 5:9 For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
521Th 5:10 who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.
521Th 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up as you are already doing.
521Th 5:12 Now we ask you, brothers, to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the Lord and admonish you,
521Th 5:13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
521Th 5:14 And we exhort you, brothers: warn those who are lazy, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
521Th 5:15 See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all.
521Th 5:16 Rejoice always!
521Th 5:17 Pray constantly.
521Th 5:18 Give thanks in everything, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
521Th 5:19 Don't stifle the Spirit.
521Th 5:20 Don't despise prophecies,
521Th 5:21 but test all things. Hold on to what is good.
521Th 5:22 Stay away from every form of evil.
521Th 5:23 Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely. And may your spirit, soul, and body be kept sound and blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 5:24 He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.
521Th 5:25 Brothers, pray for us also.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
521Th 5:27 I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers.
521Th 5:28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you!
53
532Th 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 1:3 We must always thank God for you, brothers, which is fitting, since your faith is flourishing, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.
532Th 1:4 Therefore we ourselves boast about you among God's churches-- about your endurance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you endure.
532Th 1:5 It is a clear evidence of God's righteous judgment that you will be counted worthy of God's kingdom, for which you also are suffering,
532Th 1:6 since it is righteous for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
532Th 1:7 and [to reward] with rest you who are afflicted, along with us. [This will take place] at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with His powerful angels,
532Th 1:8 taking vengeance with flaming fire on those who don't know God and on those who don't obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 These will pay the penalty of everlasting destruction, away from the Lord's presence and from His glorious strength,
532Th 1:10 in that day when He comes to be glorified by His saints and to be admired by all those who have believed, because our testimony among you was believed.
532Th 1:11 And in view of this, we always pray for you that our God will consider you worthy of His calling, and will, by His power, fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith,
532Th 1:12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:1 Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to Him: we ask you, brothers,
532Th 2:2 not to be easily upset in mind or troubled, either by a spirit or by a message or by a letter as if from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has come.
532Th 2:3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any way. For [that day] will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.
532Th 2:4 He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in God's sanctuary, publicizing that he himself is God.
532Th 2:5 Don't you remember that when I was still with you I told you about this?
532Th 2:6 And you know what currently restrains [him], so that he will be revealed in his time.
532Th 2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; but the one now restraining will do so until he is out of the way,
532Th 2:8 and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of His mouth and will bring him to nothing with the brightness of His coming.
532Th 2:9 The coming [of the lawless one] is based on Satan's working, with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders,
532Th 2:10 and with every unrighteous deception among those who are perishing. [They perish] because they did not accept the love of the truth in order to be saved.
532Th 2:11 For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,
532Th 2:12 so that all will be condemned-- those who did not believe the truth but enjoyed unrighteousness.
532Th 2:13 But we must always thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God has chosen you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
532Th 2:14 He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:15 Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions you were taught, either by our message or by our letter.
532Th 2:16 May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace,
532Th 2:17 encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.
532Th 3:1 Finally, pray for us, brothers, that the Lord's message may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you,
532Th 3:2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not all have faith.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful; He will strengthen and guard you from the evil one.
532Th 3:4 We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do what we command.
532Th 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts to God's love and Christ's endurance.
532Th 3:6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother who walks irresponsibly and not according to the tradition received from us.
532Th 3:7 For you yourselves know how you must imitate us: we were not irresponsible among you;
532Th 3:8 we did not eat anyone's bread free of charge; instead, we labored and toiled, working night and day, so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
532Th 3:9 It is not that we don't have the right [to support], but we did it to make ourselves an example to you so that you would imitate us.
532Th 3:10 In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: "If anyone isn't willing to work, he should not eat."
532Th 3:11 For we hear that there are some among you who walk irresponsibly, not working at all, but interfering with the work [of others].
532Th 3:12 Now we command and exhort such people, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that quietly working, they may eat their own bread.
532Th 3:13 Brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.
532Th 3:14 And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don't associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
532Th 3:15 Yet don't treat him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
532Th 3:16 May the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
532Th 3:17 This greeting is in my own hand-- Paul. This is a sign in every letter; this is how I write.
532Th 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.
54
541Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope:
541Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
541Tm 1:3 As I urged you when I went to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach other doctrine
541Tm 1:4 or to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These promote empty speculations rather than God's plan, which operates by faith.
541Tm 1:5 Now the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
541Tm 1:6 Some have deviated from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion.
541Tm 1:7 They want to be teachers of the law, although they don't understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on.
541Tm 1:8 Now we know that the law is good, provided one uses it legitimately.
541Tm 1:9 We know that the law is not meant for a righteous person, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers,
541Tm 1:10 for the sexually immoral and homosexuals, for kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching
541Tm 1:11 based on the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me.
541Tm 1:12 I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to the ministry--
541Tm 1:13 one who was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man. Since it was out of ignorance that I had acted in unbelief, I received mercy,
541Tm 1:14 and the grace of our Lord overflowed, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners"-- and I am the worst of them.
541Tm 1:16 But I received mercy because of this, so that in me, the worst [of them], Christ Jesus might demonstrate the utmost patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
541Tm 1:18 Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies previously made about you, so that by them you may strongly engage in battle,
541Tm 1:19 having faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and have suffered the shipwreck of their faith.
541Tm 1:20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them, and I have delivered them to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
541Tm 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone,
541Tm 2:2 for kings and all those who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
541Tm 2:3 This is good, and it pleases God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
541Tm 2:5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and man, a man, Christ Jesus,
541Tm 2:6 who gave Himself-- a ransom for all, a testimony at the proper time.
541Tm 2:7 For this I was appointed a herald, an apostle (I am telling the truth; I am not lying), and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
541Tm 2:8 Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument.
541Tm 2:9 Also, the women are to dress themselves in modest clothing, with decency and good sense; not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive apparel,
541Tm 2:10 but with good works, as is proper for women who affirm that they worship God.
541Tm 2:11 A woman should learn in silence with full submission.
541Tm 2:12 I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to be silent.
541Tm 2:13 For Adam was created first, then Eve.
541Tm 2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and transgressed.
541Tm 2:15 But she will be saved through childbearing, if she continues in faith, love, and holiness, with good sense.
541Tm 3:1 This saying is trustworthy: "If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work."
541Tm 3:2 An overseer, therefore, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an able teacher,
541Tm 3:3 not addicted to wine, not a bully but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy--
541Tm 3:4 one who manages his own household competently, having his children under control with all dignity.
541Tm 3:5 (If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God's church?)
541Tm 3:6 He must not be a new convert, or he might become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
541Tm 3:7 Furthermore, he must have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the Devil's trap.
541Tm 3:8 Deacons, likewise, should be worthy of respect, not hypocritical, not drinking a lot of wine, not greedy for money,
541Tm 3:9 holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
541Tm 3:10 And they must also be tested first; if they prove blameless, then they can serve as deacons.
541Tm 3:11 Wives, too, must be worthy of respect, not slanderers, self-controlled, faithful in everything.
541Tm 3:12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households competently.
541Tm 3:13 For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 I write these things to you, hoping to come to you soon.
541Tm 3:15 But if I should be delayed, [I have written] so that you will know how people ought to act in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 And most certainly, the mystery of godliness is great: He was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
541Tm 4:1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons,
541Tm 4:2 through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared.
541Tm 4:3 They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods that God created to be received with gratitude by those who believe and know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
541Tm 4:5 since it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
541Tm 4:6 If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
541Tm 4:7 But have nothing to do with irreverent and silly myths. Rather, train yourself in godliness,
541Tm 4:8 for, the training of the body has a limited benefit, but godliness is beneficial in every way, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
541Tm 4:9 This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
541Tm 4:10 In fact, we labor and strive for this, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, especially of those who believe.
541Tm 4:11 Command and teach these things.
541Tm 4:12 No one should despise your youth; instead, you should be an example to the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
541Tm 4:13 Until I come, give your attention to public reading, exhortation, and teaching.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you; it was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.
541Tm 4:15 Practice these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
541Tm 4:16 Be conscientious about yourself and your teaching; persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.
541Tm 5:1 Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,
541Tm 5:2 older women as mothers, and with all propriety, the younger women as sisters.
541Tm 5:3 Support widows who are genuinely widows.
541Tm 5:4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to practice their religion toward their own family first and to repay their parents, for this pleases God.
541Tm 5:5 The real widow, left all alone, has put her hope in God and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers;
541Tm 5:6 however, she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.
541Tm 5:7 Command this, so that they won't be blamed.
541Tm 5:8 Now if anyone does not provide for his own relatives, and especially for his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
541Tm 5:9 No widow should be placed on the official support list unless she is at least 60 years old, has been the wife of one husband,
541Tm 5:10 and is well known for good works-- that is, if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the saints' feet, helped the afflicted, and devoted herself to every good work.
541Tm 5:11 But refuse to enroll younger widows; for when they are drawn away from Christ by desire, they want to marry,
541Tm 5:12 and will therefore receive condemnation because they have renounced their original pledge.
541Tm 5:13 At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house; they are not only idle, but are also gossips and busybodies, saying things they shouldn't say.
541Tm 5:14 Therefore, I want younger women to marry, have children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us.
541Tm 5:15 For some have already turned away to follow Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If any believing woman has widows, she should help them, and the church should not be burdened, so that it can help those who are genuinely widows.
541Tm 5:17 The elders who are good leaders should be considered worthy of an ample honorarium, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says: You must not muzzle an ox that is threshing grain, and, The laborer is worthy of his wages.
541Tm 5:19 Don't accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.
541Tm 5:20 Publicly rebuke those who sin, so that the rest will also be afraid.
541Tm 5:21 I solemnly charge you, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism.
541Tm 5:22 Don't be too quick to lay hands on anyone, and don't share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
541Tm 5:23 Don't continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
541Tm 5:24 Some people's sins are evident, going before them to judgment, but [the sins] of others follow them.
541Tm 5:25 Likewise, good works are obvious, and those that are not [obvious] cannot remain hidden.
541Tm 6:1 All who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters to be worthy of all respect, so that God's name and His teaching will not be blasphemed.
541Tm 6:2 And those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers, but should serve them better, since those who benefit from their service are believers and dearly loved. Teach and encourage these things.
541Tm 6:3 If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not agree with the sound teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the teaching that promotes godliness,
541Tm 6:4 he is conceited, understanding nothing, but having a sick interest in disputes and arguments over words. From these come envy, quarreling, slanders, evil suspicions,
541Tm 6:5 and constant disagreement among men whose minds are depraved and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a way to material gain.
541Tm 6:6 But godliness with contentment is a great gain.
541Tm 6:7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out.
541Tm 6:8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.
541Tm 6:9 But those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains.
541Tm 6:11 Now you, man of God, run from these things; but pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight for the faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called and have made a good confession before many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 In the presence of God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave a good confession before Pontius Pilate, I charge you
541Tm 6:14 to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
541Tm 6:15 which God will bring about in His own time. [He is] the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords,
541Tm 6:16 the only One who has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom none of mankind has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal might. Amen.
541Tm 6:17 Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of wealth, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.
541Tm 6:18 [Instruct them] to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share,
541Tm 6:19 storing up for themselves a good foundation for the age to come, so that they may take hold of life that is real.
541Tm 6:20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding irreverent, empty speech and contradictions from the "knowledge" that falsely bears that name.
541Tm 6:21 By professing it, some people have deviated from the faith. Grace be with all of you.
55
552Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, for the promise of life in Christ Jesus:
552Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my dearly loved child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
552Tm 1:3 I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my forefathers did, when I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day.
552Tm 1:4 Remembering your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy,
552Tm 1:5 clearly recalling your sincere faith that first lived in your grandmother Lois, then in your mother Eunice, and that I am convinced is in you also.
552Tm 1:6 Therefore, I remind you to keep ablaze the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.
552Tm 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgment.
552Tm 1:8 So don't be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me His prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God,
552Tm 1:9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.
552Tm 1:10 This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
552Tm 1:11 For this [gospel] I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher,
552Tm 1:12 and that is why I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.
552Tm 1:13 Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 Guard, through the Holy Spirit who lives in us, that good thing entrusted to you.
552Tm 1:15 This you know: all those in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
552Tm 1:17 On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me.
552Tm 1:18 May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy from the Lord on that day. And you know how much he ministered at Ephesus.
552Tm 2:1 You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:2 And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
552Tm 2:3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 To please the recruiter, no one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of everyday life.
552Tm 2:5 Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
552Tm 2:6 It is the hardworking farmer who ought to be the first to get a share of the crops.
552Tm 2:7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
552Tm 2:8 Keep in mind Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, according to my gospel.
552Tm 2:9 For this I suffer, to the point of being bound like a criminal; but God's message is not bound.
552Tm 2:10 This is why I endure all things for the elect: so that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
552Tm 2:11 This saying is trustworthy: For if we have died with Him, we will also live with Him;
552Tm 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;
552Tm 2:13 if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
552Tm 2:14 Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to fight about words; this is in no way profitable and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
552Tm 2:15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.
552Tm 2:16 But avoid irreverent, empty speech, for this will produce an even greater measure of godlessness.
552Tm 2:17 And their word will spread like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
552Tm 2:18 They have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and are overturning the faith of some.
552Tm 2:19 Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, having this inscription: The Lord knows those who are His, and Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from unrighteousness.
552Tm 2:20 Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver bowls, but also those of wood and earthenware, some for special use, some for ordinary.
552Tm 2:21 So if anyone purifies himself from these things, he will be a special instrument, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
552Tm 2:22 Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
552Tm 2:23 But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
552Tm 2:24 The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient,
552Tm 2:25 instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance to know the truth.
552Tm 2:26 Then they may come to their senses and escape the Devil's trap, having been captured by him to do his will.
552Tm 3:1 But know this: difficult times will come in the last days.
552Tm 3:2 For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
552Tm 3:3 unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, without love for what is good,
552Tm 3:4 traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
552Tm 3:5 holding to the form of religion but denying its power. Avoid these people!
552Tm 3:6 For among them are those who worm their way into households and capture idle women burdened down with sins, led along by a variety of passions,
552Tm 3:7 always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
552Tm 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men who are corrupt in mind, worthless in regard to the faith.
552Tm 3:9 But they will not make further progress, for their lack of understanding will be clear to all, as theirs was also.
552Tm 3:10 But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, and endurance,
552Tm 3:11 along with the persecutions and sufferings that came to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from them all.
552Tm 3:12 In fact, all those who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
552Tm 3:13 Evil people and imposters will become worse, deceiving and being deceived.
552Tm 3:14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing those from whom you learned,
552Tm 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness,
552Tm 3:17 so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
552Tm 4:1 Before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom, I solemnly charge you:
552Tm 4:2 proclaim the message; persist in it whether convenient or not; rebuke, correct, and encourage with great patience and teaching.
552Tm 4:3 For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will accumulate teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear something new.
552Tm 4:4 They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths.
552Tm 4:5 But as for you, keep a clear head about everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
552Tm 4:6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time for my departure is close.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
552Tm 4:8 In the future, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me, but to all those who have loved His appearing.
552Tm 4:9 Make every effort to come to me soon,
552Tm 4:10 for Demas has deserted me, because he loved this present world, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you, for he is useful to me in the ministry.
552Tm 4:12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
552Tm 4:13 When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus, as well as the scrolls, especially the parchments.
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works.
552Tm 4:15 Watch out for him yourself, because he strongly opposed our words.
552Tm 4:16 At my first defense, no one came to my assistance, but everyone deserted me. May it not be counted against them.
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the proclamation might be fully made through me, and all the Gentiles might hear. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
552Tm 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus has remained at Corinth; Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.
552Tm 4:21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
552Tm 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you!
56
56Ti 1:1 Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,
56Ti 1:2 in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began,
56Ti 1:3 and has in His own time revealed His message in the proclamation that I was entrusted with by the command of God our Savior:
56Ti 1:4 To Titus, my true child in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56Ti 1:5 The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town:
56Ti 1:6 someone who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of wildness or rebellion.
56Ti 1:7 For an overseer, as God's manager, must be blameless, not arrogant, not quick tempered, not addicted to wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,
56Ti 1:8 but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled,
56Ti 1:9 holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it.
56Ti 1:10 For there are also many rebellious people, idle talkers and deceivers, especially those from Judaism.
56Ti 1:11 It is necessary to silence them; they overthrow whole households by teaching for dishonest gain what they should not.
56Ti 1:12 One of their very own prophets said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
56Ti 1:13 This testimony is true. So, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith
56Ti 1:14 and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commandments of men who reject the truth.
56Ti 1:15 To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled.
56Ti 1:16 They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good work.
56Ti 2:1 But you must speak what is consistent with sound teaching.
56Ti 2:2 Older men are to be self-controlled, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance.
56Ti 2:3 In the same way, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to much wine. [They are] to teach what is good,
56Ti 2:4 so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and children,
56Ti 2:5 to be sensible, pure, good homemakers, and submissive to their husbands, so that God's message will not be slandered.
56Ti 2:6 Likewise, encourage the young men to be sensible
56Ti 2:7 about everything. Set an example of good works yourself, with integrity and dignity in your teaching.
56Ti 2:8 Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.
56Ti 2:9 Slaves are to be submissive to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back
56Ti 2:10 or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything.
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, with salvation for all people,
56Ti 2:12 instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age,
56Ti 2:13 while we wait for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
56Ti 2:14 He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a special people, eager to do good works.
56Ti 2:15 Say these things, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
56Ti 3:1 Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,
56Ti 3:2 to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people.
56Ti 3:3 For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, captives of various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.
56Ti 3:4 But when the goodness and love for man appeared from God our Savior,
56Ti 3:5 He saved us-- not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
56Ti 3:6 This [Spirit] He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56Ti 3:7 so that having been justified by His grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.
56Ti 3:8 This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone.
56Ti 3:9 But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
56Ti 3:10 Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,
56Ti 3:11 knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.
56Ti 3:12 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56Ti 3:13 Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing.
56Ti 3:14 And our people must also learn to devote themselves to good works for cases of urgent need, so that they will not be unfruitful.
56Ti 3:15 All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
57
57Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother: To Philemon, our dear friend and co-worker,
57Phm 1:2 to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.
57Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57Phm 1:4 I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,
57Phm 1:5 because I hear of your love and faith toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.
57Phm 1:6 [I pray] that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us for [the glory of] Christ.
57Phm 1:7 For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
57Phm 1:8 For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right,
57Phm 1:9 I appeal, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
57Phm 1:10 appeal to you for my child, whom I fathered while in chains-- Onesimus.
57Phm 1:11 Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful to both you and me.
57Phm 1:12 I am sending him-- a part of myself-- back to you.
57Phm 1:13 I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place.
57Phm 1:14 But I didn't want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will.
57Phm 1:15 For perhaps this is why he was separated [from you] for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently,
57Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave-- as a dearly loved brother. This is especially so to me, but even more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
57Phm 1:17 So if you consider me a partner, accept him as you would me.
57Phm 1:18 And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
57Phm 1:19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it-- not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self.
57Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
57Phm 1:21 Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
57Phm 1:22 But meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, and so do
57Phm 1:24 Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my co-workers.
57Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
58
58Heb 1:1 Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways.
58Heb 1:2 In these last days, He has spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things and through whom He made the universe.
58Heb 1:3 He is the radiance of His glory, the exact expression of His nature, and He sustains all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
58Heb 1:4 So He became higher in rank than the angels, just as the name He inherited is superior to theirs.
58Heb 1:5 For to which of the angels did He ever say, You are My Son; today I have become Your Father, or again, I will be His Father, and He will be My Son?
58Heb 1:6 When He again brings His firstborn into the world, He says, And all God's angels must worship Him.
58Heb 1:7 And about the angels He says: He makes His angels winds, and His servants a fiery flame;
58Heb 1:8 but about the Son: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
58Heb 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; this is why God, Your God, has anointed You, rather than Your companions, with the oil of joy.
58Heb 1:10 And: In the beginning, Lord, You established the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands;
58Heb 1:11 they will perish, but You remain. They will all wear out like clothing;
58Heb 1:12 You will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like a robe. But You are the same, and Your years will never end.
58Heb 1:13 Now to which of the angels has He ever said: Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?
58Heb 1:14 Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?
58Heb 2:1 We must therefore pay even more attention to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away.
58Heb 2:2 For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,
58Heb 2:3 how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him.
58Heb 2:4 At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles, and distributions [of gifts] from the Holy Spirit according to His will.
58Heb 2:5 For He has not subjected to angels the world to come that we are talking about.
58Heb 2:6 But one has somewhere testified: What is man, that You remember him, or the son of man, that You care for him?
58Heb 2:7 You made him lower than the angels for a short time; You crowned him with glory and honor
58Heb 2:8 and subjected everything under his feet. For in subjecting everything to him, He left nothing not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see everything subjected to him.
58Heb 2:9 But we do see Jesus-- made lower than the angels for a short time so that by God's grace He might taste death for everyone-- crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death.
58Heb 2:10 For it was fitting, in bringing many sons to glory, that He, for whom and through whom all things exist, should make the source of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
58Heb 2:11 For the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. That is why He is not ashamed to call them brothers,
58Heb 2:12 saying: I will proclaim Your name to My brothers; I will sing hymns to You in the congregation.
58Heb 2:13 Again, I will trust in Him. And again, Here I am with the children God gave Me.
58Heb 2:14 Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, He also shared in these, so that through His death He might destroy the one holding the power of death-- that is, the Devil--
58Heb 2:15 and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death.
58Heb 2:16 For it is clear that He does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham's offspring.
58Heb 2:17 Therefore He had to be like His brothers in every way, so that He could become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
58Heb 2:18 For since He Himself was tested and has suffered, He is able to help those who are tested.
58Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brothers and companions in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession;
58Heb 3:2 He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was in all God's household.
58Heb 3:3 For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house.
58Heb 3:4 Now every house is built by someone, but the One who built everything is God.
58Heb 3:5 Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's household, as a testimony to what would be said [in the future].
58Heb 3:6 But Christ was faithful as a Son over His household, whose household we are if we hold on to the courage and the confidence of our hope.
58Heb 3:7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you hear His voice,
58Heb 3:8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the desert,
58Heb 3:9 where your fathers tested Me, tried [ Me], and saw My works
58Heb 3:10 for 40 years. Therefore I was provoked with this generation and said, "They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways."
58Heb 3:11 So I swore in My anger, "They will not enter My rest."
58Heb 3:12 Watch out, brothers, so that there won't be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that departs from the living God.
58Heb 3:13 But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today, so that none of you is hardened by sin's deception.
58Heb 3:14 For we have become companions of the Messiah if we hold firmly until the end the reality that we had at the start.
58Heb 3:15 As it is said: Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.
58Heb 3:16 For who heard and rebelled? Wasn't it really all who came out of Egypt under Moses?
58Heb 3:17 And with whom was He "provoked for 40 years"? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
58Heb 3:18 And to whom did He "swear that they would not enter His rest," if not those who disobeyed?
58Heb 3:19 So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
58Heb 4:1 Therefore, while the promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear so that none of you should miss it.
58Heb 4:2 For we also have received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith
58Heb 4:3 (for we who have believed enter the rest), in keeping with what He has said: So I swore in My anger, they will not enter My rest. And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world,
58Heb 4:4 for somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this way: And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.
58Heb 4:5 Again, in that passage [He says], They will never enter My rest.
58Heb 4:6 Since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience,
58Heb 4:7 again, He specifies a certain day-- today-- speaking through David after such a long time, as previously stated: Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.
58Heb 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken later about another day.
58Heb 4:9 A Sabbath rest remains, therefore, for God's people.
58Heb 4:10 For the person who has entered His rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from His.
58Heb 4:11 Let us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating as far as to divide soul, spirit, joints, and marrow; it is a judge of the ideas and thoughts of the heart.
58Heb 4:13 No creature is hidden from Him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account.
58Heb 4:14 Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens-- Jesus the Son of God-- let us hold fast to the confession.
58Heb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin.
58Heb 4:16 Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time.
58Heb 5:1 For every high priest taken from men is appointed in service to God for the people, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58Heb 5:2 He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness.
58Heb 5:3 Because of this, he must make a sin offering for himself as well as for the people.
58Heb 5:4 No one takes this honor on himself; instead, a person is called by God, just as Aaron was.
58Heb 5:5 In the same way, the Messiah did not exalt Himself to become a high priest, but the One who said to Him, You are My Son; today I have become Your Father,
58Heb 5:6 also said in another passage, You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 5:7 During His earthly life, He offered prayers and appeals, with loud cries and tears, to the One who was able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence.
58Heb 5:8 Though a Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered.
58Heb 5:9 After He was perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,
58Heb 5:10 and He was declared by God a high priest "in the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 5:11 We have a great deal to say about this, and it's difficult to explain, since you have become slow to understand.
58Heb 5:12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of God's revelation. You need milk, not solid food.
58Heb 5:13 Now everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness, because he is an infant.
58Heb 5:14 But solid food is for the mature-- for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil.
58Heb 6:1 Therefore, leaving the elementary message about the Messiah, let us go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God,
58Heb 6:2 teaching about ritual washings, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And we will do this if God permits.
58Heb 6:4 For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, became companions with the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 tasted God's good word and the powers of the coming age,
58Heb 6:6 and who have fallen away, because, to their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding Him up to contempt.
58Heb 6:7 For ground that has drunk the rain that has often fallen on it, and that produces vegetation useful to those it is cultivated for, receives a blessing from God.
58Heb 6:8 But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and about to be cursed, and will be burned at the end.
58Heb 6:9 Even though we are speaking this way, dear friends, in your case we are confident of the better things connected with salvation.
58Heb 6:10 For God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you showed for His name when you served the saints-- and you continue to serve them.
58Heb 6:11 Now we want each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the final realization of your hope,
58Heb 6:12 so that you won't become lazy, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance.
58Heb 6:13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself:
58Heb 6:14 I will most certainly bless you, and I will greatly multiply you.
58Heb 6:15 And so, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained the promise.
58Heb 6:16 For men swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute.
58Heb 6:17 Because God wanted to show His unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, He guaranteed it with an oath,
58Heb 6:18 so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.
58Heb 6:19 We have this [hope]-- like a sure and firm anchor of the soul-- that enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.
58Heb 6:20 Jesus has entered there on our behalf as a forerunner, because He has become a "high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 7:1 For this Melchizedek-- King of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham and blessed him as he returned from defeating the kings,
58Heb 7:2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything; first, his name means "king of righteousness," then also, "king of Salem," meaning "king of peace";
58Heb 7:3 without father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God-- remains a priest forever.
58Heb 7:4 Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the plunder!
58Heb 7:5 The sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment according to the law to collect a tenth from the people-- that is, from their brothers-- though they have [also] descended from Abraham.
58Heb 7:6 But one without this lineage collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
58Heb 7:7 Without a doubt, the inferior is blessed by the superior.
58Heb 7:8 In the one case, men who will die receive tithes; but in the other case, [Scripture] testifies that he lives.
58Heb 7:9 And in a sense Levi himself, who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham,
58Heb 7:10 for he was still within his forefather when Melchizedek met him.
58Heb 7:11 If, then, perfection came through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise in the order of Melchizedek, and not to be described as being in the order of Aaron?
58Heb 7:12 For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must be a change of law as well.
58Heb 7:13 For the One about whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has served at the altar.
58Heb 7:14 Now it is evident that our Lord came from Judah, and about that tribe Moses said nothing concerning priests.
58Heb 7:15 And this becomes clearer if another priest like Melchizedek arises,
58Heb 7:16 who doesn't become a [priest] based on a legal command concerning physical descent but based on the power of an indestructible life.
58Heb 7:17 For it has been testified: You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 7:18 So the previous commandment is annulled because it was weak and unprofitable
58Heb 7:19 (for the law perfected nothing), but a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
58Heb 7:20 None of this [happened] without an oath. For others became priests without an oath,
58Heb 7:21 but He with an oath made by the One who said to Him: The Lord has sworn, and He will not change His mind, You are a priest forever.
58Heb 7:22 So Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.
58Heb 7:23 Now many have become [Levitical] priests, since they are prevented by death from remaining in office.
58Heb 7:24 But because He remains forever, He holds His priesthood permanently.
58Heb 7:25 Therefore He is always able to save those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.
58Heb 7:26 For this is the kind of high priest we need: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
58Heb 7:27 He doesn't need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do-- first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all when He offered Himself.
58Heb 7:28 For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promise of the oath, which came after the law, [appoints] a Son, who has been perfected forever.
58Heb 8:1 Now the main point of what is being said is this: we have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
58Heb 8:2 a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, and not man.
58Heb 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore it was necessary for this [priest] also to have something to offer.
58Heb 8:4 Now if He were on earth, He wouldn't be a priest, since there are those offering the gifts prescribed by the law.
58Heb 8:5 These serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle. For He said, Be careful that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.
58Heb 8:6 But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree He is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been legally enacted on better promises.
58Heb 8:7 For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, no opportunity would have been sought for a second one.
58Heb 8:8 But finding fault with His people, He says: "Look, the days are coming," says the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--
58Heb 8:9 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not continue in My covenant, I disregarded them," says the Lord.
58Heb 8:10 "But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days," says the Lord: "I will put My laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
58Heb 8:11 And each person will not teach his fellow citizen, and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them.
58Heb 8:12 For I will be merciful to their wrongdoing, and I will never again remember their sins."
58Heb 8:13 By saying, a new [ covenant], He has declared that the first is old. And what is old and aging is about to disappear.
58Heb 9:1 Now the first [covenant] also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary.
58Heb 9:2 For a tabernacle was set up; and in the first room, which is called "the holy place," were the lampstand, the table, and the presentation loaves.
58Heb 9:3 Behind the second curtain, the tabernacle was called "the holy of holies."
58Heb 9:4 It contained the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, covered with gold on all sides, in which there was a gold jar containing the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 The cherubim of glory were above it overshadowing the mercy seat. It is not possible to speak about these things in detail right now.
58Heb 9:6 These things having been set up this way, the priests enter the first room repeatedly, performing their ministry.
58Heb 9:7 But the high priest alone enters the second room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.
58Heb 9:8 The Holy Spirit was making it clear that the way into the holy of holies had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing.
58Heb 9:9 This is a symbol for the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the worshiper's conscience.
58Heb 9:10 They are physical regulations and only deal with food, drink, and various washings imposed until the time of restoration.
58Heb 9:11 Now the Messiah has appeared, high priest of the good things that have come. In the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands (that is, not of this creation),
58Heb 9:12 He entered the holy of holies once for all, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
58Heb 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,
58Heb 9:14 how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?
58Heb 9:15 Therefore He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions [committed] under the first covenant.
58Heb 9:16 Where a will exists, the death of the testator must be established.
58Heb 9:17 For a will is valid only when people die, since it is never in force while the testator is living.
58Heb 9:18 That is why even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood.
58Heb 9:19 For when every commandment had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll itself and all the people,
58Heb 9:20 saying, This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.
58Heb 9:21 In the same way, he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of worship with blood.
58Heb 9:22 According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58Heb 9:23 Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be purified with these [sacrifices], but the heavenly things themselves [to be purified] with better sacrifices than these.
58Heb 9:24 For the Messiah did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model of the true one) but into heaven itself, that He might now appear in the presence of God for us.
58Heb 9:25 He did not do this to offer Himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another.
58Heb 9:26 Otherwise, He would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
58Heb 9:27 And just as it is appointed for people to die once-- and after this, judgment--
58Heb 9:28 so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.
58Heb 10:1 Since the law has [only] a shadow of the good things to come, and not the actual form of those realities, it can never perfect the worshipers by the same sacrifices they continually offer year after year.
58Heb 10:2 Otherwise, wouldn't they have stopped being offered, since the worshipers, once purified, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
58Heb 10:3 But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
58Heb 10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58Heb 10:5 Therefore, as He was coming into the world, He said: You did not want sacrifice and offering, but You prepared a body for Me.
58Heb 10:6 You did not delight in whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, "See, I have come-- it is written about Me in the volume of the scroll-- to do Your will, O God!"
58Heb 10:8 After He says above, You did not desire or delight in sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings and sin offerings, (which are offered according to the law),
58Heb 10:9 He then says, See, I have come to do Your will. He takes away the first to establish the second.
58Heb 10:10 By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.
58Heb 10:11 Now every priest stands day after day ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58Heb 10:12 But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.
58Heb 10:13 He is now waiting until His enemies are made His footstool.
58Heb 10:14 For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
58Heb 10:15 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after He had said:
58Heb 10:16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws on their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,
58Heb 10:17 [He adds]: I will never again remember their sins and their lawless acts.
58Heb 10:18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
58Heb 10:19 Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus,
58Heb 10:20 by the new and living way that He has inaugurated for us, through the curtain (that is, His flesh);
58Heb 10:21 and since we have a great high priest over the house of God,
58Heb 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled [clean] from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.
58Heb 10:24 And let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works,
58Heb 10:25 not staying away from our meetings, as some habitually do, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
58Heb 10:26 For if we deliberately sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
58Heb 10:27 but a terrifying expectation of judgment, and the fury of a fire about to consume the adversaries.
58Heb 10:28 If anyone disregards Moses' law, he dies without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58Heb 10:29 How much worse punishment, do you think one will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God, regarded as profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and insulted the Spirit of grace?
58Heb 10:30 For we know the One who has said, Vengeance belongs to Me, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge His people.
58Heb 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!
58Heb 10:32 Remember the earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings.
58Heb 10:33 Sometimes you were publicly exposed to taunts and afflictions, and at other times you were companions of those who were treated that way.
58Heb 10:34 For you sympathized with the prisoners and accepted with joy the confiscation of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves have a better and enduring possession.
58Heb 10:35 So don't throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
58Heb 10:36 For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will, you may receive what was promised.
58Heb 10:37 For in yet a very little while, the Coming One will come and not delay.
58Heb 10:38 But My righteous one will live by faith; and if he draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.
58Heb 10:39 But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life.
58Heb 11:1 Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen.
58Heb 11:2 For by it our ancestors were approved.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen has been made from things that are not visible.
58Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain [did]. By this he was approved as a righteous man, because God approved his gifts, and even though he is dead, he still speaks through this.
58Heb 11:5 By faith, Enoch was taken away so that he did not experience death, and he was not to be found because God took him away. For prior to his transformation he was approved, having pleased God.
58Heb 11:6 Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who draws near to Him must believe that He exists and rewards those who seek Him.
58Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, after being warned about what was not yet seen, in reverence built an ark to deliver his family. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
58Heb 11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and went out to a place he was going to receive as an inheritance; he went out, not knowing where he was going.
58Heb 11:9 By faith he stayed as a foreigner in the land of promise, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise.
58Heb 11:10 For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58Heb 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself, when she was barren, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she considered that the One who had promised was faithful.
58Heb 11:12 And therefore from one man-- in fact, from one as good as dead-- came offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as innumerable as the grains of sand by the seashore.
58Heb 11:13 These all died in faith without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on the earth.
58Heb 11:14 Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
58Heb 11:15 If they had been remembering that land they came from, they would have had opportunity to return.
58Heb 11:16 But they now aspire to a better land-- a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
58Heb 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac; he who had received the promises was offering up his unique son,
58Heb 11:18 about whom it had been said, In Isaac your seed will be called.
58Heb 11:19 He considered God to be able even to raise someone from the dead, from which he also got him back as an illustration.
58Heb 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
58Heb 11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and, he worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
58Heb 11:22 By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions concerning his bones.
58Heb 11:23 By faith Moses, after he was born, was hidden by his parents for three months, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they didn't fear the king's edict.
58Heb 11:24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
58Heb 11:25 and chose to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the short-lived pleasure of sin.
58Heb 11:26 For he considered reproach for the sake of the Messiah to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, since his attention was on the reward.
58Heb 11:27 By faith he left Egypt behind, not being afraid of the king's anger, for he persevered, as one who sees Him who is invisible.
58Heb 11:28 By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.
58Heb 11:29 By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned.
58Heb 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being encircled for seven days.
58Heb 11:31 By faith Rahab the prostitute received the spies in peace and didn't perish with those who disobeyed.
58Heb 11:32 And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
58Heb 11:33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 quenched the raging of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength after being weak, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight.
58Heb 11:35 Women received their dead raised to life again. Some men were tortured, not accepting release, so that they might gain a better resurrection,
58Heb 11:36 and others experienced mockings and scourgings, as well as bonds and imprisonment.
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, and mistreated.
58Heb 11:38 The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.
58Heb 11:39 All these were approved through their faith, but they did not receive what was promised,
58Heb 11:40 since God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.
58Heb 12:1 Therefore since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us, and run with endurance the race that lies before us,
58Heb 12:2 keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that lay before Him endured a cross and despised the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of God's throne.
58Heb 12:3 For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, so that you won't grow weary and lose heart.
58Heb 12:4 In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58Heb 12:5 And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: My son, do not take the Lord's discipline lightly, or faint when you are reproved by Him;
58Heb 12:6 for the Lord disciplines the one He loves, and punishes every son whom He receives.
58Heb 12:7 Endure it as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?
58Heb 12:8 But if you are without discipline-- which all receive-- then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
58Heb 12:9 Furthermore, we had natural fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn't we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live?
58Heb 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but He does it for our benefit, so that we can share His holiness.
58Heb 12:11 No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the fruit of peace and righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
58Heb 12:12 Therefore strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees,
58Heb 12:13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but healed instead.
58Heb 12:14 Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness-- without it no one will see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up, causing trouble and by it, defiling many.
58Heb 12:16 And see that there isn't any immoral or irreverent person like Esau, who sold his birthright in exchange for one meal.
58Heb 12:17 For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he didn't find any opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears.
58Heb 12:18 For you have not come to what could be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, gloom, and storm,
58Heb 12:19 to the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of words. (Those who heard it begged that not another word be spoken to them,
58Heb 12:20 for they could not bear what was commanded: And if even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned!
58Heb 12:21 And the appearance was so terrifying that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling.)
58Heb 12:22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God (the heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of angels in festive gathering,
58Heb 12:23 to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to God who is the judge of all, to the spirits of righteous people made perfect,
58Heb 12:24 to Jesus (mediator of a new covenant), and to the sprinkled blood, which says better things than the [blood] of Abel.
58Heb 12:25 See that you do not reject the One who speaks; for if they did not escape when they rejected Him who warned them on earth, even less will we if we turn away from Him who warns us from heaven.
58Heb 12:26 His voice shook the earth at that time, but now He has promised, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.
58Heb 12:27 Now this expression, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of what can be shaken-- that is, created things-- so that what is not shaken might remain.
58Heb 12:28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us hold on to grace. By it, we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe;
58Heb 12:29 for our God is a consuming fire.
58Heb 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.
58Heb 13:2 Don't neglect to show hospitality, for by doing this some have welcomed angels as guests without knowing it.
58Heb 13:3 Remember the prisoners, as though you were in prison with them, and the mistreated, as though you yourselves were suffering bodily.
58Heb 13:4 Marriage must be respected by all, and the marriage bed kept undefiled, because God will judge immoral people and adulterers.
58Heb 13:5 Your life should be free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for He Himself has said, I will never leave you or forsake you.
58Heb 13:6 Therefore, we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
58Heb 13:7 Remember your leaders who have spoken God's word to you. As you carefully observe the outcome of their lives, imitate their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
58Heb 13:9 Don't be led astray by various kinds of strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established by grace and not by foods, since those involved in them have not benefited.
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle do not have a right to eat.
58Heb 13:11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy of holies by the high priest as a sin offering are burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, so that He might sanctify the people by His own blood.
58Heb 13:13 Let us then go to Him outside the camp, bearing His disgrace.
58Heb 13:14 For here we do not have an enduring city; instead, we seek the one to come.
58Heb 13:15 Therefore, through Him let us continually offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that confess His name.
58Heb 13:16 Don't neglect to do good and to share, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.
58Heb 13:17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us; for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience, wanting to conduct ourselves honorably in everything.
58Heb 13:19 And I especially urge you to pray that I may be restored to you very soon.
58Heb 13:20 Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus-- the great Shepherd of the sheep-- with the blood of the everlasting covenant,
58Heb 13:21 equip you with all that is good to do His will, working in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
58Heb 13:22 Brothers, I urge you to receive this word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
58Heb 13:23 Be aware that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon enough, he will be with me when I see you.
58Heb 13:24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you.
58Heb 13:25 Grace be with all of you.
59
59Jms 1:1 James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ: To the 12 tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings.
59Jms 1:2 Consider it a great joy, my brothers, whenever you experience various trials,
59Jms 1:3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
59Jms 1:4 But endurance must do its complete work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
59Jms 1:5 Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him.
59Jms 1:6 But let him ask in faith without doubting. For the doubter is like the surging sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59Jms 1:8 An indecisive man is unstable in all his ways.
59Jms 1:9 The brother of humble circumstances should boast in his exaltation;
59Jms 1:10 but the one who is rich [should boast] in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a flower of the field.
59Jms 1:11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will wither away while pursuing his activities.
59Jms 1:12 Blessed is a man who endures trials, because when he passes the test he will receive the crown of life that He has promised to those who love Him.
59Jms 1:13 No one undergoing a trial should say, "I am being tempted by God." For God is not tempted by evil, and He Himself doesn't tempt anyone.
59Jms 1:14 But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires.
59Jms 1:15 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.
59Jms 1:16 Don't be deceived, my dearly loved brothers.
59Jms 1:17 Every generous act and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights; with Him there is no variation or shadow cast by turning.
59Jms 1:18 By His own choice, He gave us a new birth by the message of truth so that we would be the firstfruits of His creatures.
59Jms 1:19 My dearly loved brothers, understand this: everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,
59Jms 1:20 for man's anger does not accomplish God's righteousness.
59Jms 1:21 Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and evil excess, humbly receive the implanted word, which is able to save you.
59Jms 1:22 But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
59Jms 1:23 Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror;
59Jms 1:24 for he looks at himself, goes away, and right away forgets what kind of man he was.
59Jms 1:25 But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts-- this person will be blessed in what he does.
59Jms 1:26 If anyone thinks he is religious, without controlling his tongue but deceiving his heart, his religion is useless.
59Jms 1:27 Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
59Jms 2:1 My brothers, hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ without showing favoritism.
59Jms 2:2 For suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring, dressed in fine clothes, and a poor man dressed in dirty clothes also comes in.
59Jms 2:3 If you look with favor on the man wearing the fine clothes so that you say, "Sit here in a good place," and yet you say to the poor man, "Stand over there," or, "Sit here on the floor by my footstool,"
59Jms 2:4 haven't you discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my dear brothers: Didn't God choose the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that He has promised to those who love Him?
59Jms 2:6 Yet you dishonored that poor man. Don't the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts?
59Jms 2:7 Don't they blaspheme the noble name that you bear?
59Jms 2:8 If you really carry out the royal law prescribed in Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well.
59Jms 2:9 But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
59Jms 2:10 For whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is guilty of [breaking it] all.
59Jms 2:11 For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. So if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you are a lawbreaker.
59Jms 2:12 Speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom.
59Jms 2:13 For judgment is without mercy to the one who hasn't shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
59Jms 2:14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but does not have works? Can his faith save him?
59Jms 2:15 If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food,
59Jms 2:16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well," but you don't give them what the body needs, what good is it?
59Jms 2:17 In the same way faith, if it doesn't have works, is dead by itself.
59Jms 2:18 But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you faith from my works.
59Jms 2:19 You believe that God is one; you do well. The demons also believe-- and they shudder.
59Jms 2:20 Foolish man! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless?
59Jms 2:21 Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
59Jms 2:22 You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was perfected.
59Jms 2:23 So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness, and he was called God's friend.
59Jms 2:24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 And in the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by a different route?
59Jms 2:26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
59Jms 3:1 Not many should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive a stricter judgment;
59Jms 3:2 for we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a mature man who is also able to control his whole body.
59Jms 3:3 Now when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide the whole animal.
59Jms 3:4 And consider ships: though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
59Jms 3:5 So too, though the tongue is a small part [of the body], it boasts great things. Consider how large a forest a small fire ignites.
59Jms 3:6 And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed among the parts of our [bodies]; it pollutes the whole body, sets the course of life on fire, and is set on fire by hell.
59Jms 3:7 For every creature-- animal or bird, reptile or fish-- is tamed and has been tamed by man,
59Jms 3:8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in God's likeness.
59Jms 3:10 Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things should not be this way.
59Jms 3:11 Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening?
59Jms 3:12 Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers, or a grapevine [produce] figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water.
59Jms 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among you? He should show his works by good conduct with wisdom's gentleness.
59Jms 3:14 But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't brag and lie in defiance of the truth.
59Jms 3:15 Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.
59Jms 3:16 For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil.
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without favoritism and hypocrisy.
59Jms 3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
59Jms 4:1 What is the source of the wars and the fights among you? Don't they come from the cravings that are at war within you?
59Jms 4:2 You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask.
59Jms 4:3 You ask and don't receive because you ask wrongly, so that you may spend it on your desires for pleasure.
59Jms 4:4 Adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? So whoever wants to be the world's friend becomes God's enemy.
59Jms 4:5 Or do you think it's without reason the Scripture says that the Spirit He has caused to live in us yearns jealously?
59Jms 4:6 But He gives greater grace. Therefore He says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
59Jms 4:7 Therefore, submit to God. But resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.
59Jms 4:8 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, double-minded people!
59Jms 4:9 Be miserable and mourn and weep. Your laughter must change to mourning and your joy to sorrow.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.
59Jms 4:11 Don't criticize one another, brothers. He who criticizes a brother or judges his brother criticizes the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
59Jms 4:12 There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
59Jms 4:13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit."
59Jms 4:14 You don't even know what tomorrow will bring-- what your life will be! For you are a bit of smoke that appears for a little while, then vanishes.
59Jms 4:15 Instead, you should say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 So, for the person who knows to do good and doesn't do it, it is a sin.
59Jms 5:1 Come now, you rich people! Weep and wail over the miseries that are coming on you.
59Jms 5:2 Your wealth is ruined: your clothes are moth-eaten;
59Jms 5:3 your silver and gold are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up treasure in the last days!
59Jms 5:4 Look! The pay that you withheld from the workers who reaped your fields cries out, and the outcry of the harvesters has reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.
59Jms 5:5 You have lived luxuriously on the land and have indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned-- you have murdered-- the righteous man; he does not resist you.
59Jms 5:7 Therefore, brothers, be patient until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and is patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains.
59Jms 5:8 You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the Lord's coming is near.
59Jms 5:9 Brothers, do not complain about one another, so that you will not be judged. Look, the judge stands at the door!
59Jms 5:10 Brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the Lord's name as an example of suffering and patience.
59Jms 5:11 See, we count as blessed those who have endured. You have heard of Job's endurance and have seen the outcome from the Lord: the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
59Jms 5:12 Now above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. Your "yes" must be "yes," and your "no" must be "no," so that you won't fall under judgment.
59Jms 5:13 Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises.
59Jms 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray over him after anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:15 The prayer of faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
59Jms 5:16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The intense prayer of the righteous is very powerful.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours; yet he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the land.
59Jms 5:18 Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its fruit.
59Jms 5:19 My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and someone turns him back,
59Jms 5:20 he should know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his life from death and cover a multitude of sins.

601Pt 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ: To the temporary residents of the Dispersion in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen
601Pt 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and set apart by the Spirit for obedience and [for the] sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
601Pt 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great mercy, He has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
601Pt 1:4 and into an inheritance that is imperishable, uncorrupted, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
601Pt 1:5 who are being protected by God's power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
601Pt 1:6 You rejoice in this, though now for a short time you have had to be distressed by various trials
601Pt 1:7 so that the genuineness of your faith-- more valuable than gold, which perishes though refined by fire-- may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 1:8 You love Him, though you have not seen Him. And though not seeing Him now, you believe in Him and rejoice with inexpressible and glorious joy,
601Pt 1:9 because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
601Pt 1:10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched and carefully investigated.
601Pt 1:11 They inquired into what time or what circumstances the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when He testified in advance to the messianic sufferings and the glories that would follow.
601Pt 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you concerning things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Angels desire to look into these things.
601Pt 1:13 Therefore, get your minds ready for action, being self-disciplined, and set your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 1:14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the desires of your former ignorance
601Pt 1:15 but, as the One who called you is holy, you also are to be holy in all your conduct;
601Pt 1:16 for it is written, Be holy, because I am holy.
601Pt 1:17 And if you address as Father the One who judges impartially based on each one's work, you are to conduct yourselves in reverence during this time of temporary residence.
601Pt 1:18 For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life inherited from the fathers, not with perishable things, like silver or gold,
601Pt 1:19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without defect or blemish.
601Pt 1:20 He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of the times for you
601Pt 1:21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
601Pt 1:22 By obedience to the truth, having purified yourselves for sincere love of the brothers, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
601Pt 1:23 since you have been born again-- not of perishable seed but of imperishable-- through the living and enduring word of God.
601Pt 1:24 For All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like a flower of the grass. The grass withers, and the flower drops off,
601Pt 1:25 but the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached as the gospel to you.
601Pt 2:1 So rid yourselves of all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander.
601Pt 2:2 Like newborn infants, desire the unadulterated spiritual milk, so that you may grow by it in [your] salvation,
601Pt 2:3 since you have tasted that the Lord is good.
601Pt 2:4 Coming to Him, a living stone-- rejected by men but chosen and valuable to God--
601Pt 2:5 you yourselves, as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
601Pt 2:6 For it stands in Scripture: Look! I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and valuable cornerstone, and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame!
601Pt 2:7 So the honor is for you who believe; but for the unbelieving, The stone that the builders rejected-- this One has become the cornerstone, and
601Pt 2:8 A stone that causes men to stumble, and a rock that trips them up. They stumble by disobeying the message; they were destined for this.
601Pt 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His possession, so that you may proclaim the praises of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
601Pt 2:10 Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
601Pt 2:11 Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and temporary residents to abstain from fleshly desires that war against you.
601Pt 2:12 Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that in a case where they speak against you as those who do evil, they may, by observing your good works, glorify God in a day of visitation.
601Pt 2:13 Submit to every human institution because of the Lord, whether to the Emperor as the supreme authority,
601Pt 2:14 or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
601Pt 2:15 For it is God's will that you, by doing good, silence the ignorance of foolish people.
601Pt 2:16 As God's slaves, [live] as free people, but don't use your freedom as a way to conceal evil.
601Pt 2:17 Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the Emperor.
601Pt 2:18 Household slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the cruel.
601Pt 2:19 For it [brings] favor if, because of conscience toward God, someone endures grief from suffering unjustly.
601Pt 2:20 For what credit is there if you endure when you sin and are beaten? But when you do good and suffer, if you endure, it brings favor with God.
601Pt 2:21 For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in His steps.
601Pt 2:22 He did not commit sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth;
601Pt 2:23 when reviled, He did not revile in return; when suffering, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to the One who judges justly.
601Pt 2:24 He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that, having died to sins, we might live for righteousness; by His wounding you have been healed.
601Pt 2:25 For you were like sheep going astray, but you have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, even if some disobey the [Christian] message, they may be won over without a message by the way their wives live,
601Pt 3:2 when they observe your pure, reverent lives.
601Pt 3:3 Your beauty should not consist of outward things [like] elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold ornaments or fine clothes;
601Pt 3:4 instead, [it should consist of] the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very valuable in God's eyes.
601Pt 3:5 For in the past, the holy women who hoped in God also beautified themselves in this way, submitting to their own husbands,
601Pt 3:6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You have become her children when you do good and aren't frightened by anything alarming.
601Pt 3:7 Husbands, in the same way, live with your wives with understanding of their weaker nature yet showing them honor as co-heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
601Pt 3:8 Now finally, all of you should be like-minded and sympathetic, should love believers, and be compassionate and humble,
601Pt 3:9 not paying back evil for evil or insult for insult but, on the contrary, giving a blessing, since you were called for this, so that you can inherit a blessing.
601Pt 3:10 For the one who wants to love life and to see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit,
601Pt 3:11 and he must turn away from evil and do good. He must seek peace and pursue it,
601Pt 3:12 because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are open to their request. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
601Pt 3:13 And who will harm you if you are passionate for what is good?
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear or be disturbed,
601Pt 3:15 but set apart the Messiah as Lord in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you.
601Pt 3:16 However, do this with gentleness and respect, keeping your conscience clear, so that when you are accused, those who denounce your Christian life will be put to shame.
601Pt 3:17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
601Pt 3:18 For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm.
601Pt 3:19 In that state He also went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison
601Pt 3:20 who in the past were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah while an ark was being prepared; in it, a few-- that is, eight people-- were saved through water.
601Pt 3:21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the pledge of a good conscience toward God) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 3:22 Now that He has gone into heaven, He is at God's right hand, with angels, authorities, and powers subjected to Him.
601Pt 4:1 Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same resolve-- because the One who suffered in the flesh has finished with sin--
601Pt 4:2 in order to live the remaining time in the flesh, no longer for human desires, but for God's will.
601Pt 4:3 For there has already been enough time spent in doing the will of the pagans: carrying on in unrestrained behavior, evil desires, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and lawless idolatry.
601Pt 4:4 In regard to this, they are surprised that you don't plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation-- and they slander you.
601Pt 4:5 They will give an account to the One who stands ready to judge the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 For this reason the gospel was also preached to [those who are now] dead, so that, although they might be judged by men in the fleshly realm, they might live by God in the spiritual realm.
601Pt 4:7 Now the end of all things is near; therefore, be clear-headed and disciplined for prayer.
601Pt 4:8 Above all, keep your love for one another at full strength, since love covers a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
601Pt 4:10 Based on the gift they have received, everyone should use it to serve others, as good managers of the varied grace of God.
601Pt 4:11 If anyone speaks, [his speech should be] like the oracles of God; if anyone serves, [his service should be] from the strength God provides, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 4:12 Dear friends, when the fiery ordeal arises among you to test you, don't be surprised by it, as if something unusual were happening to you.
601Pt 4:13 Instead, as you share in the sufferings of the Messiah rejoice, so that you may also rejoice with great joy at the revelation of His glory.
601Pt 4:14 If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
601Pt 4:15 None of you, however, should suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a meddler.
601Pt 4:16 But if [anyone suffers] as a Christian, he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God with that name.
601Pt 4:17 For the time has come for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?
601Pt 4:18 And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
601Pt 4:19 So those who suffer according to God's will should, in doing good, entrust themselves to a faithful Creator.
601Pt 5:1 Therefore, as a fellow elder and witness to the sufferings of the Messiah, and also a participant in the glory about to be revealed, I exhort the elders among you:
601Pt 5:2 shepherd God's flock among you, not overseeing out of compulsion but freely, according to God's [will]; not for the money but eagerly;
601Pt 5:3 not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
601Pt 5:4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
601Pt 5:5 Likewise, you younger men, be subject to the elders. And all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
601Pt 5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time,
601Pt 5:7 casting all your care upon Him, because He cares about you.
601Pt 5:8 Be sober! Be on the alert! Your adversary the Devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour.
601Pt 5:9 Resist him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being experienced by your brothers in the world.
601Pt 5:10 Now the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will personally restore, establish, strengthen, and support you after you have suffered a little.
601Pt 5:11 To Him be the dominion forever. Amen.
601Pt 5:12 Through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, I have written briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Take your stand in it!
601Pt 5:13 She who is in Babylon, also chosen, sends you greetings, as does Mark, my son.
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61
612Pt 1:1 Simeon Peter, a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ: To those who have obtained a faith of equal privilege with ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:2 May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
612Pt 1:3 For His divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness.
612Pt 1:4 By these He has given us very great and precious promises, so that through them you may share in the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world because of evil desires.
612Pt 1:5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge,
612Pt 1:6 knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with godliness,
612Pt 1:7 godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.
612Pt 1:8 For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:9 The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins.
612Pt 1:10 Therefore, brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election, because if you do these things you will never stumble.
612Pt 1:11 For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you.
612Pt 1:12 Therefore I will always remind you about these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth you have.
612Pt 1:13 I consider it right, as long as I am in this tent, to wake you up with a reminder,
612Pt 1:14 knowing that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has also shown me.
612Pt 1:15 And I will also make every effort that after my departure you may be able to recall these things at any time.
612Pt 1:16 For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
612Pt 1:17 For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory: This is My beloved Son. I take delight in Him!
612Pt 1:18 And we heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain.
612Pt 1:19 So we have the prophetic word strongly confirmed. You will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dismal place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.
612Pt 1:20 First of all, you should know this: no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation,
612Pt 1:21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, moved by the Holy Spirit, men spoke from God.
612Pt 2:1 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, and will bring swift destruction on themselves.
612Pt 2:2 Many will follow their unrestrained ways, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
612Pt 2:3 In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation, [pronounced] long ago, is not idle, and their destruction does not sleep.
612Pt 2:4 For if God didn't spare the angels who sinned, but threw them down into Tartarus and delivered them to be kept in chains of darkness until judgment;
612Pt 2:5 and if He didn't spare the ancient world, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when He brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;
612Pt 2:6 and if He reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to ruin, making them an example to those who were going to be ungodly;
612Pt 2:7 and if He rescued righteous Lot, distressed by the unrestrained behavior of the immoral
612Pt 2:8 (for as he lived among them, that righteous man tormented himself day by day with the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--
612Pt 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,
612Pt 2:10 especially those who follow the polluting desires of the flesh and despise authority. Bold, arrogant people! They do not tremble when they blaspheme the glorious ones;
612Pt 2:11 however, angels, who are greater in might and power, do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord.
612Pt 2:12 But these people, like irrational animals-- creatures of instinct born to be caught and destroyed-- speak blasphemies about things they don't understand, and in their destruction they too will be destroyed,
612Pt 2:13 suffering harm as the payment for unrighteousness. They consider it a pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, delighting in their deceptions as they feast with you,
612Pt 2:14 having eyes full of adultery and always looking for sin, seducing unstable people, and with hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!
612Pt 2:15 By abandoning the straight path, they have gone astray and have followed the path of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
612Pt 2:16 but received a rebuke for his transgression: a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
612Pt 2:17 These people are springs without water, mists driven by a whirlwind. The gloom of darkness has been reserved for them.
612Pt 2:18 For uttering bombastic, empty words, they seduce, by fleshly desires and debauchery, people who have barely escaped from those who live in error.
612Pt 2:19 They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them.
612Pt 2:20 For if, having escaped the world's impurity through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in these things and defeated, the last state is worse for them than the first.
612Pt 2:21 For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
612Pt 2:22 It has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to its own vomit, and, "a sow, after washing itself, wallows in the mud."
612Pt 3:1 Dear friends, this is now the second letter I've written you; in both, I awaken your pure understanding with a reminder,
612Pt 3:2 so that you can remember the words previously spoken by the holy prophets, and the commandment of our Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles.
612Pt 3:3 First, be aware of this: scoffers will come in the last days to scoff, following their own lusts,
612Pt 3:4 saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they have been since the beginning of creation."
612Pt 3:5 They willfully ignore this: long ago the heavens and the earth existed out of water and through water by the word of God.
612Pt 3:6 Through these the world of that time perished when it was flooded by water.
612Pt 3:7 But by the same word the present heavens and earth are held in store for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
612Pt 3:8 Dear friends, don't let this one thing escape you: with the Lord one day is like 1,000 years, and 1,000 years like one day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but all to come to repentance.
612Pt 3:10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief; on that [day] the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed.
612Pt 3:11 Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, [it is clear] what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness
612Pt 3:12 as you wait for and earnestly desire the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be on fire and be dissolved, and the elements will melt with the heat.
612Pt 3:13 But based on His promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell.
612Pt 3:14 Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found in peace without spot or blemish before Him.
612Pt 3:15 Also, regard the patience of our Lord as [an opportunity for] salvation, just as our dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you.
612Pt 3:16 He speaks about these things in all his letters, in which there are some matters that are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable twist them to their own destruction, as they also do with the rest of the Scriptures.
612Pt 3:17 Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard, so that you are not led away by the error of the immoral and fall from your own stability.
612Pt 3:18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

621Jn 1:1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed, and have touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life--
621Jn 1:2 that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us--
621Jn 1:3 what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship along with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
621Jn 1:4 We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
621Jn 1:5 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in Him.
621Jn 1:6 If we say, "We have fellowship with Him," and walk in darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth.
621Jn 1:7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we say, "We have no sin," we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
621Jn 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
621Jn 1:10 If we say, "We have not sinned," we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
621Jn 2:1 My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father-- Jesus Christ the righteous One.
621Jn 2:2 He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world.
621Jn 2:3 This is how we are sure that we have come to know Him: by keeping His commands.
621Jn 2:4 The one who says, "I have come to know Him," without keeping His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
621Jn 2:5 But whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God is perfected. This is how we know we are in Him:
621Jn 2:6 the one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked.
621Jn 2:7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command, but an old command that you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message you have heard.
621Jn 2:8 Yet I am writing you a new command, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
621Jn 2:9 The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
621Jn 2:10 The one who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
621Jn 2:11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he's going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
621Jn 2:12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name.
621Jn 2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have had victory over the evil one.
621Jn 2:14 I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, God's word remains in you, and you have had victory over the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Do not love the world or the things that belong to the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. Because everything that belongs to the world--
621Jn 2:16 the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one's lifestyle-- is not from the Father, but is from the world.
621Jn 2:17 And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does God's will remains forever.
621Jn 2:18 Children, it is the last hour. And as you have heard, "Antichrist is coming," even now many antichrists have come. We know from this that it is the last hour.
621Jn 2:19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. However, they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them belongs to us.
621Jn 2:20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.
621Jn 2:21 I have not written to you because you don't know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth.
621Jn 2:22 Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Messiah? He is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
621Jn 2:23 No one who denies the Son can have the Father; he who confesses the Son has the Father as well.
621Jn 2:24 What you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father.
621Jn 2:25 And this is the promise that He Himself made to us: eternal life.
621Jn 2:26 I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
621Jn 2:27 The anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you don't need anyone to teach you. Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie; just as it has taught you, remain in Him.
621Jn 2:28 So now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He appears we may have boldness and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.
621Jn 2:29 If you know that He is righteous, you know this as well: everyone who does what is right has been born of Him.
621Jn 3:1 Look at how great a love the Father has given us, that we should be called God's children. And we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn't know Him.
621Jn 3:2 Dear friends, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is.
621Jn 3:3 And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself just as He is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who commits sin also breaks the law; sin is the breaking of law.
621Jn 3:5 You know that He was revealed so that He might take away sins, and there is no sin in Him.
621Jn 3:6 Everyone who remains in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him.
621Jn 3:7 Little children, let no one deceive you! The one who does what is right is righteous, just as He is righteous.
621Jn 3:8 The one who commits sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose: to destroy the Devil's works.
621Jn 3:9 Everyone who has been born of God does not sin, because His seed remains in him; he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God.
621Jn 3:10 This is how God's children-- and the Devil's children-- are made evident. Whoever does not do what is right is not of God, especially the one who does not love his brother.
621Jn 3:11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: we should love one another,
621Jn 3:12 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's were righteous.
621Jn 3:13 Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.
621Jn 3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.
621Jn 3:16 This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers.
621Jn 3:17 If anyone has this world's goods and sees his brother in need but shuts off his compassion from him-- how can God's love reside in him?
621Jn 3:18 Little children, we must not love in word or speech, but in deed and truth;
621Jn 3:19 that is how we will know we are of the truth, and will convince our hearts in His presence,
621Jn 3:20 because if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.
621Jn 3:21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn [us] we have confidence before God,
621Jn 3:22 and can receive whatever we ask from Him because we keep His commands and do what is pleasing in His sight.
621Jn 3:23 Now this is His command: that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as He commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 The one who keeps His commands remains in Him, and He in him. And the way we know that He remains in us is from the Spirit He has given us.
621Jn 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
621Jn 4:2 This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
621Jn 4:3 But every spirit who does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that he is coming, and he is already in the world now.
621Jn 4:4 You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
621Jn 4:5 They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
621Jn 4:7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
621Jn 4:9 God's love was revealed among us in this way: God sent His One and Only Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
621Jn 4:10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another.
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and His love is perfected in us.
621Jn 4:13 This is how we know that we remain in Him and He in us: He has given to us from His Spirit.
621Jn 4:14 And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God-- God remains in him and he in God.
621Jn 4:16 And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.
621Jn 4:17 In this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; for we are as He is in this world.
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love.
621Jn 4:19 We love because He first loved us.
621Jn 4:20 If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
621Jn 4:21 And we have this command from Him: the one who loves God must also love his brother.
621Jn 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent also loves his child.
621Jn 5:2 This is how we know that we love God's children when we love God and obey His commands.
621Jn 5:3 For this is what love for God is: to keep His commands. Now His commands are not a burden,
621Jn 5:4 because whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.
621Jn 5:5 And who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
621Jn 5:6 Jesus Christ-- He is the One who came by water and blood; not by water only, but by water and by blood. And the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
621Jn 5:7 For there are three that testify:
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood-- and these three are in agreement.
621Jn 5:9 If we accept the testimony of men, God's testimony is greater, because it is God's testimony that He has given about His Son.
621Jn 5:10 (The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given about His Son.)
621Jn 5:11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
621Jn 5:12 The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesn't have the Son of God does not have life.
621Jn 5:13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 Now this is the confidence we have before Him: whenever we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
621Jn 5:15 And if we know that He hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked Him for.
621Jn 5:16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not bring death, he should ask, and God will give life to him-- to those who commit sin that doesn't bring death. There is sin that brings death. I am not saying he should pray about that.
621Jn 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that does not bring death.
621Jn 5:18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not sin, but the One who is born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the sway of the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One. We are in the true One-- that is, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
621Jn 5:21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.

632Jn 1:1 The Elder: To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth-- and not only I, but also all who have come to know the truth--
632Jn 1:2 because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever.
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
632Jn 1:4 I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, in keeping with a command we have received from the Father.
632Jn 1:5 So now I urge you, lady-- not as if I were writing you a new command, but one we have had from the beginning-- that we love one another.
632Jn 1:6 And this is love: that we walk according to His commands. This is the command as you have heard it from the beginning: you must walk in love.
632Jn 1:7 Many deceivers have gone out into the world; they do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
632Jn 1:8 Watch yourselves so that you don't lose what we have worked for, but you may receive a full reward.
632Jn 1:9 Anyone who does not remain in the teaching about Christ, but goes beyond it, does not have God. The one who remains in that teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home, and don't say, "Welcome," to him;
632Jn 1:11 for the one who says, "Welcome," to him shares in his evil works.
632Jn 1:12 Though I have many things to write to you, I don't want to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to be with you and talk face to face so that our joy may be complete.
632Jn 1:13 The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
64
643Jn 1:1 The Elder: To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in truth.
643Jn 1:2 Dear friend, I pray that you may prosper in every way and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.
643Jn 1:3 For I was very glad when some brothers came and testified to your [faithfulness] to the truth-- how you are walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:4 I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:5 Dear friend, you are showing your faith by whatever you do for the brothers, and this [you are doing] for strangers;
643Jn 1:6 they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God,
643Jn 1:7 since they set out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from pagans.
643Jn 1:8 Therefore, we ought to support such men, so that we can be co-workers with the truth.
643Jn 1:9 I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have first place among them, does not receive us.
643Jn 1:10 This is why, if I come, I will remind him of the works he is doing, slandering us with malicious words. And he is not satisfied with that! He not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself, but he even stops those who want to do so and expels them from the church.
643Jn 1:11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
643Jn 1:12 Demetrius has a [good] testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. And we also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.
643Jn 1:13 I have many things to write you, but I don't want to write to you with pen and ink.
643Jn 1:14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace be with you. The friends send you greetings. Greet the friends by name.

65Jd 1:1 Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and a brother of James: To those who are the called, loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:2 May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
65Jd 1:3 Dear friends, although I was eager to write you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write and exhort you to contend for the faith that was delivered to the saints once for all.
65Jd 1:4 For certain men, who were designated for this judgment long ago, have come in by stealth; they are ungodly, turning the grace of our God into promiscuity and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:5 Now I want to remind you, though you know all these things: the Lord, having first of all saved a people out of Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe;
65Jd 1:6 and He has kept, with eternal chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day, angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling.
65Jd 1:7 In the same way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them committed sexual immorality and practiced perversions, just as they did, and serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
65Jd 1:8 Nevertheless, these dreamers likewise defile their flesh, despise authority, and blaspheme glorious beings.
65Jd 1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when he was disputing with the Devil in a debate about Moses' body, did not dare bring an abusive condemnation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
65Jd 1:10 But these people blaspheme anything they don't understand, and what they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals-- they destroy themselves with these things.
65Jd 1:11 Woe to them! For they have traveled in the way of Cain, have abandoned themselves to the error of Balaam for profit, and have perished in Korah's rebellion.
65Jd 1:12 These are the ones who are like dangerous reefs at your love feasts. They feast with you, nurturing only themselves without fear. They are waterless clouds carried along by winds; trees in late autumn-- fruitless, twice dead, pulled out by the roots;
65Jd 1:13 wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameful deeds; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever!
65Jd 1:14 And Enoch, in the seventh [generation] from Adam, prophesied about them: Look! The Lord comes with thousands of His holy ones
65Jd 1:15 to execute judgment on all, and to convict them of all their ungodly deeds that they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things ungodly sinners have said against Him.
65Jd 1:16 These people are discontented grumblers, walking according to their desires; their mouths utter arrogant words, flattering people for their own advantage.
65Jd 1:17 But you, dear friends, remember the words foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
65Jd 1:18 they told you, "In the end time there will be scoffers walking according to their own ungodly desires."
65Jd 1:19 These people create divisions and are merely natural, not having the Spirit.
65Jd 1:20 But you, dear friends, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
65Jd 1:21 keep yourselves in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life.
65Jd 1:22 Have mercy on some who doubt;
65Jd 1:23 save others by snatching [them] from the fire; on others have mercy in fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.
65Jd 1:24 Now to Him who is able to protect you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of His glory, blameless and with great joy,
65Jd 1:25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time, now, and forever. Amen.

66Rv 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave Him to show His slaves what must quickly take place. He sent it and signified it through His angel to His slave John,
66Rv 1:2 who testified to God's word and to the testimony about Jesus Christ, in all he saw.
66Rv 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it, because the time is near!
66Rv 1:4 John: To the seven churches in the province of Asia. Grace and peace to you from the One who is, who was, and who is coming; from the seven spirits before His throne;
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has set us free from our sins by His blood,
66Rv 1:6 and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father-- to Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
66Rv 1:7 Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, including those who pierced Him. And all the families of the earth will mourn over Him. This is certain. Amen.
66Rv 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the One who is, who was, and who is coming, the Almighty."
66Rv 1:9 I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation, kingdom, and perseverance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of God's word and the testimony about Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
66Rv 1:11 saying, "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."
66Rv 1:12 I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. When I turned I saw seven gold lampstands,
66Rv 1:13 and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a long robe, and with a gold sash wrapped around His chest.
66Rv 1:14 His head and hair were white like wool-- white as snow, His eyes like a fiery flame,
66Rv 1:15 His feet like fine bronze fired in a furnace, and His voice like the sound of cascading waters.
66Rv 1:16 In His right hand He had seven stars; from His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was shining like the sun at midday.
66Rv 1:17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. He laid His right hand on me, and said, "Don't be afraid! I am the First and the Last,
66Rv 1:18 and the Living One. I was dead, but look-- I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades.
66Rv 1:19 Therefore write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this.
66Rv 1:20 The secret of the seven stars you saw in My right hand, and of the seven gold lampstands, is this: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66Rv 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: "The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands says:
66Rv 2:2 I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate evil. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you have found them to be liars.
66Rv 2:3 You also possess endurance and have tolerated [many things] because of My name, and have not grown weary.
66Rv 2:4 But I have this against you: you have abandoned the love [you had] at first.
66Rv 2:5 Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place-- unless you repent.
66Rv 2:6 Yet you do have this: you hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66Rv 2:7 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66Rv 2:8 "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: "The First and the Last, the One who was dead and came to life, says:
66Rv 2:9 I know your tribulation and poverty, yet you are rich. [I know] the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66Rv 2:10 Don't be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will have tribulation for 10 days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66Rv 2:11 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor will never be harmed by the second death.
66Rv 2:12 "To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: "The One who has the sharp, two-edged sword says:
66Rv 2:13 I know where you live-- where Satan's throne is! And you are holding on to My name and did not deny your faith in Me, even in the days of Antipas, My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.
66Rv 2:14 But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block in front of the sons of Israel: to eat meat sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.
66Rv 2:15 In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66Rv 2:16 Therefore repent! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth.
66Rv 2:17 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.
66Rv 2:18 "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: "The Son of God, the One whose eyes are like a fiery flame, and whose feet are like fine bronze says:
66Rv 2:19 I know your works-- your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the first.
66Rv 2:20 But I have this against you: you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives My slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat meat sacrificed to idols.
66Rv 2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality.
66Rv 2:22 Look! I will throw her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her practices.
66Rv 2:23 I will kill her children with the plague. Then all the churches will know that I am the One who examines minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works.
66Rv 2:24 I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who haven't known the deep things of Satan-- as they say-- I do not put any other burden on you.
66Rv 2:25 But hold on to what you have until I come.
66Rv 2:26 The victor and the one who keeps My works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations--
66Rv 2:27 and He will shepherd them with an iron scepter; He will shatter them like pottery-- just as I have received [this] from My Father.
66Rv 2:28 I will also give him the morning star.
66Rv 2:29 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:1 "To the angel of the church in Sardis write: "The One who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says: I know your works; you have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.
66Rv 3:2 Be alert and strengthen what remains, which is about to die, for I have not found your works complete before My God.
66Rv 3:3 Remember therefore what you have received and heard; keep it, and repent. But if you are not alert, I will come like a thief, and you have no idea at what hour I will come against you.
66Rv 3:4 But you have a few people in Sardis who have not defiled their clothes, and they will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy.
66Rv 3:5 In the same way, the victor will be dressed in white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before My Father and before His angels.
66Rv 3:6 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:7 "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: "The Holy One, the True One, the One who has the key of David, who opens and no one will close, and closes and no one opens says:
66Rv 3:8 I know your works. Because you have limited strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close.
66Rv 3:9 Take note! I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying-- note this-- I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.
66Rv 3:10 Because you have kept My command to endure, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is going to come over the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
66Rv 3:11 I am coming quickly. Hold on to what you have, so that no one takes your crown.
66Rv 3:12 The victor: I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God-- the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God-- and My new name.
66Rv 3:13 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:14 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: "The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Originator of God's creation says:
66Rv 3:15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot.
66Rv 3:16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of My mouth.
66Rv 3:17 Because you say, 'I'm rich; I have become wealthy, and need nothing,' and you don't know that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked,
66Rv 3:18 I advise you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire so that you may be rich, and white clothes so that you may be dressed and your shameful nakedness not be exposed, and ointment to spread on your eyes so that you may see.
66Rv 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be committed and repent.
66Rv 3:20 Listen! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and have dinner with him, and he with Me.
66Rv 3:21 The victor: I will give him the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also won the victory and sat down with My Father on His throne.
66Rv 3:22 "Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches."
66Rv 4:1 After this I looked, and there in heaven was an open door. The first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."
66Rv 4:2 Immediately I was in the Spirit, and there in heaven a throne was set. One was seated on the throne,
66Rv 4:3 and the One seated looked like jasper and carnelian stone. A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne.
66Rv 4:4 Around that throne were 24 thrones, and on the thrones sat 24 elders dressed in white clothes, with gold crowns on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and thunder. Burning before the throne were seven fiery torches, which are the seven spirits of God.
66Rv 4:6 Also before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle and around the throne were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back.
66Rv 4:7 The first living creature was like a lion; the second living creature was like a calf; the third living creature had a face like a man; and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
66Rv 4:8 Each of the four living creatures had six wings; they were covered with eyes around and inside. Day and night they never stop, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Almighty, who was, who is, and who is coming.
66Rv 4:9 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever,
66Rv 4:10 the 24 elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, worship the One who lives forever and ever, cast their crowns before the throne, and say:
66Rv 4:11 Our Lord and God, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because You have created all things, and because of Your will they exist and were created.
66Rv 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne a scroll with writing on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
66Rv 5:2 I also saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"
66Rv 5:3 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look in it.
66Rv 5:4 And I cried and cried because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or even to look in it.
66Rv 5:5 Then one of the elders said to me, "Stop crying. Look! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has been victorious so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals."
66Rv 5:6 Then I saw one like a slaughtered lamb standing between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.
66Rv 5:7 He came and took [the scroll] out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne.
66Rv 5:8 When He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66Rv 5:9 And they sang a new song: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals; because You were slaughtered, and You redeemed [people] for God by Your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation.
66Rv 5:10 You made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth.
66Rv 5:11 Then I looked, and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and also of the living creatures, and of the elders. Their number was countless thousands, plus thousands of thousands.
66Rv 5:12 They said with a loud voice: The Lamb who was slaughtered is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!
66Rv 5:13 I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them say: Blessing and honor and glory and dominion to the One seated on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!
66Rv 5:14 The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66Rv 6:1 Then I saw the Lamb open one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, "Come!"
66Rv 6:2 I looked, and there was a white horse. The horseman on it had a bow; a crown was given to him, and he went out as a victor to conquer.
66Rv 6:3 When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:4 Then another horse went out, a fiery red one, and its horseman was empowered to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another. And a large sword was given to him.
66Rv 6:5 When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" And I looked, and there was a black horse. The horseman on it had a balance scale in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 Then I heard something like a voice among the four living creatures say, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius-- but do not harm the olive oil and the wine."
66Rv 6:7 When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:8 And I looked, and there was a pale green horse. The horseman on it was named Death, and Hades was following after him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by plague, and by the wild animals of the earth.
66Rv 6:9 When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slaughtered because of God's word and the testimony they had.
66Rv 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice: "O Lord, holy and true, how long until You judge and avenge our blood from those who live on the earth?"
66Rv 6:11 So a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer until [the number of] their fellow slaves and their brothers, who were going to be killed just as they had been, would be completed.
66Rv 6:12 Then I saw Him open the sixth seal. A violent earthquake occurred; the sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair; the entire moon became like blood;
66Rv 6:13 the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a high wind;
66Rv 6:14 the sky separated like a scroll being rolled up; and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
66Rv 6:15 Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the military commanders, the rich, the powerful, and every slave and free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66Rv 6:16 And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
66Rv 6:17 because the great day of Their wrath has come! And who is able to stand?"
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.
66Rv 7:2 Then I saw another angel rise up from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who were empowered to harm the earth and the sea:
66Rv 7:3 "Don't harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God on their foreheads."
66Rv 7:4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
66Rv 7:5 12,000 sealed from the tribe of Judah, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
66Rv 7:6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
66Rv 7:7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
66Rv 7:8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.
66Rv 7:9 After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were robed in white with palm branches in their hands.
66Rv 7:10 And they cried out in a loud voice: Salvation belongs to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!
66Rv 7:11 All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66Rv 7:12 saying: Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
66Rv 7:13 Then one of the elders asked me, "Who are these people robed in white, and where did they come from?"
66Rv 7:14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." Then he told me: These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66Rv 7:15 For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His sanctuary. The One seated on the throne will shelter them:
66Rv 7:16 no longer will they hunger; no longer will they thirst; no longer will the sun strike them, or any heat.
66Rv 7:17 Because the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them; He will guide them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
66Rv 8:1 When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66Rv 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand in the presence of God; seven trumpets were given to them.
66Rv 8:3 Another angel, with a gold incense burner, came and stood at the altar. He was given a large amount of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar in front of the throne.
66Rv 8:4 The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up in the presence of God from the angel's hand.
66Rv 8:5 The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; there were thunders, rumblings, lightnings, and an earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
66Rv 8:7 The first [angel] blew his trumpet, and hail and fire, mixed with blood, were hurled to the earth. So a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
66Rv 8:8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain ablaze with fire was hurled into the sea. So a third of the sea became blood,
66Rv 8:9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66Rv 8:10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from heaven. It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water.
66Rv 8:11 The name of the star is Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood. So, many of the people died from the waters, because they had been made bitter.
66Rv 8:12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day was without light, and the night as well.
66Rv 8:13 I looked, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid-heaven, saying in a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining trumpet blasts that the three angels are about to sound!"
66Rv 9:1 The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth. The key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him.
66Rv 9:2 He opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke came up out of the shaft like smoke from a great furnace so that the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft.
66Rv 9:3 Then out of the smoke locusts came to the earth, and power was given to them like the power that scorpions have on the earth.
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green plant, or any tree, but only people who do not have God's seal on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 They were not permitted to kill them, but were to torment [them] for five months; their torment is like the torment caused by a scorpion when it strikes a man.
66Rv 9:6 In those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.
66Rv 9:7 The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were something like gold crowns; their faces were like men's faces;
66Rv 9:8 they had hair like women's hair; their teeth were like lions' teeth;
66Rv 9:9 they had chests like iron breastplates; the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle;
66Rv 9:10 and they had tails with stingers, like scorpions, so that with their tails they had the power to harm people for five months.
66Rv 9:11 They had as their king the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
66Rv 9:12 The first woe has passed. There are still two more woes to come after this.
66Rv 9:13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet. From the four horns of the gold altar that is before God, I heard a voice
66Rv 9:14 say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates."
66Rv 9:15 So the four angels who were prepared for the hour, day, month, and year were released to kill a third of the human race.
66Rv 9:16 The number of mounted troops was 200 million; I heard their number.
66Rv 9:17 This is how I saw the horses in my vision: The horsemen had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.
66Rv 9:18 A third of the human race was killed by these three plagues-- by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths.
66Rv 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails, like snakes, have heads, and they inflict injury with them.
66Rv 9:20 The rest of the people, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands to stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which are not able to see, hear, or walk.
66Rv 9:21 And they did not repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, his legs were like fiery pillars,
66Rv 10:2 and he had a little scroll opened in his hand. He put his right foot on the sea, his left on the land,
66Rv 10:3 and he cried out with a loud voice like a roaring lion. When he cried out, the seven thunders spoke with their voices.
66Rv 10:4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. Then I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down!"
66Rv 10:5 Then the angel that I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
66Rv 10:6 He swore an oath by the One who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: "There will no longer be an interval of time,
66Rv 10:7 but in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, when he will blow his trumpet, then God's hidden plan will be completed, as He announced to His servants the prophets."
66Rv 10:8 Now the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66Rv 10:9 So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, "Take and eat it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth."
66Rv 10:10 Then I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I ate it, my stomach became bitter.
66Rv 10:11 And I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66Rv 11:1 Then I was given a measuring reed like a rod, with these words: "Go and measure God's sanctuary and the altar, and [count] those who worship there.
66Rv 11:2 But exclude the courtyard outside the sanctuary. Don't measure it, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for 42 months.
66Rv 11:3 I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth."
66Rv 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66Rv 11:5 If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
66Rv 11:6 These men have the power to close the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy. They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with any plague whenever they want.
66Rv 11:7 When they finish their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, conquer them, and kill them.
66Rv 11:8 Their dead bodies will lie in the public square of the great city, which is called, prophetically, Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66Rv 11:9 And representatives from the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will view their bodies for three and a half days and not permit their bodies to be put into a tomb.
66Rv 11:10 Those who live on the earth will gloat over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth.
66Rv 11:11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. So great fear fell on those who saw them.
66Rv 11:12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." They went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.
66Rv 11:13 At that moment a violent earthquake took place, a tenth of the city fell, and 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake. The survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66Rv 11:14 The second woe has passed. Take note: the third woe is coming quickly!
66Rv 11:15 The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven saying: The kingdom of the world has become the [kingdom] of our Lord and of His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever!
66Rv 11:16 The 24 elders, who were seated before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66Rv 11:17 saying: We thank You, Lord God, the Almighty, who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.
66Rv 11:18 The nations were angry, but Your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.
66Rv 11:19 God's sanctuary in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His sanctuary. There were lightnings, rumblings, thunders, an earthquake, and severe hail.
66Rv 12:1 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of 12 stars on her head.
66Rv 12:2 She was pregnant and cried out in labor and agony to give birth.
66Rv 12:3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: There was a great fiery red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
66Rv 12:4 His tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth. And the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she did give birth he might devour her child.
66Rv 12:5 But she gave birth to a Son-- a male who is going to shepherd all nations with an iron scepter-- and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
66Rv 12:6 The woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, to be fed there for 1,260 days.
66Rv 12:7 Then war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels also fought,
66Rv 12:8 but he could not prevail, and there was no place for them in heaven any longer.
66Rv 12:9 So the great dragon was thrown out-- the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world. He was thrown to earth, and his angels with him.
66Rv 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Messiah have now come, because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown out: the one who accuses them before our God day and night.
66Rv 12:11 They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they did not love their lives in the face of death.
66Rv 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the Devil has come down to you with great fury, because he knows he has a short time.
66Rv 12:13 When the dragon saw that he had been thrown to earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male.
66Rv 12:14 The woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she could fly from the serpent's presence to her place in the wilderness, where she was fed for a time, times, and half a time.
66Rv 12:15 From his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river after the woman, to sweep her away in a torrent.
66Rv 12:16 But the earth helped the woman: the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth.
66Rv 12:17 So the dragon was furious with the woman and left to wage war against the rest of her offspring-- those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony about Jesus.
66Rv 12:18 He stood on the sand of the sea.
66Rv 13:1 And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. He had 10 horns and seven heads. On his horns were 10 diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.
66Rv 13:2 The beast I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like a bear's, and his mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
66Rv 13:3 One of his heads appeared to be fatally wounded, but his fatal wound was healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast.
66Rv 13:4 They worshiped the dragon because he gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to wage war against him?"
66Rv 13:5 A mouth was given to him to speak boasts and blasphemies. He was also given authority to act for 42 months.
66Rv 13:6 He began to speak blasphemies against God: to blaspheme His name and His dwelling-- those who dwell in heaven.
66Rv 13:7 And he was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. He was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.
66Rv 13:8 All those who live on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name was not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.
66Rv 13:9 If anyone has an ear, he should listen:
66Rv 13:10 If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
66Rv 13:11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; he had two horns like a lamb, but he sounded like a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 He exercises all the authority of the first beast on his behalf and compels the earth and those who live on it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
66Rv 13:13 He also performs great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth before people.
66Rv 13:14 He deceives those who live on the earth because of the signs that he is permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, telling those who live on the earth to make an image of the beast who had the sword wound yet lived.
66Rv 13:15 He was permitted to give a spirit to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could both speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
66Rv 13:16 And he requires everyone-- small and great, rich and poor, free and slave-- to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,
66Rv 13:17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast's name or the number of his name.
66Rv 13:18 Here is wisdom: The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666.
66Rv 14:1 Then I looked, and there on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with Him were 144,000 who had His name and His Father's name written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of cascading waters and like the rumbling of loud thunder. The sound I heard was also like harpists playing on their harps.
66Rv 14:3 They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, but no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 These are the ones not defiled with women, for they have kept their virginity. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They were redeemed from the human race as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb.
66Rv 14:5 No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
66Rv 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth-- to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
66Rv 14:7 He spoke with a loud voice: "Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water."
66Rv 14:8 A second angel followed, saying: "It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen, who made all nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality, which brings wrath."
66Rv 14:9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
66Rv 14:10 he will also drink the wine of God's wrath, which is mixed full strength in the cup of His anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb,
66Rv 14:11 and the smoke of their torment will go up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or anyone who receives the mark of his name.
66Rv 14:12 Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith in Jesus."
66Rv 14:13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "let them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!"
66Rv 14:14 Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and One like the Son of Man was seated on the cloud, with a gold crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.
66Rv 14:15 Another angel came out of the sanctuary, crying out in a loud voice to the One who was seated on the cloud, "Use your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66Rv 14:16 So the One seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
66Rv 14:17 Then another angel who also had a sharp sickle came out of the sanctuary in heaven.
66Rv 14:18 Yet another angel, who had authority over fire, came from the altar, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, "Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from earth's vineyard, because its grapes have ripened."
66Rv 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle toward earth and gathered the grapes from earth's vineyard, and he threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.
66Rv 14:20 Then the press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press up to the horses' bridles for about 180 miles.
66Rv 15:1 Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues, for with them, God's wrath will be completed.
66Rv 15:2 I also saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had won the victory from the beast, his image, and the number of his name, were standing on the sea of glass with harps from God.
66Rv 15:3 They sang the song of God's servant Moses, and the song of the Lamb: Great and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations.
66Rv 15:4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, because all the nations will come and worship before You, because Your righteous acts have been revealed.
66Rv 15:5 After this I looked, and the heavenly sanctuary-- the tabernacle of testimony-- was opened.
66Rv 15:6 Out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean, bright linen, with gold sashes wrapped around their chests.
66Rv 15:7 One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
66Rv 15:8 Then the sanctuary was filled with smoke from God's glory and from His power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth."
66Rv 16:2 The first went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and severely painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
66Rv 16:3 The second poured out his bowl into the sea. It turned to blood like a dead man's, and all life in the sea died.
66Rv 16:4 The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
66Rv 16:5 I heard the angel of the waters say: You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, for You have decided these things.
66Rv 16:6 Because they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, You also gave them blood to drink; they deserve it!
66Rv 16:7 Then I heard someone from the altar say: Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.
66Rv 16:8 The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun. He was given the power to burn people with fire,
66Rv 16:9 and people were burned by the intense heat. So they blasphemed the name of God who had the power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give Him glory.
66Rv 16:10 The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues from pain
66Rv 16:11 and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, yet they did not repent of their actions.
66Rv 16:12 The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66Rv 16:13 Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [coming] from the dragon's mouth, from the beast's mouth, and from the mouth of the false prophet.
66Rv 16:14 For they are spirits of demons performing signs, who travel to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for the battle of the great day of God, the Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 "Look, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who is alert and remains clothed so that he may not go naked, and they see his shame."
66Rv 16:16 So they assembled them at the place called in Hebrew Armagedon.
66Rv 16:17 Then the seventh poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the sanctuary, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
66Rv 16:18 There were lightnings, rumblings, and thunders. And a severe earthquake occurred like no other since man has been on the earth-- so great was the quake.
66Rv 16:19 The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the Great was remembered in God's presence; He gave her the cup filled with the wine of His fierce anger.
66Rv 16:20 Every island fled, and the mountains disappeared.
66Rv 16:21 Enormous hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from heaven on the people, and they blasphemed God for the plague of hail because that plague was extremely severe.
66Rv 17:1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me: "Come, I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters.
66Rv 17:2 The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those who live on the earth became drunk on the wine of her sexual immorality."
66Rv 17:3 So he carried me away in the Spirit to a desert. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names, having seven heads and 10 horns.
66Rv 17:4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She had a gold cup in her hand filled with everything vile and with the impurities of her prostitution.
66Rv 17:5 On her forehead a cryptic name was written: BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE VILE THINGS OF THE EARTH
66Rv 17:6 Then I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of the saints and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. When I saw her, I was utterly astounded.
66Rv 17:7 Then the angel said to me, "Why are you astounded? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and of the beast, with the seven heads and the 10 horns, that carries her.
66Rv 17:8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss and go to destruction. Those who live on the earth whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be astounded when they see the beast that was, and is not, and will be present [again].
66Rv 17:9 "Here is the mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated.
66Rv 17:10 They are also seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain for a little while.
66Rv 17:11 The beast that was and is not, is himself the eighth, yet is of the seven and goes to destruction.
66Rv 17:12 The 10 horns you saw are 10 kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.
66Rv 17:13 These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
66Rv 17:14 These will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those with him are called and elect and faithful."
66Rv 17:15 He also said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute was seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
66Rv 17:16 The 10 horns you saw, and the beast, will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh, and burn her up with fire.
66Rv 17:17 For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His plan by having one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast until God's words are accomplished.
66Rv 17:18 And the woman you saw is the great city that has an empire over the kings of the earth."
66Rv 18:1 After this I saw another angel with great authority coming down from heaven, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
66Rv 18:2 He cried in a mighty voice: It has fallen, Babylon the Great has fallen! She has become a dwelling for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, and a haunt for every unclean and despicable beast.
66Rv 18:3 For all the nations have drunk the wine of her sexual immorality, which brings wrath. The kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown wealthy from her excessive luxury.
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven: Come out of her, My people, so that you will not share in her sins, or receive any of her plagues.
66Rv 18:5 For her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
66Rv 18:6 Pay her back the way she also paid, and double it according to her works. In the cup in which she mixed, mix a double portion for her.
66Rv 18:7 As much as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, give her that much torment and grief. Because she says in her heart, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never see grief,'
66Rv 18:8 therefore her plagues will come in one day-- death, and grief, and famine. She will be burned up with fire, because the Lord God who judges her is mighty.
66Rv 18:9 The kings of the earth who have committed sexual immorality and lived luxuriously with her will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning.
66Rv 18:10 They stand far off in fear of her torment, saying: Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in a single hour your judgment has come.
66Rv 18:11 The merchants of the earth will also weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their merchandise any longer--
66Rv 18:12 merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine fabrics of linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of fragrant wood products; objects of ivory; objects of expensive wood, brass, iron, and marble;
66Rv 18:13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, olive oil, fine wheat flour, and grain; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human bodies and souls.
66Rv 18:14 The fruit you craved has left you. All your splendid and glamorous things are gone; they will never find them again.
66Rv 18:15 The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
66Rv 18:16 saying: Woe, woe, the great city, clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls;
66Rv 18:17 because in a single hour such fabulous wealth was destroyed! And every shipmaster, seafarer, the sailors, and all who do business by sea, stood far off
66Rv 18:18 as they watched the smoke from her burning and kept crying out: "Who is like the great city?"
66Rv 18:19 They threw dust on their heads and kept crying out, weeping, and mourning: Woe, woe, the great city, where all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her wealth; because in a single hour she was destroyed.
66Rv 18:20 Rejoice over her, heaven, and you saints, apostles, and prophets, because God has executed your judgment on her!
66Rv 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying: In this way, Babylon the great city will be thrown down violently and never be found again.
66Rv 18:22 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again; no craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again; the sound of a mill will never be heard in you again;
66Rv 18:23 the light of a lamp will never shine in you again; and the voice of a groom and bride will never be heard in you again. [All this will happen] because your merchants were the nobility of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery,
66Rv 18:24 and the blood of prophets and saints, and all those slaughtered on earth, was found in you.
66Rv 19:1 After this I heard something like the loud voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying: Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,
66Rv 19:2 because His judgments are true and righteous, because He has judged the notorious prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality; and He has avenged the blood of His servants that was on her hands.
66Rv 19:3 A second time they said: Hallelujah! Her smoke ascends forever and ever!
66Rv 19:4 Then the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who is seated on the throne, saying: Amen! Hallelujah!
66Rv 19:5 A voice came from the throne, saying: Praise our God, all you His servants, you who fear Him, both small and great!
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters, and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying: Hallelujah-- because our Lord God, the Almighty, has begun to reign!
66Rv 19:7 Let us be glad, rejoice, and give Him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself.
66Rv 19:8 She was permitted to wear fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.
66Rv 19:9 Then he said to me, "Write: Blessed are those invited to the marriage feast of the Lamb!" He also said to me, "These words of God are true."
66Rv 19:10 Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers who have the testimony about Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66Rv 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse! Its rider is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.
66Rv 19:12 His eyes were like a fiery flame, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knows except Himself.
66Rv 19:13 He wore a robe stained with blood, and His name is called the Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 The armies that were in heaven followed Him on white horses, wearing pure white linen.
66Rv 19:15 From His mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it He might strike the nations. He will shepherd them with an iron scepter. He will also trample the winepress of the fierce anger of God, the Almighty.
66Rv 19:16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS
66Rv 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
66Rv 19:18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of their riders, and the flesh of everyone, both free and slave, small and great."
66Rv 19:19 Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and against His army.
66Rv 19:20 But the beast was taken prisoner, and along with him the false prophet, who had performed signs on his authority, by which he deceived those who accepted the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
66Rv 19:21 The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
66Rv 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
66Rv 20:2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years.
66Rv 20:3 He threw him into the abyss, closed it, and put a seal on it so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the 1,000 years were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.
66Rv 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. [I] also [saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God's word, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with the Messiah for 1,000 years.
66Rv 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
66Rv 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over these, but they will be priests of God and the Messiah, and they will reign with Him for 1,000 years.
66Rv 20:7 When the 1,000 years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison
66Rv 20:8 and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the sea.
66Rv 20:9 They came up over the surface of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the saints, the beloved city. Then fire came down from heaven and consumed them.
66Rv 20:10 The Devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66Rv 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and One seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from His presence, and no place was found for them.
66Rv 20:12 I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged according to their works by what was written in the books.
66Rv 20:13 Then the sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead; all were judged according to their works.
66Rv 20:14 Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
66Rv 20:15 And anyone not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea existed no longer.
66Rv 21:2 I also saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 Then I heard a loud voice from the throne: Look! God's dwelling is with men, and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will exist no longer; grief, crying, and pain will exist no longer, because the previous things have passed away.
66Rv 21:5 Then the One seated on the throne said, "Look! I am making everything new." He also said, "Write, because these words are faithful and true."
66Rv 21:6 And He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to the thirsty from the spring of living water as a gift.
66Rv 21:7 The victor will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son.
66Rv 21:8 But the cowards, unbelievers, vile, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars-- their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."
66Rv 21:9 Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me: "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66Rv 21:10 He then carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
66Rv 21:11 arrayed with God's glory. Her radiance was like a very precious stone, like a jasper stone, bright as crystal.
66Rv 21:12 [The city] had a massive high wall, with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; [on the gates], names were inscribed, the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.
66Rv 21:13 There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
66Rv 21:14 The city wall had 12 foundations, and on them were the 12 names of the Lamb's 12 apostles.
66Rv 21:15 The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
66Rv 21:16 The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 stadia. Its length, width, and height are equal.
66Rv 21:17 Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used.
66Rv 21:18 The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass.
66Rv 21:19 The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
66Rv 21:20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 The 12 gates are 12 pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The broad street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
66Rv 21:22 I did not see a sanctuary in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its sanctuary.
66Rv 21:23 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because God's glory illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
66Rv 21:24 The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
66Rv 21:25 Each day its gates will never close because it will never be night there.
66Rv 21:26 They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
66Rv 21:27 Nothing profane will ever enter it: no one who does what is vile or false, but only those written in the Lamb's book of life.
66Rv 22:1 Then he showed me the river of living water, sparkling like crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66Rv 22:2 down the middle of the broad street [of the city]. On both sides of the river was the tree of life bearing 12 kinds of fruit, producing its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree are for healing the nations,
66Rv 22:3 and there will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will serve Him.
66Rv 22:4 They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 Night will no longer exist, and people will not need lamplight or sunlight, because the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign forever and ever.
66Rv 22:6 Then he said to me, "These words are faithful and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show His servants what must quickly take place."
66Rv 22:7 "Look, I am coming quickly! Blessed is the one who keeps the prophetic words of this book."
66Rv 22:8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me.
66Rv 22:9 But he said to me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow slave with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words of this book. Worship God."
66Rv 22:10 He also said to me, "Don't seal the prophetic words of this book, because the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 Let the unrighteous go on in unrighteousness; let the filthy go on being made filthy; let the righteous go on in righteousness; and let the holy go on being made holy."
66Rv 22:12 "Look! I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me to repay each person according to what he has done.
66Rv 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
66Rv 22:14 "Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates.
66Rv 22:15 Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to attest these things to you for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright Morning Star."
66Rv 22:17 Both the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" Anyone who hears should say, "Come!" And the one who is thirsty should come. Whoever desires should take the living water as a gift.
66Rv 22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
66Rv 22:19 And if anyone takes away from the words of this prophetic book, God will take away his share of the tree of life and the holy city, written in this book.
66Rv 22:20 He who testifies about these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
66Rv 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
