24
24Jr 1:1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests living in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
24Jr 1:2 The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.
24Jr 1:3 It also came throughout the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
24Jr 1:4 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 1:5 I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born. I appointed you a prophet to the nations.
24Jr 1:6 But I protested, "Oh no, Lord God! Look, I don't know how to speak since I am [only] a youth."
24Jr 1:7 Then the LORD said to me: Do not say: I am [only] a youth, for you will go to everyone I send you to and speak whatever I tell you.
24Jr 1:8 Do not be afraid of anyone, for I will be with you to deliver you. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 1:9 Then the LORD reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and told me: Look, I have filled your mouth with My words.
24Jr 1:10 See, today I have set you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and demolish, to build and plant.
24Jr 1:11 Then the word of the LORD came to me, asking, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I replied, "I see a branch of an almond tree."
24Jr 1:12 The LORD said to me, "You have seen correctly, for I watch over My word to accomplish it."
24Jr 1:13 Again the word of the LORD came to me inquiring, "What do you see?" And I replied, "I see a boiling pot, its mouth tilted from the north [to the south]."
24Jr 1:14 Then the LORD said to me, "Disaster will be poured out from the north on all who live in the land.
24Jr 1:15 Indeed, I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north." [This is] the LORD's declaration. They will come, and each [king] will set up his throne at the entrance to Jerusalem's gates. They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah.
24Jr 1:16 "I will pronounce My judgments against them for all the evil they did when they abandoned Me to burn incense to other gods and to worship the works of their own hands.
24Jr 1:17 "Now, get ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them or I will cause you to cower before them.
24Jr 1:18 Today, I am the One who has made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land-- against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the population.
24Jr 1:19 They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 2:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 2:2 "Go and announce directly to Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: I remember the loyalty of your youth, your love as a bride-- how you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
24Jr 2:3 Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of His harvest. All who ate of it found themselves guilty; disaster came on them." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 2:4 Hear the word of the LORD, house of Jacob and all families of the house of Israel.
24Jr 2:5 Here is what the LORD says: What fault did your fathers find in Me that they went so far from Me, followed worthless idols, and became worthless themselves?
24Jr 2:6 They stopped asking: Where is the LORD who brought us from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, through a land of drought and darkness, a land no one traveled through and where no one lived?
24Jr 2:7 I brought you to a fertile land to eat its fruit and bounty, but after you entered, you defiled My land; you made My inheritance detestable.
24Jr 2:8 The priests quit asking: Where is the LORD? The experts in the law no longer knew Me, and the rulers rebelled against Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and followed useless idols.
24Jr 2:9 Therefore, I will bring a case against you again. [This is] the LORD's declaration. I will bring a case against your children's children.
24Jr 2:10 Cross over to Cyprusand take a look. Send [someone] to Kedar and consider carefully; see if there has ever been anything like this:
24Jr 2:11 Has a nation [ever] exchanged its gods? (but they were not gods!) Yet My people have exchanged their Glory for useless idols.
24Jr 2:12 Be horrified at this, heavens; be shocked and utterly appalled. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 2:13 For My people have committed a double evil: They have abandoned Me, the fountain of living water, and dug cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.
24Jr 2:14 Is Israel a slave? Was he born into slavery? Why else has he become a prey?
24Jr 2:15 The young lions have roared at him; they have roared loudly. They have laid waste his land. His cities are in ruins, without inhabitants.
24Jr 2:16 The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have also broken your skull.
24Jr 2:17 Have you not brought this on yourself by abandoning the LORD your God while He was leading you along the way?
24Jr 2:18 Now what will you gain by traveling along the way to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? What will you gain by traveling along the way to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24Jr 2:19 Your own evil will discipline you; your own apostasies will reprimand you. Think it over and see how evil and bitter it is for you to abandon the LORD your God and to have no fear of Me. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts.
24Jr 2:20 For long ago I broke your yoke; I tore off your fetters. You insisted: I will not serve! On every high hill and under every leafy tree you lie down [like] a prostitute.
24Jr 2:21 I planted you, a choice vine from the very best seed. How then could you turn into a degenerate, foreign vine?
24Jr 2:22 Even if you wash with lye and use a great amount of soap, the stain of your guilt is still in front of Me. [This is] the Lord GOD's declaration.
24Jr 2:23 How can you protest: I am not defiled; I have not followed the Baals? Look at your behavior in the valley; acknowledge what you have done. [You are] a swift young camel twisting and turning on her way,
24Jr 2:24 a wild donkey at home in the wilderness. She sniffs the wind in the heat of her desire. Who can control her passion? All who look for her will not become tired; they will find her in her mating season.
24Jr 2:25 Keep your feet from going bare and your throat from thirst. But you say: It's hopeless; I love strangers, and I will continue to follow them.
24Jr 2:26 Like the shame of a thief when he is caught, so the house of Israel has been put to shame. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets
24Jr 2:27 say to a tree: You are my father, and to a stone: You gave birth to me. For they have turned their back to Me and not their face, but in their time of disaster they beg: Rise up and save us!
24Jr 2:28 But where are your gods you made for yourself? Let them rise up and save you in your time of disaster if they can, for your gods are as numerous as your cities, Judah.
24Jr 2:29 Why do you bring a case against Me? All of you have rebelled against Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 2:30 I have struck down your children in vain; they would not accept discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a ravaging lion.
24Jr 2:31 [Evil] generation, pay attention to the word of the LORD! Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of dense darkness? Why do My people claim: We will go where we want; we will no longer come to You?
24Jr 2:32 Can a young woman forget her jewelry or a bride her wedding sash? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.
24Jr 2:33 How skillfully you pursue love; you also teach evil women your ways.
24Jr 2:34 Moreover, your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor. You did not catch them breaking and entering. But in spite of all these things
24Jr 2:35 you claim: I am innocent. His anger is sure to turn away from me. But I will certainly judge you because you have said: I have not sinned.
24Jr 2:36 How unstable you are, constantly changing your way! You will be put to shame by Egypt just as you were put to shame by Assyria.
24Jr 2:37 Moreover, you will be led out from here with your hands on your head since the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not succeed even with their help.
24Jr 3:1 If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to marry another, can he ever return to her? Wouldn't such a land become totally defiled? But you! You have played the prostitute with many partners-- can you return to Me? [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 3:2 Look to the barren heights and see. Where have you not been immoral? You sat waiting for them beside the highways like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
24Jr 3:3 This is why the showers haven't come-- why there has been no spring rain. You have the brazen look of a prostitute and refuse to be ashamed.
24Jr 3:4 Have you not lately called Me: My Father, my youthful companion?
24Jr 3:5 Will He bear a grudge forever? Will He be endlessly infuriated? This is what you have spoken and done, the evil you are capable of.
24Jr 3:6 In the days of King Josiah the LORD asked me, "Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has ascended every high hill and gone under every green tree to prostitute herself there.
24Jr 3:7 I thought: After she has done all these things, she will return to Me. But she didn't return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
24Jr 3:8 I observed that it was because unfaithful Israel had committed adultery that I had sent her away and had given her a certificate of divorce. Nevertheless, her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid but also went and prostituted herself.
24Jr 3:9 Indifferent to her prostitution, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and tree.
24Jr 3:10 Yet in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah didn't return to Me with all her heart-- only in pretense." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 3:11 The LORD announced to me, "Unfaithful Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
24Jr 3:12 Go, proclaim these words to the north, and say: Return, unfaithful Israel. [This is] the LORD's declaration. I will not look on you with anger, for I am unfailing in My love. [This is] the LORD's declaration. I will not be angry forever.
24Jr 3:13 Only acknowledge your guilt-- you have rebelled against the LORD your God. You have scattered your favors to strangers under every green tree and have not obeyed My voice. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 3:14 "Return, you faithless children"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "for I am your master, and I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
24Jr 3:15 I will give you shepherds who are loyal to Me,and they will shepherd you with knowledge and skill.
24Jr 3:16 When you multiply and increase in the land, in those days"-- the LORD's declaration-- "no one will say any longer: The ark of the LORD's covenant. It will never come to mind, and no one will remember or miss it. It will never again be made.
24Jr 3:17 At that time Jerusalem will be called, The LORD's Throne, and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD in Jerusalem. They will cease to follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
24Jr 3:18 In those days the house of Judah will join with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land I have given your ancestors to inherit."
24Jr 3:19 I thought: How I long to make you [My] sons and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations. I thought: You will call Me, my Father, and never turn away from Me.
24Jr 3:20 However, as a woman may betray her lover, so you have betrayed Me, house of Israel. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 3:21 A sound is heard on the barren heights, the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy, for they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God.
24Jr 3:22 Return, you faithless children. I will heal your unfaithfulness. "Here we are, coming to You, for You are the LORD our God.
24Jr 3:23 Surely, falsehood comes from the hills, commotion from the mountains, but the salvation of Israel is only in the LORD our God.
24Jr 3:24 From the time of our youth the shameful one has consumed what our fathers have worked for-- their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
24Jr 3:25 Let us lie down in our shame; let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our fathers, from the time of our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
24Jr 4:1 If you return, Israel-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- [if] you return to Me, if you remove your detestable idols from My presence and do not waver,
24Jr 4:2 if you swear, As the LORD lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will be blessed by Him and will pride themselves in Him.
24Jr 4:3 For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: Break up the unplowed ground; do not sow among the thorns.
24Jr 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to extinguish [it] because of your evil deeds.
24Jr 4:5 Declare in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: Blow the ram's horn throughout the land. Cry out loudly and say: Assemble yourselves, and let's flee to the fortified cities.
24Jr 4:6 Lift up a signal flag toward Zion. Run for cover! Don't stand still! For I am bringing disaster from the north-- a great destruction.
24Jr 4:7 A lion has gone up from his thicket; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his lair to make your land a waste. Your cities will be reduced to uninhabited ruins.
24Jr 4:8 Because of this, put on sackcloth; mourn and wail, for the LORD's burning anger has not turned away from us.
24Jr 4:9 "On that day"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "the king and the officials will lose their courage. The priests will tremble in fear, and the prophets will be scared speechless."
24Jr 4:10 I said, "Oh no, Lord God, You have certainly deceived this people and Jerusalem, by announcing, 'You will have peace,' while a sword is at our throats."
24Jr 4:11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A searing wind [blows] from the barren heights in the wilderness on the way to My dear people. [It comes] not to winnow or to sift;
24Jr 4:12 a wind too strong for this comes at My call. Now I will also pronounce judgments against them."
24Jr 4:13 Look, he advances like clouds; his chariots are like a storm. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!
24Jr 4:14 Wash the evil from your heart, Jerusalem, so that you will be delivered. How long will you harbor malicious thoughts within you?
24Jr 4:15 For a voice announces from Dan, proclaiming malice from Mount Ephraim.
24Jr 4:16 Warn the nations: Look! Proclaim to Jerusalem: Those who besiege are coming from a distant land; they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
24Jr 4:17 They have her surrounded like those who guard a field, because she has rebelled against Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 4:18 Your way of life and your actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. It is very bitter, because it has reached your heart!
24Jr 4:19 My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in agony! Oh, the pain in my heart! My heart pounds; I cannot be silent. For you, my soul, have heard the sound of the ram's horn-- the shout of battle.
24Jr 4:20 Disaster after disaster is reported, for the whole land is destroyed. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my tent curtains, in a moment.
24Jr 4:21 How long must I see the signal flag and hear the sound of the ram's horn?
24Jr 4:22 For My people are fools; they do not know Me. They are foolish children, without understanding. They are skilled in doing what is evil, but they do not know how to do what is good.
24Jr 4:23 I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty. [I looked] to the heavens, and their light was gone.
24Jr 4:24 I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills shook.
24Jr 4:25 I looked, and no man was left; all the birds of the sky had fled.
24Jr 4:26 I looked, and the fertile field was a wilderness. All its cities were torn down because of the LORD and His burning anger.
24Jr 4:27 For this is what the LORD says: The whole land will be a desolation, but I will not finish it off.
24Jr 4:28 Because of this, the earth will mourn; the skies above will grow dark. I have spoken; I have planned, and I will not relent or turn back from it.
24Jr 4:29 Every city flees at the sound of the horseman and the archer. They enter the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every city is abandoned; no inhabitant is left.
24Jr 4:30 And you devastated one, what are you doing that you dress yourself in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with gold jewelry, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? You beautify yourself for nothing. Your lovers reject you; they want to take your life.
24Jr 4:31 I hear a cry like a woman in labor, [a cry of] anguish like one bearing her first child. The cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands: Woe is me, for my life is weary because of the murderers!
24Jr 5:1 Roam through the streets of Jerusalem. Look and take note; search in her squares. If you find a single person, anyone who acts justly, who seeks to be faithful, then I will forgive her.
24Jr 5:2 When they say, "As the LORD lives," they are swearing falsely.
24Jr 5:3 LORD, don't Your eyes [look for] faithfulness? You have struck them, but they felt no pain. You finished them off, but they refused to accept discipline. They made their faces harder than rock, and they refused to return.
24Jr 5:4 Then I thought: They are just the poor; they have played the fool. For they don't understand the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.
24Jr 5:5 I will go to the powerful and speak to them. Surely they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God. However, these also had broken the yoke and torn off the fetters.
24Jr 5:6 Therefore, a lion from the forest will strike them down. A wolf from an arid plain will ravage them. A leopard keeps watch over their cities. Anyone who leaves them will be torn to pieces because their rebellious acts are many, their unfaithful deeds numerous.
24Jr 5:7 Why should I forgive you? Your children have abandoned Me and sworn by those who are not gods. I satisfied their needs, yet they committed adultery; they gashed themselves at the prostitute's house.
24Jr 5:8 They are well-fed, eager stallions, each neighing after someone else's wife.
24Jr 5:9 Should I not punish them for these things? [This is] the LORD's declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
24Jr 5:10 Go up among her vineyard terraces and destroy them, but do not finish them off. Prune away her shoots, for they do not belong to the LORD.
24Jr 5:11 They, the house of Israel and the house of Judah, have dealt very treacherously with Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 5:12 They have contradicted the LORD and insisted, "It won't happen. Harm won't come to us; we won't see sword or famine."
24Jr 5:13 The prophets become [only] wind, for the [LORD's] word is not in them. This will in fact happen to them.
24Jr 5:14 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Hosts says: Because you have spoken this word, I am going to make My words become fire in your mouth. These people are the wood, and the fire will consume them.
24Jr 5:15 I am about to bring a nation from far away against you, house of Israel. [This is] the LORD's declaration. It is an established nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know and whose speech you do not understand.
24Jr 5:16 Their quiver is like an open grave; they are all mighty warriors.
24Jr 5:17 They will consume your harvest and your food. They will consume your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will consume your vines and your fig trees. They will destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
24Jr 5:18 "But even in those days"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "I will not finish you off.
24Jr 5:19 When people ask: For what offense has the LORD our God done all these things to us? You will respond to them: Just as you abandoned Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
24Jr 5:20 "Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah, saying:
24Jr 5:21 Hear this, you foolish and senseless people. They have eyes, but they don't see. They have ears, but they don't hear.
24Jr 5:22 Do you not fear Me? [This is] the LORD's declaration. Do you not tremble before Me, the One who set the sand as the boundary of the sea, an enduring barrier that it cannot cross? The waves surge, but they cannot prevail. They roar but cannot pass over it.
24Jr 5:23 But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned aside and have gone away.
24Jr 5:24 They have not said to themselves: Let's fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain, both early and late, in its season, who guarantees to us the fixed weeks of the harvest.
24Jr 5:25 Your guilty acts have diverted these things [from you]. Your sins have withheld [My] bounty from you,
24Jr 5:26 for wicked men live among My people. They watch like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
24Jr 5:27 Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. Therefore they have grown powerful and rich.
24Jr 5:28 They have become fat and sleek. They have also excelled in evil matters. They have not taken up cases, such as the case of orphans, so they might prosper, and they have not defended the rights of the needy.
24Jr 5:29 Should I not punish them for these things? [This is] the LORD's declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
24Jr 5:30 A horrible, terrible thing has taken place in the land.
24Jr 5:31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority. My people love it like this. But what will you do at the end of it?
24Jr 6:1 Run for cover, Benjaminites, out of Jerusalem! Sound the ram's horn in Tekoa; raise a smoke signal over Beth-haccherem, for disaster threatens from the north, even great destruction.
24Jr 6:2 [Though she is] beautiful and delicate, I will destroy Daughter Zion.
24Jr 6:3 Shepherds and their flocks will come against her; they will pitch [their] tents all around her. Each will pasture his own portion.
24Jr 6:4 Set [them] apart for war against her; rise up, let's attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day is passing; the evening shadows grow long.
24Jr 6:5 Rise up, let's attack by night. Let us destroy her fortresses."
24Jr 6:6 For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: Cut down the trees; raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This city must be punished. There is nothing but oppression within her.
24Jr 6:7 As a well gushes out its water, so she pours forth her evil. Violence and destruction resound in her. Sickness and wounds keep coming to My attention.
24Jr 6:8 Be warned, Jerusalem, or I will be torn away from you; I will make you a desolation, a land devoid of inhabitant.
24Jr 6:9 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Glean as thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel. Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches.
24Jr 6:10 Who can I speak to and give such a warning that they will listen? Look, their ear is uncircumcised, so they cannot pay attention. See, the word of the LORD has become contemptible to them-- they find no pleasure in it.
24Jr 6:11 But I am full of the LORD's wrath; I am tired of holding it back. Pour [it] out on the children in the street, on the gang of young men as well. For both husband and wife will be captured, the old with the very old.
24Jr 6:12 Their houses will be turned over to others, [their] fields and wives as well, for I will stretch out My hand against the residents of the land. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 6:13 For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is gaining profit unjustly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 6:14 They have treated My people's brokenness superficially, claiming: Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
24Jr 6:15 Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren't at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse, says the LORD.
24Jr 6:16 This is what the LORD says: Stand by the roadways and look. Ask about the ancient paths: Which is the way to what is good? Then take it and find rest for yourselves. But they protested: We won't!
24Jr 6:17 I appointed watchmen over you [and said:] Listen for the sound of the ram's horn. But they protested: We won't listen!
24Jr 6:18 Therefore listen, you nations and you witnesses, learn what [the charge] is against them.
24Jr 6:19 Listen, earth! I am about to bring disaster on these people, the fruit of their own plotting, for they have paid no attention to My word. They have rejected My law.
24Jr 6:20 What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please Me.
24Jr 6:21 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am going to place stumbling blocks before these people; fathers and sons together will stumble over them; friends and neighbors will [also] perish.
24Jr 6:22 This is what the LORD says: Look, an army is coming from a northern land; a great nation will be awakened from the remote regions of the earth.
24Jr 6:23 They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Zion.
24Jr 6:24 We have heard about it, and we are discouraged. Distress has seized us-- pain like a woman in labor.
24Jr 6:25 Don't go out to the fields; don't walk on the road. For the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.
24Jr 6:26 My dear people, dress yourselves in sackcloth and roll in the dust. Mourn [as you would for] an only son, a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come on us.
24Jr 6:27 I have appointed you to be an assayer among My people-- a refiner-- so you may know and assay their way of life.
24Jr 6:28 All are stubborn rebels spreading slander. [They are] bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt.
24Jr 6:29 The bellows blow, blasting the lead with fire. The refining is completely in vain; the evil ones are not separated out.
24Jr 6:30 They are called rejected silver, for the LORD has rejected them.
24Jr 7:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 7:2 "Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD and there call out this word: Hear the word of the LORD, all [you people] of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD.
24Jr 7:3 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Correct your ways and your deeds, and I will allow you to live in this place.
24Jr 7:4 Do not trust deceitful words, chanting: This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 7:5 Instead, if you really change your ways and your actions, if you act justly toward one another,
24Jr 7:6 if you no longer oppress the alien, the fatherless, and the widow and no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods, bringing harm on yourselves,
24Jr 7:7 I will allow you to live in this place, the land I gave to your ancestors forever and ever.
24Jr 7:8 [But] look, you keep trusting in deceitful words that cannot help.
24Jr 7:9 "Do you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known?
24Jr 7:10 Then do you come and stand before Me in this house called by My name and insist: We are safe? As a result, you are free to continue doing all these detestable acts!
24Jr 7:11 Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I too have seen [it]." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 7:12 "But return to My place that was at Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at first. See what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel.
24Jr 7:13 Now, because you have done all these things"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "and because I have spoken to you time and time again but you wouldn't listen, and I have called to you, but you wouldn't answer,
24Jr 7:14 what I did to Shiloh I will do to the house that is called by My name-- the house in which you trust-- the place that I gave you and your ancestors.
24Jr 7:15 I will drive you from My presence, just as I drove out all of your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.
24Jr 7:16 "As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not offer a cry or a prayer on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you.
24Jr 7:17 Don't you see how they behave in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 7:18 The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven,and they pour out drink offerings to other gods so that they provoke Me to anger.
24Jr 7:19 But are they really provoking Me?" [This is] the LORD's declaration. "Isn't it they themselves [being provoked] to disgrace?"
24Jr 7:20 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "Look, My anger-- My burning wrath-- is about to be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the tree of the field, and on the fruit of the ground. My wrath will burn and not be quenched."
24Jr 7:21 This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices, and eat the meat yourselves,
24Jr 7:22 for when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice.
24Jr 7:23 However, I did give them this command: Obey Me, and then I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must walk in every way I command you so that it may go well with you."
24Jr 7:24 Yet they didn't listen or pay attention but walked according to their own advice and according to their own stubborn, evil heart. They went backward and not forward.
24Jr 7:25 Since the day your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent all My servants the prophets to you time and time again.
24Jr 7:26 However, they wouldn't listen to Me or pay attention but became obstinate;they did more evil than their ancestors.
24Jr 7:27 "When you speak all these things to them, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you.
24Jr 7:28 You must therefore declare to them: This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not accept discipline. Truth has perished-- it has disappeared from their mouths.
24Jr 7:29 Cut off the hair of your sacred vowand throw it away. Raise up a dirge on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned the generation under His wrath.
24Jr 7:30 "For the Judeans have done what is evil in My sight." [This is] the LORD's declaration. "They have set up their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and defiled it.
24Jr 7:31 They have built the high places of Tophethin the Valley of Hinnomin order to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, a thing I did not command; I never entertained the thought.
24Jr 7:32 "Therefore, take note! Days are coming"-- the LORD's declaration-- "when [this place] will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. Topheth will become a cemetery, because there will be no other burial place.
24Jr 7:33 The corpses of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land, with no one to scare them off.
24Jr 7:34 I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of the bridegroom and the bride, for the land will become a desolate waste.
24Jr 8:1 "At that time"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of her officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the residents of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves.
24Jr 8:2 They will be exposed to the sun, the moon, and the whole heavenly host, which they have loved, served, followed, pursued, and worshiped. [Their bones] will not be collected and buried but will become like manure on the surface of the soil.
24Jr 8:3 Death will be chosen over life by all the survivors of this evil family, those who remain wherever I have banished them." [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
24Jr 8:4 You are to say to them: This is what the LORD says: Do [people] fall and not get up again? If they turn away, do they not return?
24Jr 8:5 Why have these people turned away? Why is Jerusalem always turning away? They take hold of deceit; they refuse to return.
24Jr 8:6 I have paid careful attention. They do not speak what is right. No one regrets his evil, asking: What have I done? Everyone has stayed his course like a horse rushing into battle.
24Jr 8:7 Even the stork in the sky knows her seasons. The turtledove, swallow, and crane are aware of their migration, but My people do not know the requirements of the LORD.
24Jr 8:8 How can you claim: We are wise; the law of the LORD is with us? In fact, the lying pen of scribes has produced falsehood.
24Jr 8:9 The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and snared. They have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom do they really have?
24Jr 8:10 Therefore, I will give their wives to other men, their fields to new occupants, for from the least to the greatest, everyone is gaining profit unjustly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
24Jr 8:11 They have treated superficially the brokenness of My dear people, claiming: Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
24Jr 8:12 Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren't at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse, says the LORD.
24Jr 8:13 I will gather them and bring them to an end. [This is] the LORD's declaration. There will be no grapes on the vine, no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf will wither. Whatever I have given them will be lost to them.
24Jr 8:14 Why are we just sitting here? Gather together; let us enter the fortified cities and there suffer our fate, for the LORD our God has condemned us. He has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 8:15 We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
24Jr 8:16 From Dan is heard the snorting of horses. At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds, the whole land quakes. They come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all its residents.
24Jr 8:17 Indeed, I am about to send snakes among you, poisonous vipers that cannot be charmed. They will bite you. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 8:18 My joy has flown away; grief has settled on me. My heart is sick.
24Jr 8:19 Listen-- the cry of my dear people from a far away land: Is the LORD no longer in Zion, her King not in her midst? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven images, with their worthless foreign idols?
24Jr 8:20 Harvest has passed, summer has ended, but we have not been saved.
24Jr 8:21 I am broken by the brokenness of my dear people. I mourn; horror has taken hold of me.
24Jr 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? So why has the healing of my dear people not come about?
24Jr 9:1  If my head were water, my eyes a fountain of tears, I would weep day and night over the slain of my dear people.
24Jr 9:2  If only I had a traveler's lodging place in the wilderness, I would abandon my people and depart from them, for they are all adulterers, a solemn assembly of treacherous people.
24Jr 9:3 They bent their tongues [like] their bows; lies and not faithfulness prevail in the land, for they proceed from one evil to another, and they do not take Me into account. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 9:4 Everyone has to be on guard against his friend. Don't trust any brother, for every brother will certainly deceive, and every friend spread slander.
24Jr 9:5 Each one betrays his friend; no one tells the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they wear themselves out doing wrong.
24Jr 9:6 You live in [a world] of deception. In [their] deception they refuse to know Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 9:7 Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I am about to refine them and test them, for what else can I do because of My dear people?
24Jr 9:8 Their tongues are deadly arrows-- they speak deception. With his mouth a man speaks peaceably with his friend, but inwardly he sets up an ambush.
24Jr 9:9 Should I not punish them for these things? [This is] the LORD's declaration. Should I not take My revenge against a nation such as this?
24Jr 9:10 I will raise weeping and a lament over the mountains, a dirge over the wilderness grazing land, for they have been so scorched that no one passes through. The sound of cattle is no longer heard. From the birds of the sky to the animals, [everything] has fled-- they have gone away.
24Jr 9:11 I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a jackals' den. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, an uninhabited place.
24Jr 9:12 Who is the man wise enough to understand this? Who has the LORD spoken to, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a wilderness, so no one can pass through?
24Jr 9:13 The LORD said, "It is because they abandoned My law I set in front of them and did not obey My voice or walk according to it.
24Jr 9:14 Instead, they followed the stubbornness of their hearts and the Baals, as their fathers taught them."
24Jr 9:15 Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to feed this people wormwood and give them poisonous waters to drink.
24Jr 9:16 I will scatter them among nations that they and their fathers have not known. I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off."
24Jr 9:17 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Consider, and summon the women who mourn; send for the skillful women.
24Jr 9:18 Let them come quickly to raise a lament over us so that our eyes may overflow with tears, our eyelids soaked with weeping.
24Jr 9:19 For a sound of lamentation is heard from Zion: How devastated we are. We are greatly ashamed, for we have abandoned the land; our dwellings have been torn down.
24Jr 9:20 Now hear the word of the LORD, you women. Pay attention to the word of His mouth. Teach your daughters a lament and one another a dirge,
24Jr 9:21 for Death has climbed through our windows; it has entered our fortresses, cutting off children from the streets, young men from the squares.
24Jr 9:22 Speak as follows: This is what the LORD says: Human corpses will fall like manure on the surface of the field, like newly cut grain after the reaper with no one to gather [it].
24Jr 9:23 This is what the LORD says: The wise must not boast in his wisdom; the mighty must not boast in his might; the rich must not boast in his riches.
24Jr 9:24 But the one who boasts should boast in this, that he understands and knows Me-- that I am the LORD, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 9:25 "The days are coming"-- the LORD's declaration-- "when I will punish all the circumcised yet uncircumcised:
24Jr 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, all those who clip the hair on their temples and reside in the wilderness. All these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart."
24Jr 10:1 Hear the word that the LORD has spoken to you, house of Israel.
24Jr 10:2 This is what the LORD says: Do not learn the way of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, although the nations are terrified by them,
24Jr 10:3 for the customs of the peoples are worthless. Someone cuts down a tree from the forest; [it is] worked by the hands of a craftsman with a chisel.
24Jr 10:4 He decorates it with silver and gold. It is fastened with hammer and nails, so it won't totter.
24Jr 10:5 Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them for they can do no harm-- and they cannot do any good.
24Jr 10:6 LORD, there is no one like You. You are great; Your name is great in power.
24Jr 10:7 Who should not fear You, King of the nations? It is what You deserve. For among all the wise people of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one like You.
24Jr 10:8 They are both senseless and foolish, instructed by worthless idols [made of] wood!
24Jr 10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz from the hands of a goldsmith, the work of a craftsman. Their clothing is blue and purple, all the work of skilled artisans.
24Jr 10:10 But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and eternal King. The earth quakes at His wrath, and the nations cannot endure His rage.
24Jr 10:11 You are to say this to them: The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.
24Jr 10:12 He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding.
24Jr 10:13 When He thunders, the waters in the heavens are in turmoil, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
24Jr 10:14 Everyone is stupid and ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by [his] carved image, for his cast images are a lie; there is no breath in them.
24Jr 10:15 They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed.
24Jr 10:16 Jacob's Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
24Jr 10:17 Gather up your belongings from the ground, you who live under siege.
24Jr 10:18 For this is what the LORD says: Look, I am slinging out the land's residents at this time and bringing them such distress that they will feel it.
24Jr 10:19 Woe to me because of my brokenness-- I am severely wounded! I exclaimed, "This is my intense suffering, but I must bear it."
24Jr 10:20 My tent is destroyed; all my tent cords are snapped. My sons have departed from me and are no more. [I have] no one to pitch my tent again or to hang up my curtains.
24Jr 10:21 For the shepherds are stupid: they don't seek the LORD. Therefore they have not prospered, and their whole flock is scattered.
24Jr 10:22 Listen! A noise-- it is coming-- a great commotion from the land to the north. The cities of Judah will be made desolate, a jackals' den.
24Jr 10:23 I know, LORD, that a man's way of life is not his own; no one who walks determines his own steps.
24Jr 10:24 Discipline me, LORD, but with justice-- not in Your anger, or You will reduce me to nothing.
24Jr 10:25 Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don't recognize You and on the families that don't call on Your name, for they have consumed Jacob; they have consumed him and finished him off and made his homeland desolate.
24Jr 11:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 11:2 "Listen to the words of this covenant, and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:3 You must tell them: This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Let a curse be on the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,
24Jr 11:4 which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace. I declared: 'Obey Me, and do everything that I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God,'
24Jr 11:5 in order to establish the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give [them] a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is today." I answered, " Amen, LORD."
24Jr 11:6 The LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Obey the words of this covenant and carry them out.
24Jr 11:7 For I strongly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt until today, warning them time and time again: Obey My voice.
24Jr 11:8 Yet they would not obey or pay attention; each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant, because they had not done what I commanded [them] to do."
24Jr 11:9 The LORD said to me, "A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:10 They have returned to the sins of their ancestors who refused to obey My words and have followed other gods to worship them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke My covenant I made with their ancestors.
24Jr 11:11 "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring on them disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to Me, but I will not hear them.
24Jr 11:12 Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods they have been burning incense to, but they certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
24Jr 11:13 Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, Judah, and the altars you have set up to Shame-- altars to burn incense to Baal-- as numerous as the streets of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:14 "As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be listening when they call out to Me at the time of their disaster.
24Jr 11:15 What [right] does My beloved have to be in My house, having carried out so many evil schemes? Can holy meatprevent your disaster so you can rejoice?
24Jr 11:16 The LORD named you a flourishing olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. He has set fire to it, and its branches are consumed with a great roaring sound.
24Jr 11:17 "The LORD of Hosts who planted you has decreed disaster against you, because of the harm the house of Israel and the house of Judah brought on themselves, provoking Me to anger by burning incense to Baal."
24Jr 11:18 The LORD informed me, so I knew. Then You helped me to see their deeds,
24Jr 11:19 for I was like a docile lamb led to slaughter. I didn't know that they had devised plots against me: "Let's destroy the tree with its fruit; let's cut him off from the land of the living so that his name will no longer be remembered."
24Jr 11:20 But, LORD of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tests heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You.
24Jr 11:21 Therefore, here is what the LORD says concerning the people of Anathoth who want to take your life. They warn, "You must not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will certainly die at our hand."
24Jr 11:22 Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: "I am about to punish them. The young men will die by the sword; their sons and daughters will die by famine.
24Jr 11:23 They will have no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth [in] the year of their punishment."
24Jr 12:1 You will be righteous, LORD, even if I bring a case against You. Yet, I wish to contend with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? [Why] do the treacherous live at ease?
24Jr 12:2 You planted them, and they have taken root. They have grown and produced fruit. You are ever on their lips, but far from their conscience.
24Jr 12:3 As for You, You know me, LORD; You see me. You test whether my heart is with You. Drag the wicked away like sheep to slaughter, and set them apart for the day of killing.
24Jr 12:4 How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the evil of its residents, animals and birds have been swept away, for [the people] have said, "He cannot see what our end will be."
24Jr 12:5 If you have raced with runners and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, what will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
24Jr 12:6 Even your brothers-- your own father's household-- even they were treacherous to you; even they have cried out loudly after you. Do not have confidence in them, though they speak well of you.
24Jr 12:7 I have abandoned My house; I have deserted My inheritance. I have given the love of My life into the hand of her enemies.
24Jr 12:8 My inheritance has acted toward Me like a lion in the forest. She has roared against Me. Therefore, I hate her.
24Jr 12:9 Is My inheritance like a hyena to Me? Are birds of prey circling her? Go, gather all the wild animals; bring them to devour [her].
24Jr 12:10 Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My plot of land. They have turned My desirable plot into a desolate wasteland.
24Jr 12:11 They have made it a desolation. It mourns, desolate, before Me. All the land is desolate, but no one takes it to heart.
24Jr 12:12 Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come, for the LORD has a sword that devours from one end of the earth to the other. No one has peace.
24Jr 12:13 They have sown wheat but harvested thorns. They have exhausted themselves but have no profit. Be put to shame by your harvests because of the LORD's burning anger.
24Jr 12:14 This is what the LORD says: "Concerning all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people, Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
24Jr 12:15 After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land.
24Jr 12:16 If they will diligently learn the ways of My people-- to swear by My name, 'As the LORD lives,' just as they taught My people to swear by Baal-- they will be built up among My people.
24Jr 12:17 However, if they will not obey, then I will uproot and destroy that nation." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 13:1 This is what the LORD said to me: "Go and buy yourself linen underwear and put it on, but don't get it wet."
24Jr 13:2 So I bought underwear as the LORD instructed me and put it on.
24Jr 13:3 Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time:
24Jr 13:4 "Take the underwear that you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Euphrates River and hide it in a rocky crevice."
24Jr 13:5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
24Jr 13:6 A long time later the LORD said to me, "Go at once to the Euphrates and get the underwear that I commanded you to hide there."
24Jr 13:7 So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the underwear and got it from the place where I had hidden it, but it was ruined-- of no use whatsoever.
24Jr 13:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 13:9 "This is what the LORD says: Just like this I will ruin the great pride of both Judah and Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:10 These evil people, who refuse to listen to Me, who walk in the stubbornness of their own hearts, and who have followed other gods to serve and worship-- they will be like this underwear, of no use whatsoever.
24Jr 13:11 Just as underwear clings to one's waist, so I fastened the whole house of Israel and of Judah to Me"-- [this is the LORD's declaration]-- "so that they might be My people for My fame, praise, and glory, but they would not obey.
24Jr 13:12 "Say this to them: This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every jar should be filled with wine. Then they will respond to you: Don't we know that every jar should be filled with wine?
24Jr 13:13 And you will say to them, This is what the LORD says: I am about to fill all who live in this land-- the kings who reign for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the residents of Jerusalem-- with drunkenness.
24Jr 13:14 I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike"-- the LORD's declaration. "I will allow no mercy, pity, or compassion [to keep Me] from destroying them."
24Jr 13:15 Listen and pay attention. Do not be proud, for the LORD has spoken.
24Jr 13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God before He brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk. You wait for light, but He brings darkest gloom and makes thick darkness.
24Jr 13:17 But if you will not listen, my innermost being will weep in secret because of your pride. My eyes will overflow with tears, for the LORD's flock has been taken captive.
24Jr 13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother: Take a humble seat, for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads.
24Jr 13:19 The cities of the Negev are under siege; no one can help [them]. All of Judah has been taken into exile, taken completely into exile.
24Jr 13:20 Look up and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock entrusted to you, the sheep [that were] your pride?
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when He appoints close friends as leaders over you, ones you yourself trained? Won't labor pains seize you, as [they do] a woman in labor?
24Jr 13:22 And when you ask yourself: Why have these things happened to me?-- it is because of your great guilt that your skirts have been stripped off, your body ravished.
24Jr 13:23 Can the Cushite change his skin, or a leopard his spots? If so, you might be able to do what is good, you who are instructed in evil.
24Jr 13:24 I will scatter you like drifting chaff before the desert wind.
24Jr 13:25 This is your lot, what I have decreed for you-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- because you have forgotten Me and trusted in Falsehood.
24Jr 13:26 I will pull your skirts up over your face so that your shame might be seen.
24Jr 13:27 Your adulteries and your [lustful] neighings, your heinous prostitution on the hills, in the fields-- I have seen your detestable acts. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You are unclean-- for how long yet?
24Jr 14:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
24Jr 14:2 Judah mourns; her gates languish. [Her people] are on the ground in mourning; Jerusalem's cry rises up.
24Jr 14:3 Their nobles send their servants for water. They go to the cisterns; they find no water; their containers return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads.
24Jr 14:4 The ground is cracked since no rain [has fallen] on the land. The farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
24Jr 14:5 Even the doe in the field gives birth and abandons [her fawn] since there is no grass.
24Jr 14:6 Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights panting for air like jackals. Their eyes fail because there are no green plants.
24Jr 14:7 Though our guilt testifies against us, LORD, act for Your name's sake. Indeed, our rebellions are many; we have sinned against You.
24Jr 14:8 Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of distress, why are You like an alien in the land, like a traveler stopping only for the night?
24Jr 14:9 Why are You like a helpless man, like a warrior unable to save? Yet You are among us, LORD, and we are called by Your name. Don't leave us!
24Jr 14:10 This is what the LORD says concerning these people: Truly they love to wander; they never rest their feet. So the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their guilt and punish their sins.
24Jr 14:11 Then the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the well-being of these people.
24Jr 14:12 If they fast, I will not hear their cry of despair. If they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. Rather, I will finish them off by sword, famine, and plague."
24Jr 14:13 And I replied, "Oh no, Lord God! The prophets are telling them, 'You won't see sword or suffer famine. I will certainly give you true peace in this place.'"
24Jr 14:14 But the LORD said to me, "These prophets are prophesying a lie in My name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision, worthless divination, the deceit of their own minds.
24Jr 14:15 "Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, though I did not send them, and who say: There will never be sword or famine in this land: By sword and famine these prophets will meet their end.
24Jr 14:16 The people they are prophesying to will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them-- they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out their own evil on them."
24Jr 14:17 You are to speak this word to them: Let my eyes overflow with tears; day and night may [they] not stop, for the virgin daughter of my people has been destroyed by a great disaster, an extremely severe wound.
24Jr 14:18 If I go out to the field, look-- those slain by the sword! If I enter the city, look-- those ill from famine! For both prophet and priest travel to a land they do not know.
24Jr 14:19 Have You completely rejected Judah? Do You detest Zion? Why do You strike us with no hope of healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
24Jr 14:20 We acknowledge our wickedness, LORD, the guilt of our fathers; indeed, we have sinned against You.
24Jr 14:21 Because of Your name, don't despise [us]. Don't disdain Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us; do not break it.
24Jr 14:22 Can any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies alone give showers? Are You not the LORD our God? We therefore put our hope in You, for You have done all these things.
24Jr 15:1 Then the LORD said to me: "Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My compassions would not [reach out] to these people. Send them from My presence, and let them go.
24Jr 15:2 If they ask you: Where will we go? you must tell them: This is what the LORD says: Those [destined] for death, to death; those [destined] for the sword, to the sword. Those [destined] for famine, to famine; those [destined] for captivity, to captivity.
24Jr 15:3 "I will ordain four kinds [of judgment] for them"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land to devour and destroy.
24Jr 15:4 I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
24Jr 15:5 Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will show sympathy toward you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
24Jr 15:6 You have left Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration. You have turned your back, so I have stretched out My hand against you and destroyed you. I am tired of showing compassion.
24Jr 15:7 I scattered them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I made [them] childless; I destroyed My people. They would not turn from their ways.
24Jr 15:8 I made their widows more numerous than the sand of the seas. I brought against the mother of young men a destroyer at noon. I suddenly released on her agitation and terrors.
24Jr 15:9 The mother of seven grew faint; she breathed her [last] breath. Her sun set while it was still day; she was ashamed and humiliated. The rest of them I will give over to the sword in the presence of their enemies." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 15:10 Woe is me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man who incites dispute and conflict in all the land. I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me.
24Jr 15:11 The LORD said: Assuredly, I will set you free and care for you. Assuredly, I will intercede for you in a time of trouble, in your time of distress, with the enemy.
24Jr 15:12 Can anyone smash iron, iron from the north, or bronze?
24Jr 15:13 Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without cost, for all your sins, and within all your borders.
24Jr 15:14 Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for My anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.
24Jr 15:15 You know, LORD; remember me and take note of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In Your patience, don't take me away. Know that I suffer disgrace for Your honor.
24Jr 15:16 Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the joy of my heart, for I am called by Your name, LORD God of Hosts.
24Jr 15:17 I never sat with the band of revelers, and I did not celebrate [with them]. Because Your hand was [on me], I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation.
24Jr 15:18 Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You truly have become like a mirage to me-- water that is not reliable.
24Jr 15:19 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: If you return, I will restore you; you will stand in My presence. And if you speak noble [words], rather than worthless ones, you will be My spokesman. It is they who must return to you; you must not return to them.
24Jr 15:20 Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 15:21 I will deliver you from the power of evil people and redeem you from the control of the ruthless.
24Jr 16:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 16:2 "You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.
24Jr 16:3 For this is what the LORD says concerning sons and daughters born in this place as well as concerning the mothers who bear them and the fathers who father them in this land:
24Jr 16:4 They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like manure on the face of the earth. They will be finished off by sword and famine. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
24Jr 16:5 "For this is what the LORD says: Don't enter a house where a mourning feast is taking place. Don't go to lament or sympathize with them, for I have removed My peace from these people"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "[as well as My] faithful love and compassion.
24Jr 16:6 Both great and small will die in this land without burial. No lament will be made for them, nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them.
24Jr 16:7 Food won't be provided for the mourner to comfort him because of the dead. A cup of consolation won't be given him because of [the loss of] his father or mother.
24Jr 16:8 You must not enter the house where feasting is taking place to sit with them to eat and drink.
24Jr 16:9 For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to eliminate from this place, before your very eyes and in your time, the sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the bride.
24Jr 16:10 "When you tell these people all these things, they will say to you: Why has the LORD declared all this great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
24Jr 16:11 Then you will answer them: Because your fathers abandoned Me"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and followed other gods, served them, and worshiped them. Indeed, they abandoned Me and did not keep My law.
24Jr 16:12 You did more evil than your fathers. Look, each one of you was following the stubbornness of his evil heart, not obeying Me.
24Jr 16:13 So I will hurl you from this land into a land that you and your fathers are not familiar with. There you will worship other gods both day and night, for I will not grant you grace.
24Jr 16:14 "However, take note! The days are coming"-- the LORD's declaration-- "when it will no longer be said: As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,
24Jr 16:15 but rather: As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the other lands where He had banished them. For I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors.
24Jr 16:16 "I am about to send for many fishermen"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and they will fish for them. Then I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and out of the clefts of the rocks,
24Jr 16:17 for My gaze takes in all their ways. They are not concealed from Me, and their guilt is not hidden from My sight.
24Jr 16:18 I will first repay them double for their guilt and sin because they have polluted My land. They have filled My inheritance with the lifelessness of their detestable and abhorrent idols."
24Jr 16:19 LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in a time of distress, the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth, and they will say, "Our fathers inherited only lies, worthless idols of no benefit at all."
24Jr 16:20 Can one make gods for himself? But they are not gods.
24Jr 16:21 "Therefore, I am about to inform them, and this time I will make them know My power and My might; then they will know that My name is Yahweh."
24Jr 17:1 The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars,
24Jr 17:2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles, by the green trees on the high hills--
24Jr 17:3 My mountains in the countryside. Your wealth and all your treasures I will give up as plunder because of the sin of your high places within all your borders.
24Jr 17:4 You will, of yourself, relinquish your inheritance that I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have set My anger on fire; it will burn forever.
24Jr 17:5 This is what the LORD says: Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind, who makes [human] flesh his strength and turns his heart from the LORD.
24Jr 17:6 He will be like a juniper in the Arabah; he cannot see when good comes but dwells in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land where no one lives.
24Jr 17:7 Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence indeed is the LORD.
24Jr 17:8 He will be like a tree planted by water: it sends its roots out toward a stream, it doesn't fear when heat comes, and its foliage remains green. It will not worry in a year of drought or cease producing fruit.
24Jr 17:9 The heart is more deceitful than anything else and desperately sick-- who can understand it?
24Jr 17:10 I, the LORD, examine the mind, I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve.
24Jr 17:11 He who makes a fortune unjustly is [like] a partridge that hatches eggs it didn't lay. In the middle of his days [his riches] will abandon him, so in the end he will be a fool.
24Jr 17:12 A throne of glory on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary,
24Jr 17:13 LORD, the hope of Israel, all who abandon You will be put to shame. All who turn away from Me will be written in the dirt, for they have abandoned the fountain of living water, the LORD.
24Jr 17:14 Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for You are my praise.
24Jr 17:15 Hear how they keep challenging me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come!"
24Jr 17:16 But I have not run away from being Your shepherd, and I have not longed for the fatal day. You know my words were spoken in Your presence.
24Jr 17:17 Don't become a terror to me. You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
24Jr 17:18 Let my persecutors be put to shame, but don't let me be put to shame. Let them be terrified, but don't let me be terrified. Bring on them the day of disaster; shatter them with total destruction.
24Jr 17:19 This is what the LORD said to me, "Go and stand in the People's Gate, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 17:20 Announce to them: Hear the word of the LORD, kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the residents of Jerusalem who enter through these gates.
24Jr 17:21 This is what the LORD says: Watch yourselves; do not pick up a load and bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
24Jr 17:22 You must not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but you must consecrate the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors.
24Jr 17:23 They wouldn't listen or pay attention but became obstinate, not listening or accepting discipline.
24Jr 17:24 "However, if you listen to Me, says the LORD, and do not bring loads through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day and consecrate the Sabbath day and do no work on it,
24Jr 17:25 kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses with their officials, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem. This city will be inhabited forever.
24Jr 17:26 Then [people] will come from the cities of Judah and from the area around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the Judean foothills, from the hill country and from the Negev bringing burnt offerings and sacrifice, grain offerings and frankincense, and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
24Jr 17:27 If you do not listen to Me to consecrate the Sabbath day by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, I will set fire to its gates, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem and not be extinguished."
24Jr 18:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 18:2 "Go down at once to the potter's house; there I will reveal My words to you."
24Jr 18:3 So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, working away at the wheel.
24Jr 18:4 But the jar that he was making from the clay became flawed in the potter's hand, so he made it into another jar, as it seemed right for him to do.
24Jr 18:5 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 18:6 "House of Israel, can I not treat you as this potter [treats his clay]?"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration. "Just like clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel.
24Jr 18:7 At one moment I might announce concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will uproot, tear down, and destroy [it].
24Jr 18:8 However, if that nation I have made an announcement about, turns from its evil, I will not bring the disaster on it I had planned.
24Jr 18:9 At [another] time I announce that I will build and plant a nation or a kingdom.
24Jr 18:10 However, if it does what is evil in My sight by not listening to My voice, I will not bring the good I had said I would do to it.
24Jr 18:11 So now, say to the men of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem: This is what the LORD says: I am about to bring harm to you and make plans against you. Turn now, each from your evil way, and correct your ways and your deeds.
24Jr 18:12 But they will say: It's hopeless. We will continue to follow our plans, and each of us will continue to act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart."
24Jr 18:13 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Ask among the nations, Who has heard [things] like these? Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
24Jr 18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave the highland crags? Or does cold water flowing from a distance ever fail?
24Jr 18:15 Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to false [idols] that make them stumble in their ways-- in the ancient roads-- to walk on [new] paths, not the highway.
24Jr 18:16 They have made their land a horror, a perpetual object of scorn; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and shake his head.
24Jr 18:17 I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind. I will show them [My] back and not [My] face on the day of their calamity.
24Jr 18:18 Then certain ones said, "Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost from the priest, or counsel from the wise, or an oracle from the prophet. Come, let's denounce him and pay no attention to all his words."
24Jr 18:19 Pay attention to me, LORD. Hear what my opponents are saying!
24Jr 18:20 Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your anger from them.
24Jr 18:21 Therefore, hand their children over to famine, and pour the sword's power on them. Let their wives become childless and widowed, their husbands slain by deadly disease, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
24Jr 18:22 Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring raiders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.
24Jr 18:23 But You, LORD, know all their deadly plots against me. Do not wipe out their guilt; do not blot out their sin before You. Let them be forced to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
24Jr 19:1 This is what the LORD says: "Go, buy a potter's clay jug. Take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests
24Jr 19:2 and go out to the Valley of Hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words I speak to you.
24Jr 19:3 Say: Hear the word of the LORD, kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that everyone who hears about it will shudder
24Jr 19:4 because they have abandoned Me and made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in it to other gods that they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah have never known. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
24Jr 19:5 They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, something I have never commanded or mentioned; I never entertained the thought.
24Jr 19:6 "Therefore, take note! The days are coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24Jr 19:7 I will spoil the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those who want to take their life. I will provide their corpses as food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
24Jr 19:8 I will make this city desolate, an object of scorn. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and scoff because of all its wounds.
24Jr 19:9 I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and they will eat each other's flesh in the siege and distress that their enemies, those who want to take their life, inflict on them.
24Jr 19:10 "Then you are to shatter the jug in the presence of the people traveling with you,
24Jr 19:11 and you are to proclaim to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: I will shatter these people and this city, like one shatters a potter's jar that can never again be mended. They will bury in Topheth until there is no place left to bury.
24Jr 19:12 I will do so to this place"-- [this is] the declaration of the LORD-- "and to its residents, making this city like Topheth.
24Jr 19:13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become impure like that place Topheth-- all the houses on whose rooftops they have burned incense to the whole heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods."
24Jr 19:14 Jeremiah came back from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, stood in the courtyard of the LORD's temple, and proclaimed to all the people,
24Jr 19:15 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'I am about to bring on this city-- and on all its [dependent] villages-- all the disaster that I spoke against it, for they have become obstinate, not obeying My words.'"
24Jr 20:1 Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
24Jr 20:2 So Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the LORD's temple.
24Jr 20:3 The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD does not call you Pashhur, but Magor-missabib,
24Jr 20:4 for this is what the LORD says, 'I am about to make you a terror to both yourself and those you love. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will deport them to Babylon and put them to the sword.
24Jr 20:5 I will give away all the wealth of this city, all its products and valuables. Indeed, I will hand all the treasures of the kings of Judah over to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon.
24Jr 20:6 As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon. There you will die, and there you will be buried, you and all your friends that you prophesied falsely to.'"
24Jr 20:7 You deceived me, LORD, and I was deceived. You seized me and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the time; everyone ridicules me.
24Jr 20:8 For whenever I speak, I cry out-- I proclaim: Violence and destruction! because the word of the LORD has become for me constant disgrace and derision.
24Jr 20:9 If I say: I won't mention Him or speak any longer in His name, His message becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in, and I cannot prevail.
24Jr 20:10 For I have heard the gossip of the multitudes, "Terror is on every side! Report [him]; let's report him!" Everyone I trusted watches for my fall. "Perhaps he will be deceived so that we might prevail against him and take our vengeance on him."
24Jr 20:11 But the LORD is with me like a violent warrior. Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly shamed, an everlasting humiliation that will never be forgotten.
24Jr 20:12 LORD of Hosts, testing the righteous and seeing the heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You.
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD, for He rescues the life of the needy from the hand of evil people.
24Jr 20:14 Cursed be the day on which I was born. The day my mother bore me-- let it never be blessed.
24Jr 20:15 Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, "A male child is born to you," bringing him great joy.
24Jr 20:16 Let that man be like the cities the LORD overthrew without compassion. Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a war cry at noontime
24Jr 20:17 because he didn't kill me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave, her womb eternally pregnant.
24Jr 20:18 Why did I come out of the womb to see [only] struggle and sorrow, to end my life in shame?
24Jr 21:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah, asking,
24Jr 21:2 "Ask the LORD on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzarking of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His [past] wonderful works so that [Nebuchadnezzar] will withdraw from us."
24Jr 21:3 But Jeremiah answered, "This is what you are to say to Zedekiah:
24Jr 21:4 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will repel the weapons of war in your hands, those you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall, and I will bring them into the center of this city.
24Jr 21:5 I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, rage, and great wrath.
24Jr 21:6 I will strike the residents of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a great plague.
24Jr 21:7 Afterwards'"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "'King Zedekiah of Judah, his officers, and the people-- those in this city who survive the plague, the sword, and the famine-- I will hand over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, to their enemies, yes, to those who want to take their lives. He will put them to the sword; he won't spare them or show pity or compassion.'
24Jr 21:8 "But you must say to this people, 'This is what the LORD says: Look, I am presenting to you the way of life and the way of death.
24Jr 21:9 Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live and will retain his life like the spoils [of war].
24Jr 21:10 For I have turned against this city to [bring] disaster and not good""-- [this is] the LORD's declaration. "'It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, who will burn it down.'
24Jr 21:11 "And to the house of the king of Judah [say this]: 'Hear the word of the LORD!
24Jr 21:12 House of David, this is what the LORD says: Administer justice every morning, and rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor, or My anger will flare up like fire and burn unquenchably because of their evil deeds.
24Jr 21:13 Beware! I am against you, you who sit above the valley, [you atop] the rocky plateau-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- you who say: Who can come down against us? Who can enter our hiding places?
24Jr 21:14 I will punish you according to what you have done-- [this is] the LORD's declaration. I will kindle a fire in its forest that will consume everything around it.'"
24Jr 22:1 This is what the LORD says: "Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and announce this word there.
24Jr 22:2 You are to say: Hear the word of the LORD, king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David-- you, your officers, and your people who enter these gates.
24Jr 22:3 This is what the LORD says: Administer justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor. Don't exploit or brutalize the alien, the fatherless, or the widow. Don't shed innocent blood in this place.
24Jr 22:4 For if you conscientiously carry out this word, then kings sitting on David's throne will enter through the gates of this palace riding on chariots and horses-- they, their officers, and their people.
24Jr 22:5 But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by Myself"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "that this house will become a ruin."
24Jr 22:6 For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are like Gilead to Me, [or] the summit of Lebanon, but I will certainly turn you into a wilderness, uninhabited cities.
24Jr 22:7 I will appoint destroyers against you, each with his weapons. They will cut down the choicest of your cedars and throw them into the fire.
24Jr 22:8 "Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another: Why did the LORD do such a thing to this great city?
24Jr 22:9 They will answer: Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped and served other gods."
24Jr 22:10 Do not weep for the dead; do not mourn for him. Weep bitterly for the one who has gone away, for he will never return again and see his native land.
24Jr 22:11 For this is what the LORD says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded Josiah his father as king: "He has left this place-- he will never return here again,
24Jr 22:12 but he will die in the place where they deported him, never seeing this land again."
24Jr 22:13 Woe for the one who builds his palace through unrighteousness, his upper rooms through injustice, who makes his fellow man serve without pay and will not give him his wages,
24Jr 22:14 who says: I will build myself a massive palace, with spacious upper rooms. He will cut windows in it, and it will be paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion.
24Jr 22:15 Are you a king because you excel in cedar? Your own father, did he not eat and drink? He administered justice and righteousness, then it went well with him.
24Jr 22:16 He took up the case of the poor and needy, then it went well. Is this not what it means to know Me? [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 22:17 But you have eyes and heart for nothing except your own unjust gain, shedding innocent blood and committing extortion and oppression.
24Jr 22:18 Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not mourn for him, [saying,] Woe, my brother! or Woe, [my] sister! They will not mourn for him, saying, Woe, lord! Woe, his majesty!
24Jr 22:19 He will be buried [like] a donkey, dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 22:20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out; raise your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers have been crushed.
24Jr 22:21 I spoke to you when you were secure. You said: I will not listen. This has been your way since youth; indeed, you have never listened to Me.
24Jr 22:22 The wind will take charge of all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity. Then you will be ashamed and humiliated because of all your evil.
24Jr 22:23 You residents of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when labor pains come on you, agony like a woman in labor.
24Jr 22:24 "As I live," says the LORD, "though you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet ring on My right hand, I would tear you from it.
24Jr 22:25 In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who want to take your life, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
24Jr 22:26 I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another land, where neither of you were born, and there you will both die.
24Jr 22:27 They will never return to the land they long to return to."
24Jr 22:28 Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, a jar no one wants? Why are he and his descendants hurled out and cast into a land they have not known?
24Jr 22:29 Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD!
24Jr 22:30 This is what the LORD says: Record this man as childless, a man who will not be successful in his lifetime. None of his descendants will succeed in sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah.
24Jr 23:1 "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!" [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:2 "Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who shepherd My people: You have scattered My flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I will attend to you because of your evil acts"-- the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:3 "I will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous.
24Jr 23:4 I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, nor will any be missing." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:5 "The days are coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when I will raise up a righteous Branch of David. He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 23:6 In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is what He will be named: The LORD Is Our Righteousness.
24Jr 23:7 The days are coming"-- the LORD's declaration-- "when it will no longer be said: As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,
24Jr 23:8 but: As the LORD lives, who brought and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other countries where I had banished them. They will dwell once more in their own land."
24Jr 23:9 Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD, because of His holy words.
24Jr 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; the land mourns because of the curse, and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up. Their way of life has become evil, and their power is not rightly used
24Jr 23:11 because both prophet and priest are ungodly, even in My house I have found their evil. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:12 Therefore, their way will be to them like slippery paths in the gloom. They will be driven away and fall down there, for I will bring disaster on them, the year of their punishment. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:13 Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something disgusting: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
24Jr 23:14 Among the prophets of Jerusalem also I saw a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, and none turns his back on evil. They are all like Sodom to Me; Jerusalem's residents are like Gomorrah.
24Jr 23:15 Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says concerning the prophets: I am about to feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.
24Jr 23:16 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are making you worthless. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the LORD's mouth.
24Jr 23:17 They keep on saying to those who despise Me: The LORD has said: You will have peace. To everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his heart they have said, No harm will come to you."
24Jr 23:18 For who has stood in the council of the LORD to see and hear His word? Who has paid attention to His word and obeyed?
24Jr 23:19 Look, a storm from the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling storm. It will whirl about the head of the wicked.
24Jr 23:20 The LORD's anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it clearly.
24Jr 23:21 I did not send these prophets, yet they ran [with a message]. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
24Jr 23:22 If they had really stood in My council, they would have enabled My people to hear My words and would have turned them back from their evil ways and their evil deeds.
24Jr 23:23 "Am I a God who is only near"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "and not a God who is far away?
24Jr 23:24 Can a man hide himself in secret places where I cannot see him?"-- the LORD's declaration. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?"-- the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:25 "I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in My name have said: I had a dream! I had a dream!
24Jr 23:26 How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds?
24Jr 23:27 Through their dreams that they tell one another, they make plans to cause My people to forget My name as their fathers forgot My name through Baal worship.
24Jr 23:28 The prophet who has [only] a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has My word should speak My word truthfully, for what is straw [compared] to grain?"-- the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:29 "Is not My word like fire"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and like a sledgehammer that pulverizes rock?
24Jr 23:30 Therefore, take note! I am against the prophets"-- the LORD's declaration-- "who steal My words from each other.
24Jr 23:31 I am against the prophets"-- the LORD's declaration-- "who use their own tongues to deliver an oracle.
24Jr 23:32 I am against those who prophesy false dreams"-- the LORD's declaration-- "telling them and leading My people astray with their falsehoods and their boasting. It was not I who sent or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:33 "Now when these people or a prophet or a priest asks you: What is the burden of the LORD? you will respond to them: What is the burden? I will throw you away"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 23:34 "As for the prophet, priest, or people who say: The burden of the LORD, I will punish that man and his household.
24Jr 23:35 This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother: What has the LORD answered? or What has the LORD spoken?
24Jr 23:36 But no longer refer to the burden of the LORD, for each man's word becomes his burden and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God.
24Jr 23:37 You must say to the prophet: What has the LORD answered you? and What has the LORD spoken?
24Jr 23:38 But if you say: The burden of the LORD, then this is what the LORD says: Because you have said, The burden of the LORD, and I specifically told you not to say, The burden of the LORD,
24Jr 23:39 I will surely forget you and throw away from My presence both you and the city that I gave you and your fathers.
24Jr 23:40 I will bring on you everlasting shame and humiliation that will never be forgotten."
24Jr 24:1 After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 24:2 One basket [contained] very good figs, like early figs, but the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they were inedible.
24Jr 24:3 The LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" I said, "Figs! The good figs are very good, but the bad figs are extremely bad, so bad they are inedible."
24Jr 24:4 The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 24:5 "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Like these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles from Judah I sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 24:6 I will keep My eyes on them for their good and will return them to this land. I will build them up and not demolish them; I will plant them and not uproot them.
24Jr 24:7 I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD. They will be My people, and I will be their God because they will return to Me with all their heart.
24Jr 24:8 "But as for the bad figs, so bad they are inedible, this is what the LORD says: in this way I will deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem-- those remaining in this land and those living in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 24:9 I will make them an object of horror and disaster to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace, an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing, wherever I have banished them.
24Jr 24:10 I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they have perished from the land I gave to them and their ancestors."
24Jr 25:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon).
24Jr 25:2 The prophet Jeremiah spoke concerning all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
24Jr 25:3 "From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until this very day-- 23 years-- the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed.
24Jr 25:4 The LORD sent all His servants the prophets to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed or even paid attention.
24Jr 25:5 He announced, 'Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever.
24Jr 25:6 Do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.
24Jr 25:7 " 'But you would not obey Me'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'in order that you might provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands and bring disaster on yourselves.'
24Jr 25:8 "Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: 'Because you have not obeyed My words,
24Jr 25:9 I am going to send for all the families of the north'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'and [send for] My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will bring them against this land, against its residents, and against all these surrounding nations, and I will completely destroy them and make them a desolation, a derision, and ruins forever.
24Jr 25:10 I will eliminate the sound of joy and gladness from them-- the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
24Jr 25:11 This whole land will become a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.
24Jr 25:12 When the 70 years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, and I will make it a ruin forever.
24Jr 25:13 I will bring on that land all My words I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
24Jr 25:14 For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.'"
24Jr 25:15 This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: "Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and make all the nations I am sending you to drink from it.
24Jr 25:16 They will drink, stagger, and go out of their minds because of the sword I am sending among them."
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup from the LORD's hand and made all the nations drink [from it], everyone the LORD sent me to.
24Jr 25:18 [These included:] Jerusalem and the [other] cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an object of scorn and cursing-- as it is today;
24Jr 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officers, his leaders, all his people,
24Jr 25:20 and all the mixed peoples; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines-- Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
24Jr 25:21 Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
24Jr 25:22 all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
24Jr 25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all those who shave their temples;
24Jr 25:24 all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed peoples who have settled in the desert;
24Jr 25:25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
24Jr 25:26 all the kings of the north, both near and far from one another; that is, all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. Finally, the king of Sheshach will drink after them.
24Jr 25:27 "Then you are to say to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, as a result of the sword I am sending among you.
24Jr 25:28 If they refuse to take the cup from you and drink, you are to say to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: You must drink!
24Jr 25:29 For I am already bringing disaster on the city that bears My name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth"-- [this is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
24Jr 25:30 "As for you, you are to prophesy all these things to them, and say to them: The LORD roars from on high; He raises His voice from His holy dwelling. He roars loudly over His grazing land; He calls out with a shout, like those who tread [grapes], against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24Jr 25:31 The tumult reaches to the ends of the earth because the LORD brings a case against the nations. He enters into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, He hands them over to the sword-- [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 25:32 "This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Pay attention! Disaster goes forth from nation to nation. A great storm is stirred up from the ends of the earth."
24Jr 25:33 Those slain by the LORD on that day will be [spread] from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like manure on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 25:34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. Roll [in the dust],you leaders of the flock. Because the days of your slaughter have come, you will fall and become shattered like a precious vase.
24Jr 25:35 Flight will be impossible for the shepherds, and escape, for the leaders of the flock.
24Jr 25:36 [Hear] the sound of the shepherds' cry, the wail of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture.
24Jr 25:37 Peaceful grazing land will become lifeless because of the LORD's burning anger.
24Jr 25:38 He has left His den like a lion, for their land has become a desolation because of the sword of the oppressor, because of His burning anger.
24Jr 26:1 At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
24Jr 26:2 "This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD's temple and speak all the words I have commanded you to speak to all Judah's cities that are coming to worship there. Do not hold back a word.
24Jr 26:3 Perhaps they will listen and return-- each from his evil way of life-- so that I might relent concerning the disaster that I plan to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.
24Jr 26:4 You are to say to them: This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to Me by living according to My law that I set before you
24Jr 26:5 and by listening to the words of My servants the prophets I have been sending you time and time again, though you did not listen,
24Jr 26:6 I will make this temple like Shiloh. I will make this city an object of cursing for all the nations of the earth."
24Jr 26:7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 26:8 He finished the address the LORD had commanded him to deliver to all the people. Then the priests, the prophets, and all the people took hold of him, yelling, "You must surely die!
24Jr 26:9 How dare you prophesy in the name of the LORD, 'This temple will become like Shiloh and this city will become an uninhabited ruin'!" Then all the people assembled against Jeremiah at the LORD's temple.
24Jr 26:10 When the officials of Judah heard these things, they went up from the king's palace to the LORD's temple and sat at the entrance of the New Gate.
24Jr 26:11 Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, "This man deserves the death sentence because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears."
24Jr 26:12 Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and the people, "The LORD sent me to prophesy all the words that you have heard against this temple and city.
24Jr 26:13 So now, correct your ways and deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God so that He might relent concerning the disaster that He warned about.
24Jr 26:14 As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right.
24Jr 26:15 But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its residents, for it is certain the LORD has sent me to speak all these things directly to you."
24Jr 26:16 Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, "This man doesn't deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God!"
24Jr 26:17 Some of the elders of the land stood up and said to all the assembled people,
24Jr 26:18 "Micah the Moreshite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and said to all the people of Judah, 'This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the temple mount a forested hill.'
24Jr 26:19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all [the people of] Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and plead for the LORD's favor, and did not the LORD relent concerning the disaster He had pronounced against them? We are about to bring great harm on ourselves!"
24Jr 26:20 Another man was also prophesying in the name of the LORD-- Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like all those of Jeremiah.
24Jr 26:21 King Jehoiakim, all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, and the king tried to put him to death. When Uriah heard, he fled in fear and went to Egypt.
24Jr 26:22 But King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Achbor and [certain other] men with him [went] to Egypt.
24Jr 26:23 They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who executed him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people.
24Jr 26:24 But Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
24Jr 27:1 At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 27:2 "This is what the LORD said to me: Make fetters and yoke bars for yourself and put them on your neck.
24Jr 27:3 Send [word] to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon through messengers who are coming to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem.
24Jr 27:4 Command them [to go] to their masters, saying: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: This is what you must say to your masters:
24Jr 27:5 By My great strength and outstretched arm, I made the earth, and the people, and animals on the face of the earth. I give it to anyone I please.
24Jr 27:6 So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. I have even given him the wild animals to serve him.
24Jr 27:7 All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
24Jr 27:8 "As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish by sword, famine, and plague"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "until through him I have destroyed it.
24Jr 27:9 But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers who say to you: Don't serve the king of Babylon!
24Jr 27:10 for they prophesy a lie to you so that you will be removed from your land. I will banish you, and you will perish.
24Jr 27:11 But as for the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave it in its own land, and that nation will till it and reside in it." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 27:12 I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way: "Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live!
24Jr 27:13 Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, or plague as the LORD has threatened against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?
24Jr 27:14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you, 'You must not serve the king of Babylon,' for they are prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:15 'I have not sent them'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'and they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore, I will banish you, and you will perish-- you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.'"
24Jr 27:16 Then I spoke to the priests and all these people, saying, "This is what the LORD says, 'Do not listen to the words of your prophets. They are prophesying to you, claiming: Look, very soon now the articles of the LORD's temple will be brought back from Babylon. They are prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
24Jr 27:18 If they are indeed prophets and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them intercede with the LORD of Hosts not to let the articles that remain in the LORD's temple, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem go to Babylon.'
24Jr 27:19 For this is what the LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the water carts, and the rest of the articles that still remain in this city,
24Jr 27:20 those Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
24Jr 27:21 Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the temple of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
24Jr 27:22 'They will be brought to Babylon and will remain there until I attend to them again.' [This is] the LORD's declaration. 'Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.'"
24Jr 28:1 In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon said to me in the temple of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people,
24Jr 28:2 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 28:3 Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the LORD's temple that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from here and transported to Babylon.
24Jr 28:4 And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'"
24Jr 28:5 The prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 28:6 The prophet Jeremiah said, " Amen! May the LORD do so. May the LORD make the words you have prophesied come true and may He restore the articles of the LORD's temple and all the exiles from Babylon to this place!
24Jr 28:7 Only listen to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
24Jr 28:8 The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms.
24Jr 28:9 As for the prophet who prophesies peace-- only when the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one whom the LORD has truly sent."
24Jr 28:10 The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
24Jr 28:11 In the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, "This is what the LORD says: 'In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from the neck of all the nations.' " Jeremiah the prophet then went on his way.
24Jr 28:12 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet:
24Jr 28:13 "Go say to Hananiah: This is what the LORD says: You broke a wooden yoke bar, but in its place you will make an iron yoke bar.
24Jr 28:14 For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all these nations that they might serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have also put the wild animals under him."
24Jr 28:15 The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, but you have led these people to trust in a lie.
24Jr 28:16 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'I am about to send you off the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have spoken rebellion against the LORD.'"
24Jr 28:17 And the prophet Hananiah died that year in the seventh month.
24Jr 29:1 This is the text of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exiles, the priests, the prophets, and all the people Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24Jr 29:2 [This was] after King Jeconiah,the queen mother, the court officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalsmiths had left Jerusalem.
24Jr 29:3 [The letter was sent] by Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. [The letter] stated:
24Jr 29:4 This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon:
24Jr 29:5 "Build houses and live [in them]. Plant gardens and eat their produce.
24Jr 29:6 Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men [in marriage] so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease.
24Jr 29:7 Seek the welfare of the city I have deported you to. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for when it has prosperity, you will prosper."
24Jr 29:8 For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "Don't let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you, and don't listen to the dreams you elicit from them,
24Jr 29:9 for they are prophesying falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 29:10 For this is what the LORD says: "When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place.
24Jr 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "plans for [your] welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.
24Jr 29:12 You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
24Jr 29:13 You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
24Jr 29:14 I will be found by you"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and I will restore your fortunesand gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you"-- the LORD's declaration. "I will restore you to the place I deported you from."
24Jr 29:15 You have said, "The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon!"
24Jr 29:16 But this is what the LORD says concerning the king sitting on David's throne and concerning all the people living in this city-- that is, concerning your brothers who did not go with you into exile.
24Jr 29:17 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: "I am about to send against them sword, famine, and plague and will make them like rotten figs that are inedible because they are so bad.
24Jr 29:18 I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth-- a curse and a desolation, an object of scorn and a disgrace among all the nations where I will have banished them.
24Jr 29:19 [I will do this] because they have not listened to My words"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "that I sent to them with My servants the prophets time and time again.And you too have not listened." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 29:20 Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24Jr 29:21 This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to Ahab son of Kolaiah and to Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, the ones prophesying a lie to you in My name: "I am about to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your very eyes.
24Jr 29:22 Based on [what happens to] them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will create a curse that says: May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!
24Jr 29:23 because they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing adultery with their neighbors' wives and have spoken a lie in My name, which I did not command them. I am He who knows, and I am a witness." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 29:24 To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you are to say,
24Jr 29:25 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You in your own name have sent out letters to all the people of Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying:
24Jr 29:26 The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest to be the chief officer in the temple of the LORD, responsible for every madman who acts like a prophet. You must confine him in stocks and an iron collar.
24Jr 29:27 So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who has been acting like a prophet among you?
24Jr 29:28 For he has sent [word] to us in Babylon, claiming: The exile will be long. Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce."
24Jr 29:29 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
24Jr 29:30 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 29:31 "Send [a message] to all the exiles, saying: This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite. Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and made you trust a lie,
24Jr 29:32 this is what the LORD says: I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. There will not be even one of his [descendants] living among these people, nor will any ever see the good that I will bring to My people"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "for he has preached rebellion against the LORD."
24Jr 30:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
24Jr 30:2 This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: "Write down on a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you,
24Jr 30:3 for the days are certainly coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah"-- the LORD's declaration. "I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors and they will possess it."
24Jr 30:4 These are the words the LORD spoke to Israel and Judah.
24Jr 30:5 Yes, this is what the LORD says: We have heard a cry of terror, of dread-- there is no peace.
24Jr 30:6 Ask and see whether a male can give birth. Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor and every face turned pale?
24Jr 30:7 How awful that day will be! There will be none like it! It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be delivered out of it.
24Jr 30:8 "On that day"-- [this is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "I will break his yoke from your neck and snap your fetters so strangers will never again enslave him.
24Jr 30:9 They will serve the LORD their God and I will raise up David their king for them."
24Jr 30:10 As for you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- and do not be dismayed, Israel, for I will without fail save you from far away, your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him.
24Jr 30:11 For I will be with you-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- to save you! I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have scattered you; however, I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you justly, but I will by no means leave you unpunished.
24Jr 30:12 For this is what the LORD says: Your injury is incurable; your wound most severe.
24Jr 30:13 No one takes up the case for your sores. You have nothing that can heal you.
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer look for you, for I have struck you like an enemy would, with the discipline of someone cruel, because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins.
24Jr 30:15 Why do you cry out about your injury? Your pain has no cure! I have done these things to you because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins.
24Jr 30:16 Nevertheless, all who devoured you will be devoured, and all your adversaries-- all of them-- will go off into exile. Your despoilers will become spoil, and all who plunder you will be plundered.
24Jr 30:17 But I will bring you health and will heal you of your wounds-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- for they call you The Outcast, that Zion no one cares about.
24Jr 30:18 This is what the LORD says: I will certainly restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and show compassion on his dwellings. Every city will be rebuilt on its mound; every citadel will stand on its proper site.
24Jr 30:19 Thanksgiving will come out of them, a sound of celebration. I will multiply them, and they will not decrease; I will honor them, and they will not be insignificant.
24Jr 30:20 His children will be as in past days; his congregation will be established in My presence. I will punish all his oppressors.
24Jr 30:21 Jacob's leader will be one of them; his ruler will issue from him. I will invite him to Me, and he will approach Me, for who would otherwise risk his life to approach Me? [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 30:22 You will be My people, and I will be your God.
24Jr 30:23 Look, a storm from the LORD! Wrath has gone forth. A churning storm, it will whirl about the head of the wicked.
24Jr 30:24 The LORD's burning anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it.
24Jr 31:1 "At that time"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "I will be God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people."
24Jr 31:2 This is what the LORD says: They found favor in the wilderness-- the people who survived the sword. [When] Israel went to find rest,
24Jr 31:3 the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.
24Jr 31:4 Again I will build you so that you will be rebuilt, Virgin Israel. You will take up your tambourines again and go forth in joyful dancing.
24Jr 31:5 You will plant vineyards again on the mountains of Samaria; the planters will plant and will enjoy [the fruit].
24Jr 31:6 For there will be a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim: Get up, let's go up to Zion, to the LORD our God!
24Jr 31:7 For this is what the LORD says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the chief of the nations! Proclaim, praise, and say: LORD, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!
24Jr 31:8 Watch! I am going to bring them from the northern land. I will gather them from remote regions of the earth-- the blind and the lame will be with them, along with those who are pregnant and those about to give birth. They will return here as a great assembly!
24Jr 31:9 They will come weeping, but I will bring them back with consolation. I will lead them to wadis [filled] with water by a smooth way where they will not stumble, for I am Israel's Father, and Ephraim is My firstborn.
24Jr 31:10 Nations, hear the word of the LORD, and tell it among the far off coastlands! Say: The One who scattered Israel will gather him. He will watch over him as a shepherd [guards] his flock,
24Jr 31:11 for the LORD has ransomed Jacob and redeemed him from the power of one stronger than he.
24Jr 31:12 They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy because of the LORD's goodness, because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and because of the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like an irrigated garden, and they will no longer grow weak [from hunger].
24Jr 31:13 Then the virgin will rejoice with dancing, while young and old men [rejoice] together. I will turn their mourning into joy, give them consolation, and [bring] happiness out of grief.
24Jr 31:14 I will give the priests their fill with abundance, and My people will be satisfied with My goodness. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 31:15 This is what the LORD says: A voice was heard in Ramah, a lament with bitter weeping-- Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children because they are no more.
24Jr 31:16 This is what the LORD says: Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for the reward for your work will come-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- and your children will return from the enemy's land.
24Jr 31:17 There is hope for your future-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- and your children will return to their own territory.
24Jr 31:18 I have heard Ephraim moaning: You disciplined me, and I have been disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and I will return, for you, LORD, are my God.
24Jr 31:19 After I returned, I repented; After I was instructed, I struck my thigh [in grief]. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.
24Jr 31:20 Isn't Ephraim a precious son to Me, a delightful child? Whenever I speak against him, I certainly still think about him. Therefore, My inner being yearns for him; I will truly have compassion on him. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 31:21 Set up road markers for yourself; establish signposts! Keep the highway in mind, the way you have traveled. Return, Virgin Israel! Return to these cities of yours.
24Jr 31:22 How long will you turn here and there, faithless daughter? For the LORD creates something new in the land-- a female will shelter a man.
24Jr 31:23 This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "When I restore their fortunes, they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities: May the LORD bless you, righteous settlement, holy mountain.
24Jr 31:24 Judah and all its cities will live in it together-- also farmers and those who move with the flocks--
24Jr 31:25 for I satisfy the thirsty person and feed all those who are weak."
24Jr 31:26 At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
24Jr 31:27 "The days are coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
24Jr 31:28 Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear them down, to demolish and to destroy, and to cause disaster, so will I be attentive to build and to plant them," says the LORD.
24Jr 31:29 "In those days, it will never again be said: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
24Jr 31:30 Rather, each will die for his own wrongdoing. Anyone who eats sour grapes-- his own teeth will be set on edge.
24Jr 31:31 "Look, the days are coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
24Jr 31:32 [This one will] not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt-- a covenant they broke even though I had married them"-- the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 31:33 "Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days"-- the LORD's declaration. "I will place My law within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people.
24Jr 31:34 No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying: Know the LORD, for they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them"-- the LORD's declaration. "For I will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin."
24Jr 31:35 This is what the LORD says: The One who gives the sun for light by day, the fixed order of moon and stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and makes its waves roar-- the LORD of Hosts is His name:
24Jr 31:36 If this fixed order departs from My presence-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- then also Israel's descendants will cease to be a nation before Me forever.
24Jr 31:37 This is what the LORD says: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below explored, I will reject all of Israel's descendants because of all they have done-- [this is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 31:38 "Look, the days are coming"-- the LORD's declaration-- "when the city from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate will be rebuilt for the LORD.
24Jr 31:39 A measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.
24Jr 31:40 The whole valley-- the corpses, the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east-- will be holy to the LORD. It will never be uprooted or demolished again."
24Jr 32:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 32:2 At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the guard's courtyard in the palace of the king of Judah.
24Jr 32:3 Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: "Why are you prophesying, 'This is what the LORD says: Look, I am about to hand this city over to Babylon's king, and he will capture it.
24Jr 32:4 Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; indeed, he will certainly be handed over to Babylon's king. They will speak face to face and meet eye to eye.
24Jr 32:5 He will take Zedekiah to Babylon where he will stay until I attend to him'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration. 'You will fight the Chaldeans, but you will not succeed'?"
24Jr 32:6 Jeremiah replied, "The word of the LORD came to me:
24Jr 32:7 'Watch! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say: Buy my field in Anathoth for yourself, for you own the right of redemption to buy it.'
24Jr 32:8 "Then my cousin Hanamel [came] to the guard's courtyard as the LORD had said and urged me, 'Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
24Jr 32:9 So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out to him the money-- 17 shekels of silver.
24Jr 32:10 I recorded it on a scroll, sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on a scale.
24Jr 32:11 I took the purchase agreement-- the sealed copy with its terms and conditions and the open copy--
24Jr 32:12 and gave the purchase agreement to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah. [I did this] in the sight of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement, and all the Judeans sitting in the guard's courtyard.
24Jr 32:13 "I instructed Baruch in their sight,
24Jr 32:14 'This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these scrolls-- this purchase agreement with the sealed copy and this open copy-- and put them in an earthen storage jar so they will last a long time.
24Jr 32:15 For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.'
24Jr 32:16 "After I had given the purchase agreement to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:
24Jr 32:17 Ah, Lord God! You Yourself made the heavens and earth by Your great power and with Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You!
24Jr 32:18 You show faithful love to thousands but lay the fathers' sins on their sons' laps after them, great and mighty God whose name is the LORD of Hosts,
24Jr 32:19 the One great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men in order to give to each person according to his ways and the result of his deeds.
24Jr 32:20 You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and do so to this very day both in Israel and among mankind. You made a name for Yourself, as [is the case] today.
24Jr 32:21 You brought Your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
24Jr 32:22 You gave them this land You swore [to give] to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.
24Jr 32:23 They entered and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice or live according to Your law. They failed to perform all You commanded them to do, and so You have brought all this disaster on them.
24Jr 32:24 Look! Siege ramps have come against the city to capture it, and the city, as a result of the sword, famine, and plague, has been handed over to the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened. Look, You can see it!
24Jr 32:25 Yet You, Lord God, have said to me: Buy the field with silver and call in witnesses-- even though the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans!"
24Jr 32:26 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 32:27 "Look, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?
24Jr 32:28 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans, to Babylon's king Nebuchadnezzar, and he will capture it.
24Jr 32:29 The Chaldeans who are going to fight against this city will come, set this city on fire, and burn it along with the houses where incense has been burned to Baal on their rooftops and where drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
24Jr 32:30 From their youth, the Israelites and Judeans have done nothing but what is evil in My sight! They have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration--
24Jr 32:31 "for this city has been up against My wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. I will therefore remove it from My presence,
24Jr 32:32 because of all the evil the Israelites and Judeans have done to provoke Me to anger-- they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 32:33 They have turned their backs to Me and not their faces. Though I taught them time and time again, they do not listen and receive discipline.
24Jr 32:34 They have placed their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and have defiled it.
24Jr 32:35 They have built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons and daughters pass through [the fire] to Molech-- something I had not commanded them. I had never entertained the thought that they do this detestable act causing Judah to sin!
24Jr 32:36 "Now therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to this city about which you said: It has been handed over to Babylon's king through sword, famine, and plague:
24Jr 32:37 I am about to gather them from all the lands where I have banished them in My wrath, rage, and great fury, and I will return them to this place and make them live in safety.
24Jr 32:38 They will be My people, and I will be their God.
24Jr 32:39 I will give them one heart and one way so that for their good and for [the good of] their descendants after them, they will fear Me always.
24Jr 32:40 "I will make with them an everlasting covenant: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put fear of Me in their hearts so they will never again turn away from Me.
24Jr 32:41 I will rejoice over them to do what is good to them, and I will plant them faithfully in this land with all My mind and heart.
24Jr 32:42 "For this is what the LORD says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on these people, so am I about to bring on them all the good I am promising them.
24Jr 32:43 Fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying: It's a desolation without man or beast; it has been handed over to the Chaldeans!
24Jr 32:44 Fields will be purchased with silver, the transaction written on a scroll and sealed, and witnesses will be called on in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in Judah's cities-- the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, and the cities of the Negev-- because I will restore their fortunes." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 33:1 While he was still confined in the guard's courtyard, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time:
24Jr 33:2 "The LORD who made the earth, the LORD who forms it to establish it, the LORD is His name, says this:
24Jr 33:3 Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and wondrous things you do not know.
24Jr 33:4 For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of Judah's kings, the ones torn down [for defense] against the siege ramps and the sword:
24Jr 33:5 The people coming to fight the Chaldeans will fill the houses with the corpses of [their own] men I strike down in My wrath and rage. I have hidden My face from this city because of all their evil.
24Jr 33:6 Yet I will certainly bring health and healing to it and will indeed heal them. I will let them experience the abundance of peace and truth.
24Jr 33:7 I will restore the fortunes of Judah and of Israel and will rebuild them as in former times.
24Jr 33:8 I will purify them from all the wrongs they have committed against Me, and I will forgive all the wrongs they have committed against Me, rebelling against Me.
24Jr 33:9 This city will bear on My behalf a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good I will do for them. They will tremble with awe because of all the good and all the peace I will bring about for them.
24Jr 33:10 "This is what the LORD says: In this place which you say is a ruin, without man or beast-- that is, in Judah's cities and Jerusalem's streets that are a desolation without man, without inhabitant, and without beast-- there will be heard again
24Jr 33:11 a sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, and the voice of those saying, Praise the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good; His faithful love endures forever as they bring thank offerings to the temple of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as in former times, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:12 "This is what the LORD of Hosts says: In this desolate place-- without man or beast-- and in all its cities there will once more be a grazing land where shepherds may rest flocks.
24Jr 33:13 The flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them in the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, the cities of the Negev, the land of Benjamin-- the cities surrounding Jerusalem and Judah's cities, says the LORD.
24Jr 33:14 "Look, the days are coming"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "when I will fulfill the good promises that I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24Jr 33:15 In those days and at that time I will cause a Branch of righteousness to sprout up for David, and He will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 33:16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely, and this is what she will be named: The LORD Is Our Righteousness.
24Jr 33:17 For this is what the LORD says: David will never fail to have a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel.
24Jr 33:18 The Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices."
24Jr 33:19 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:20 "This is what the LORD says: If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night so that day and night cease to come at their regular time,
24Jr 33:21 then also My covenant with My servant David may be broken so that he will not have a son reigning on his throne, and the Levitical priests will not be My ministers.
24Jr 33:22 The hosts of heaven cannot be counted; the sand of the sea cannot be measured. So, too, I will make the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who minister to Me innumerable."
24Jr 33:23 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 33:24 "Have you not noticed what these people have said? They say: The LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen. My people are treated with contempt and no longer regarded as a nation among them.
24Jr 33:25 This is what the LORD says: If I do not [keep] My covenant with the day and with the night and fail to establish the fixed order of heaven and earth,
24Jr 33:26 then I might also reject the seed of Jacob and of My servant David-- not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them."
24Jr 34:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, all his army, all the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities:
24Jr 34:2 "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go, speak to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him: This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.
24Jr 34:3 As for you, you will not escape from his hand but are certain to be captured and handed over to him. You will meet the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak face to face;you will go to Babylon.
24Jr 34:4 "Yet hear the LORD's word, Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;
24Jr 34:5 you will die peacefully. There will be a burning ceremony for you just like the burning ceremonies for your fathers, the former kings who preceded you. Alas, lord! will be the lament for you, for I have spoken [this] word." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 34:6 So Jeremiah the prophet related all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
24Jr 34:7 while the king of Babylon's army was attacking Jerusalem and all of Judah's remaining cities-- against Lachish and Azekah, for only they were left among Judah's fortified cities.
24Jr 34:8 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom to them,
24Jr 34:9 so each man would free his male and female Hebrew slaves and no one enslave his Judean brother.
24Jr 34:10 All the officials and people who entered into covenant to free their male and female slaves-- in order not to enslave them any longer-- obeyed and freed them.
24Jr 34:11 Afterwards, however, they changed their minds and took back their male and female slaves they had freed and forced them to become slaves [again].
24Jr 34:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 34:13 "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, saying:
24Jr 34:14 At the end of seven years, each of you must free his Hebrew brother who sold himself to you. He may serve you six years, but then you must send him out free from you. But your ancestors did not obey Me or pay any attention.
24Jr 34:15 Today you repented and did what pleased Me, each of you proclaiming freedom for his neighbor. You made a covenant before Me at the temple called by My name.
24Jr 34:16 But you have changed your minds and profaned My name. Each has taken back his male and female slaves who had been freed [to go] wherever they wanted, and you have [again] subjugated them to be your slaves.
24Jr 34:17 "Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed Me by proclaiming freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. I hereby proclaim freedom for you"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "to the sword, to plague, and to famine! I will make you a horror to all the earth's kingdoms.
24Jr 34:18 As for those who disobeyed My covenant, not keeping the terms of the covenant they made before Me, I will treat them like the calf they cut in two in order to pass between its pieces.
24Jr 34:19 The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf
24Jr 34:20 will be handed over to their enemies, to those who want to take their life. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
24Jr 34:21 I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies, to those who want to take their life, to the king of Babylon's army that is withdrawing.
24Jr 34:22 I am about to give the command"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make Judah's cities a desolation, without inhabitant."
24Jr 35:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
24Jr 35:2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the temple of the LORD to offer them a drink of wine."
24Jr 35:3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons-- the entire house of the Rechabites--
24Jr 35:4 and I brought them into the temple of the LORD to a chamber [occupied by] the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who had a chamber near the officials' chamber, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
24Jr 35:5 I set jars filled with wine and some cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites and said to them, "Drink wine!"
24Jr 35:6 But they replied, "We do not drink wine, for Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, commanded: 'You and your sons must never drink wine.
24Jr 35:7 You must not build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. [Those things] are not for you. Rather, you must live in tents your whole life, so you may live a long time on the soil where you stay as a resident alien.'
24Jr 35:8 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, in all he commanded us. So we haven't drunk wine our whole life-- we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.
24Jr 35:9 We also have not built houses to live in and do not have vineyard, field, or seed.
24Jr 35:10 But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done as our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
24Jr 35:11 However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land, we said: Come, let's go into Jerusalem to get away from the Chaldean and Aramean armies. So we have been living in Jerusalem."
24Jr 35:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 35:13 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Go, say to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: Will you not accept discipline by listening to My words?"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 35:14 "The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk to this very day because they have obeyed their ancestor's command. But I have spoken to you time and time again, and you have not obeyed Me!
24Jr 35:15 Time and time again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: Turn, each one from his evil way of life, and correct your actions. Stop following other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not pay attention or obey Me.
24Jr 35:16 Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out their ancestor's command he gave them, but these people have not obeyed Me.
24Jr 35:17 Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them, but they would not answer."
24Jr 35:18 Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and have kept all his commands and have done all that he commanded you,
24Jr 35:19 this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to always stand before Me.'"
24Jr 36:1 In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
24Jr 36:2 "Take a scroll, and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations from the time I [first] spoke to you during Josiah's reign until today.
24Jr 36:3 Perhaps, when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their wrongdoing and sin."
24Jr 36:4 So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. At Jeremiah's dictation, Baruch wrote on a scroll all the words the LORD had spoken to Jeremiah.
24Jr 36:5 Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, "I am restricted; I cannot enter the temple of the LORD,
24Jr 36:6 so you must go and read from the scroll-- which you wrote at my dictation-- the words of the LORD in the hearing of the people at the temple of the LORD on a day of fasting. You must also read them in the hearing of all the Judeans who are coming from their cities.
24Jr 36:7 Perhaps their petition will come before the LORD, and each one will turn from his evil way, for the anger and fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people are great."
24Jr 36:8 So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. At the LORD's temple he read the LORD's words from the scroll.
24Jr 36:9 In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people of Jerusalem and all those coming in from Judah's cities into Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
24Jr 36:10 Then at the LORD's temple, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the LORD's temple, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read Jeremiah's words from the scroll.
24Jr 36:11 When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
24Jr 36:12 he went down to the scribe's chamber in the king's palace. All the officials were sitting there-- Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
24Jr 36:13 Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
24Jr 36:14 Then all the officials sent [word] to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, "Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them.
24Jr 36:15 They said to him, "Sit down and read [it] in our hearing." So Baruch read [it] in their hearing.
24Jr 36:16 When they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear and said to Baruch, "We must surely tell the king all these things."
24Jr 36:17 Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us-- how did you write all these words? At his dictation?"
24Jr 36:18 Baruch said to them, "At his dictation. He recited all these words to me while I was writing on the scroll in ink."
24Jr 36:19 The officials said to Baruch, "You and Jeremiah must hide yourselves and tell no one where you are."
24Jr 36:20 Then they came to the king at the courtyard, having deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and reported everything in the hearing of the king.
24Jr 36:21 The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi then read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing by the king.
24Jr 36:22 Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters with a fire burning in front of him.
24Jr 36:23 As soon as Jehudi would read three or four columns, Jehoiakim would cut the scroll with a scribe's knife and throw the columns into the blazing fire until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier.
24Jr 36:24 As they heard all these words, the king and all of his servants did not became terrified or tear their garments.
24Jr 36:25 Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24Jr 36:26 Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD had hidden them.
24Jr 36:27 After the king had burned the scroll with the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
24Jr 36:28 "Take another scroll, and once again write on it the very words that were on the original scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
24Jr 36:29 You are to proclaim concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: This is what the LORD says: You have burned the scroll, saying: Why have you written on it: The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and cause it to be without man or beast?
24Jr 36:30 Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David's throne, and his corpse will be thrown out [to be exposed] to the heat of day and the frost of night.
24Jr 36:31 I will punish him, his descendants, and his officers for their wrongdoing. I will bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the disaster, which I warned them about but they did not listen."
24Jr 36:32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at Jeremiah's dictation all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, Judah's king, had burned in the fire. And many other words like them were added.
24Jr 37:1 Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made him king.
24Jr 37:2 He and his officers and the people of the land did not obey the words of the LORD that He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
24Jr 37:3 Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, requesting, "Please pray to the LORD our God for us!"
24Jr 37:4 Jeremiah was going about his daily tasks among the people, for they had not [yet] put him into the prison.
24Jr 37:5 Pharaoh's army had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
24Jr 37:6 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
24Jr 37:7 "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: This is what you will say to Judah's king, who is sending you to inquire of Me: Watch: Pharaoh's army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of Egypt.
24Jr 37:8 The Chaldeans will then return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it down.
24Jr 37:9 This is what the LORD says: Don't deceive yourselves by saying: The Chaldeans will leave us for good, for they will not leave.
24Jr 37:10 Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting with you, and there remained among them only the badly wounded men, each in his tent, they would get up and burn this city down."
24Jr 37:11 When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
24Jr 37:12 Jeremiah [started to] leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people.
24Jr 37:13 But when he was at the Benjamin Gate, an officer of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, and he apprehended Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chaldeans."
24Jr 37:14 "[That's] a lie," Jeremiah replied. "I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!" Irijah would not listen to him but apprehended Jeremiah and took him to the officials.
24Jr 37:15 The officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison.
24Jr 37:16 So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and stayed there many days.
24Jr 37:17 King Zedekiah later sent [for him] and received him, and in his house privately asked him, "Is there a word from the LORD?" "There is," Jeremiah responded, and he continued, "You will be handed over to the king of Babylon."
24Jr 37:18 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people that you have put me in prison?
24Jr 37:19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and this land'?
24Jr 37:20 So now please listen, my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Don't send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there."
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah gave orders, and Jeremiah was placed in the guard's courtyard. He was given a loaf of bread each day from the baker's street until all the bread was gone from the city. So Jeremiah remained in the guard's courtyard.
24Jr 38:1 Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words Jeremiah was speaking to all the people:
24Jr 38:2 "This is what the LORD says: 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live. He will keep his life like the spoils [of war] and will live.'
24Jr 38:3 This is what the LORD says: 'This city will most certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon's army, and he will capture it.'"
24Jr 38:4 The officials then said to the king, "This man ought to die, because he is weakening the morale of the warriors who remain in this city and of all the people by speaking to them in this way. This man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but disaster."
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah said, "Here he is; he's in your hands since the king can't do anything against you."
24Jr 38:6 So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah the king's son, which was in the guard's courtyard, lowering Jeremiah with ropes. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
24Jr 38:7 But Ebed-melech, a Cushite court official employed in the king's palace, heard Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
24Jr 38:8 Ebed-melech went from the king's palace and spoke to the king:
24Jr 38:9 "My lord king, these men have been evil in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the cistern where he will die from hunger, because there is no more bread in the city."
24Jr 38:10 So the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Cushite, "Take from here 30 men under your authority and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he dies."
24Jr 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went to the king's palace to a place below the storehouse. From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
24Jr 38:12 Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah, "Place these old rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes." Jeremiah did so,
24Jr 38:13 and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, but he continued to stay in the guard's courtyard.
24Jr 38:14 King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the LORD's temple. The king said to Jeremiah, "I am going to ask you something; don't hide anything from me."
24Jr 38:15 Jeremiah replied to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, you will kill me, won't you? Besides, if I give you advice, you won't listen to me anyway."
24Jr 38:16 King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private, "As the LORD lives, who has given us this life, I will not kill you or hand you over to these men who want to take your life."
24Jr 38:17 Jeremiah therefore said to Zedekiah, "This is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'If indeed you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will survive.
24Jr 38:18 But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape from them.'"
24Jr 38:19 But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am worried about the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans. They may hand me over to them to abuse me."
24Jr 38:20 "They will not hand you over," Jeremiah replied. "Obey the voice of the LORD in what I am telling you, so it may go well for you and you can live.
24Jr 38:21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is the verdict that the LORD has shown me:
24Jr 38:22 'All the women who remain in the palace of Judah's king will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon and will say: Your trusted friends misled you and overcame you. Your feet sank into the mire, and they deserted you.
24Jr 38:23 All your wives and sons will be brought out to the Chaldeans. You yourself will not escape from them, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon and this city will burn down.'"
24Jr 38:24 Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, "Don't let anyone know about these things or you will die.
24Jr 38:25 If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come and demand of you, 'Tell us what you said to the king; don't hide anything from us and we won't kill you. Also, what did the king say to you?'
24Jr 38:26 then you will tell them, 'I was bringing before the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
24Jr 38:27 When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he reported the exact words to them the king had commanded, and they quit speaking with him because nothing had been heard.
24Jr 38:28 Jeremiah remained in the guard's courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured, and he was [there] when it happened.
24Jr 39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to it.
24Jr 39:2 In the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into.
24Jr 39:3 All the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of Babylon's king.
24Jr 39:4 When he saw them, Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls. They left along the route to the Arabah.
24Jr 39:5 However, the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, arrested him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's king, at Riblah in the land of Hamath. The king passed sentence on him [there].
24Jr 39:6 At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, and he [also] slaughtered all Judah's nobles.
24Jr 39:7 Then he blinded Zedekiah and put him in bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
24Jr 39:8 The Chaldeans next burned down the king's palace and the people's houses and tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
24Jr 39:9 Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported to Babylon the rest of the people-- those who had remained in the city and those deserters who had defected to him along with the rest of the people who had remained.
24Jr 39:10 [However,] Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and he gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
24Jr 39:11 [Speaking] through Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah, saying:
24Jr 39:12 "Take him, look after him, and don't let any harm come to him; do for him whatever he says."
24Jr 39:13 Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon
24Jr 39:14 had Jeremiah brought from the guard's courtyard and turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he settled among [his own] people.
24Jr 39:15 Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah when he was confined in the guard's courtyard:
24Jr 39:16 "Go tell Ebed-melech the Cushite: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill My words for harm and not for good against this city. They will take place before your eyes on that day.
24Jr 39:17 But I will rescue you on that day"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.
24Jr 39:18 Indeed, I will certainly deliver you so that you do not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in Me, you will keep your life like the spoils [of war]." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 40:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, released him at Ramah when he had been bound in chains with all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
24Jr 40:2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place,
24Jr 40:3 and the LORD has fulfilled [it]. He has done just what He decreed. Because you [people] have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed Him, this thing has happened.
24Jr 40:4 Now pay attention [to what I say]. Today I am setting you free from the chains that were on your hands. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look-- the whole land is in front of you. Wherever it seems good and right for you to go, go there."
24Jr 40:5 When Jeremiah had not yet turned [to go, Nebuzaradan said to him:] "Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people or go wherever you want to go." So the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him.
24Jr 40:6 Jeremiah therefore went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he stayed with him among the people who remained in the land.
24Jr 40:7 When all the commanders of the armies in the field-- they and their men-- heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children, the poorest of the land who had not been deported to Babylon,
24Jr 40:8 they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. [The commanders included] Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite-- they and their men.
24Jr 40:9 Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, "Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.
24Jr 40:10 As for me, I am going to live in Mizpah to represent [you] before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil, place them in your [storage] jars, and live in the cities you have captured."
24Jr 40:11 When all the Judeans in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in all the other lands also heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, over them,
24Jr 40:12 they all returned from all the places where they had been banished and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and harvested a great amount of wine and summer fruit.
24Jr 40:13 Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
24Jr 40:14 and warned him, "Don't you realize that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to strike you down?" But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.
24Jr 40:15 Then Johanan son of Kareah suggested to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah, "Let me go kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will know it. Why should he strike you down and scatter all of Judah that has gathered to you so that the remnant of Judah would perish?"
24Jr 40:16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam responded to Johanan son of Kareah, "Don't do that! What you're saying about Ishmael is a lie."
24Jr 41:1 In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the king's chief officers, came with 10 men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah,
24Jr 41:2 but then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the 10 men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword; he killed the one the king of Babylon had appointed in the land.
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
24Jr 41:4 On the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when no one knew [yet],
24Jr 41:5 80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria who had shaved their beards, torn their garments, and gashed themselves, and who were carrying grain and incense offerings to bring to the temple of the LORD.
24Jr 41:6 Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. When he encountered them, he said: "Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!"
24Jr 41:7 But when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
24Jr 41:8 However, there were 10 men among them who said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field-- wheat, barley, oil, and honey!" So he stopped and did not kill them along with their companions.
24Jr 41:9 Now the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men he had struck down was a large one that King Asa had made in the encounter with Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled [it] with the slain.
24Jr 41:10 Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah including the daughters of the king-- all those who remained in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:11 When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,
24Jr 41:12 they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool in Gibeon.
24Jr 41:13 When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him, they rejoiced,
24Jr 41:14 and all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and rejoined Johanan son of Kareah.
24Jr 41:15 But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:16 Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him then took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam-- men, soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he brought back from Gibeon.
24Jr 41:17 They left, stopping in Geruth Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, in order to make their way into Egypt
24Jr 41:18 away from the Chaldeans. For they feared them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed in the land.
24Jr 42:1 Then all the commanders of the armies, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jazaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached
24Jr 42:2 Jeremiah the prophet and said, "May our petition come before you; pray to the LORD your God on our behalf, on behalf of this entire remnant (for few of us remain out of the many, as you can see with your own eyes),
24Jr 42:3 that the LORD your God may tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do."
24Jr 42:4 So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard. I will now pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and every word that the LORD answers you I will tell you; I won't withhold a word from you."
24Jr 42:5 And they said to Jeremiah, "As for every word the LORD your God sends you to [tell] us, if we don't act accordingly, may the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us.
24Jr 42:6 Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you so that it may go well with us. We will certainly obey the voice of the LORD our God!"
24Jr 42:7 Now at the end of 10 days, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,
24Jr 42:8 and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
24Jr 42:9 He said to them, "This is what the LORD says, the God of Israel to whom you sent me to bring your petition before Him:
24Jr 42:10 'If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you, and I will plant and not uproot you, because I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought on you.
24Jr 42:11 Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear; don't be afraid of him'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'because I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.
24Jr 42:12 I will grant you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and allow you to return to your own soil.
24Jr 42:13 But if you say: We will not stay in this land, so as not to obey the voice of the LORD your God,
24Jr 42:14 and if you say: No, instead we'll go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram's horn or hunger for food, and we'll live there,
24Jr 42:15 then hear the word of the LORD, remnant of Judah! This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: If you are firmly resolved to go to Egypt and live there for a while,
24Jr 42:16 then the sword you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine you are worried about will follow on your heels there to Egypt, and you will die there.
24Jr 42:17 All who resolve to go to Egypt to live there for a while will die by the sword, famine, and plague. They will have no survivor or escapee from the disaster I will bring on them.'
24Jr 42:18 "For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'Just as My anger and fury were poured out on Jerusalem's residents, so will My fury pour out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of execration, scorn, cursing, and disgrace, and you will never see this place again.'
24Jr 42:19 The LORD has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah: 'Don't go to Egypt.' Know for certain that I have warned you today!
24Jr 42:20 You have led your own selves astray because you are the ones who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf, and as for all that the LORD our God says, tell it to us, and we'll act accordingly.'
24Jr 42:21 For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in everything He has sent me to [tell] you.
24Jr 42:22 Now therefore, know for certain that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place where you desired to go to live for a while."
24Jr 43:1 When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God-- all these words the LORD their God had sent him to give them--
24Jr 43:2 then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the other arrogant men responded to Jeremiah, "You are speaking a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You must not go to Egypt to live there for a while!'
24Jr 43:3 Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans to put us to death or to deport us to Babylon!"
24Jr 43:4 So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah.
24Jr 43:5 Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned from all the nations where they had been banished to live in the land of Judah for a while--
24Jr 43:6 the men, women, children, king's daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah--
24Jr 43:7 and they went to the land of Egypt because they did not obey the voice of the LORD. They went as far as Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
24Jr 43:9 "Pick up some large stones and set them in the mortar of the brick pavement that is at the opening of Pharaoh's palace at Tahpanhes. [Do this] in the sight of the Judean men
24Jr 43:10 and tell them: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will place his throne on these stones that I have embedded, and he will pitch his pavilion over them.
24Jr 43:11 He will come and strike down the land of Egypt-- those [destined] for death, to death; those [destined] for captivity, to captivity; and those [destined] for the sword, to the sword.
24Jr 43:12 I will kindle a fire in the temples of Egypt's gods, and he will burn them and take them prisoner. He will clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks lice off his garment, and he will leave there unscathed.
24Jr 43:13 He will smash the sacred pillars of the sun temple in the land of Egypt and burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods."
24Jr 44:1 [This is] the word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt-- at Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Pathros:
24Jr 44:2 "This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disaster I brought against Jerusalem and all Judah's cities; look, they are a ruin today without an inhabitant in them
24Jr 44:3 because of their evil ways that provoked Me to anger, going and burning incense to serve other gods they, you, and your fathers did not know.
24Jr 44:4 So I sent you all My servants the prophets time and time again, saying, Don't do this detestable thing that I hate.
24Jr 44:5 But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil or stop burning incense to other gods.
24Jr 44:6 So My fierce wrath poured forth and burned in Judah's cities and Jerusalem's streets so that they became the desolate ruin they are today.
24Jr 44:7 "So now, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves? You are cutting off man and woman, child and infant from Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant.
24Jr 44:8 You are provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands. You are burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live for a while. As a result, you will be cut off and become an object of cursing and insult among all the nations of earth.
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of Judah's kings, the evils of their wives, your own evils, and the evils of your wives that were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24Jr 44:10 They have not become humble to this day, and they have not feared or walked by My law or My statutes that I set before you and your ancestors.
24Jr 44:11 "Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you to [bring] disaster, to cut off all Judah.
24Jr 44:12 And I will take away the remnant of Judah, those who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to live there for a while; they will meet their end. All of them in the land of Egypt will fall by the sword; they will meet their end by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword and by famine. Then they will become an object of execration, of scorn, of cursing, and of disgrace.
24Jr 44:13 I will punish those living in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and plague.
24Jr 44:14 Then the remnant of Judah-- those going to live for a while there in the land of Egypt-- will have no fugitive or survivor to return to the land of Judah where they are longing to return to live, for they will not return except [for a few] fugitives."
24Jr 44:15 However, all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women standing by-- a great assembly-- and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt at Pathros answered Jeremiah,
24Jr 44:16 "As for the word you spoke to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you!
24Jr 44:17 Instead, we will do everything we said we would: burn incense to the queen of heaven and offer drink offerings to her just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in Judah's cities and in Jerusalem's streets. Then we had enough food and good things and saw no disaster,
24Jr 44:18 but from the time we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to offer her drink offerings, we have lacked everything, and through sword and famine we have met our end."
24Jr 44:19 And the women said, "When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it apart from our husbands' knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?"
24Jr 44:20 But Jeremiah responded to all the people-- the men, women, and all the people who were answering him-- saying,
24Jr 44:21 "As for the incense you burned in Judah's cities and in Jerusalem's streets-- you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land-- did the LORD not remember them? He brought this to mind.
24Jr 44:22 The LORD can no longer bear your evil deeds and the detestable acts you have committed, so your land has become a waste, a desolation, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as [you see] today.
24Jr 44:23 Because you burned incense and sinned against the LORD and didn't obey the LORD's voice and didn't walk in His law, His statutes, and His testimonies, this disaster has come to you, as [you see] today."
24Jr 44:24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 44:25 This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: 'As for you and your wives, you women have spoken with your mouths, and you men fulfilled it by your deeds, saying: We will keep our vows we have made to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings for her. [Go ahead,] confirm your vows! Pay your vows!'
24Jr 44:26 "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you Judeans who live in the land of Egypt: 'I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD, that My name will never again be invoked by anyone of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord God lives.
24Jr 44:27 I am watching over them for disaster and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine until they are finished off.
24Jr 44:28 Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah only few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah, the ones going to the land of Egypt to live there for a while, will know whose word stands, Mine or theirs!
24Jr 44:29 This will be a sign to you'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'that I am about to punish you in this place, so you may know that My words of disaster concerning you will certainly come to pass.
24Jr 44:30 This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand over Pharaoh Hophra, Egypt's king, to his enemies, to those who want to take his life, just as I handed over Judah's King Zedekiah to Babylon's King Nebuchadnezzar, who was his enemy, the one who wanted to take his life.'"
24Jr 45:1 [This is] the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at Jeremiah's dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
24Jr 45:2 "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
24Jr 45:3 'You have said, Woe is me, because the LORD has added misery to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.
24Jr 45:4 " 'This is what you are to say to him: This is what the LORD says: What I have built I am about to demolish, and what I have planted I am about to uproot-- the whole land!
24Jr 45:5 But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I am about to bring disaster on every living creature'-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- 'but I will grant you your life like the spoils [of war] wherever you go.'"
24Jr 46:1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations:
24Jr 46:2 About Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, Egypt's king, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Judah's King Jehoiakim son of Josiah:
24Jr 46:3 Deploy small shields and large; draw near for battle!
24Jr 46:4 Harness the horses; mount the steeds; take your positions with helmets on! Polish the lances; put on armor!
24Jr 46:5 Why have I seen [this]? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are crushed, they flee headlong, they never look back, terror is on every side! [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 46:6 The swift cannot flee, and the warrior cannot escape! In the north by the bank of the Euphrates River, they stumble and fall.
24Jr 46:7 Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters churn?
24Jr 46:8 Egypt rises like the Nile, and its waters churn like rivers. He boasts: I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities with their residents.
24Jr 46:9 Rise up, you cavalry! Race furiously, you chariots! Let the warriors go forth-- Cush and Put, who are able to handle shields, and the Ludim, who are able to handle and string the bow.
24Jr 46:10 That day belongs to the Lord, the God of Hosts, a day of vengeance to avenge Himself against His adversaries. The sword will devour and be satisfied; it will drink its fill of their blood, because it will be a sacrifice to the Lord, the God of Hosts, in the northern land by the Euphrates River.
24Jr 46:11 Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt! You have multiplied remedies in vain; there is no healing for you.
24Jr 46:12 The nations have heard of your dishonor, and your outcry fills the earth, because warrior stumbles against warrior and together both of them have fallen.
24Jr 46:13 [This is] the word the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to defeat the land of Egypt:
24Jr 46:14 Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol! Proclaim it in Memphis and in Tahpanhes! Say: Take positions! Prepare yourself, for the sword devours all around you.
24Jr 46:15 Why have your strong ones been swept away? Each has not stood, for the LORD has thrust him down.
24Jr 46:16 He continues to stumble. Indeed, each falls over the other. They say: Get up! Let's return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword that oppresses.
24Jr 46:17 There they will cry out: Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise; he let the opportune moment pass.
24Jr 46:18 As I live-- [this is] the King's declaration; the LORD of Hosts is His name. He will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
24Jr 46:19 Pack your bags for exile, inhabitant of Daughter Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolation, uninhabited ruins.
24Jr 46:20 Egypt is a beautiful young cow, but a horsefly from the north is coming against her.
24Jr 46:21 Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves. They too will turn back; together they will flee; they will not take their stand, for the day of their calamity is coming on them, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 46:22 Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake, for [the enemy] will come with an army; with axes they will come against her like those who cut trees.
24Jr 46:23 They will cut down her forest-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- though it is dense, for they are more numerous than locusts; they cannot be counted.
24Jr 46:24 Daughter Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to a northern people.
24Jr 46:25 The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to punish Amon, [god] of Thebes, along with Pharaoh, Egypt, her gods, and her kings-- Pharaoh and those trusting in him.
24Jr 46:26 I will hand them over to those who want to take their lives-- to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But after this, it will be inhabited again as in ancient times." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 46:27 But you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid, and do not be discouraged, Israel, for without fail I will save you from far away and your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him.
24Jr 46:28 And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, but I will by no means leave you unpunished.
24Jr 47:1 [This is] the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before Pharaoh defeated Gaza.
24Jr 47:2 This is what the LORD says: Look, waters are rising from the north and becoming an overflowing wadi. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the cities and their inhabitants. The people will cry out, and every inhabitant of the land will wail.
24Jr 47:3 At the sound of the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, and the clatter of their wheels, fathers will not turn back for their sons, because they will be utterly helpless
24Jr 47:4 on account of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. Indeed, the LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the islands of Caphtor.
24Jr 47:5 Baldness is coming to Gaza. Ashkelon will become silent, a remnant of their valley. How long will you gash yourself?
24Jr 47:6 Ah, sword of the LORD! How long will you be restless? Go back to your scabbard; be still; be silent!
24Jr 47:7 How can it rest when the LORD has given it a command? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and the shore of the sea.
24Jr 48:1 About Moab, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Woe to Nebo, because it is about to be destroyed; Kiriathaim will be put to shame; it will be taken captive. The fortress will be put to shame and dismayed!
24Jr 48:2 There is no longer praise for Moab; they plan harm against her in Heshbon: Come, let's cut her off from nationhood. You madmen will also be silenced; the sword will pursue you.
24Jr 48:3 A voice cries out from Horonaim: devastation and great disaster!
24Jr 48:4 Moab will be shattered; her little ones will cry out.
24Jr 48:5 For on the ascent to Luhith they will be weeping continually, and on the descent to Horonaim will be heard cries of distress over the destruction:
24Jr 48:6 Flee! Save your lives! Be like a juniper bushin the wilderness.
24Jr 48:7 Because you trust in your works and treasures, you will be captured also. Chemosh will go into exile with his priests and officials.
24Jr 48:8 The destroyer will move against every town; not one town will escape. The valley will perish, and the plain will be annihilated, as the LORD has said.
24Jr 48:9 Make Moab a salt marsh, for she will run away; her towns will become a desolation, without inhabitant.
24Jr 48:10 Cursed is the one who does the LORD's business deceitfully, and cursed is the one who withholds his sword from bloodshed.
24Jr 48:11 Moab has been left quiet since his youth, settled [like wine] on its dregs. He hasn't been poured from one container to another or gone into exile. So his taste has remained the same, and his aroma hasn't changed.
24Jr 48:12 Therefore look, the days are coming-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- when I will send those to him, who will pour him out. They will empty his containers and smash his jars.
24Jr 48:13 Moab will be put to shame because of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was put to shame because of Bethel that they trusted in.
24Jr 48:14 How can you say, We are warriors-- mighty men [ready] for battle?
24Jr 48:15 The destroyer of Moab and its towns has come up, and the best of its young men have gone down to slaughter. [This is] the King's declaration; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
24Jr 48:16 Moab's calamity is near at hand; his disaster is rushing swiftly.
24Jr 48:17 Mourn for him, all you surrounding [nations], everyone who knows his name. Say: How the mighty scepter is shattered, the glorious staff!
24Jr 48:18 Come down from glory; sit on parched ground, resident of the daughter of Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has destroyed your fortresses.
24Jr 48:19 Stand by the highway and look, resident of Aroer! Ask him who is fleeing or her who is escaping, What happened?
24Jr 48:20 Moab is put to shame, indeed dismayed. Wail and cry out! Declare by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
24Jr 48:21 "Judgment has come to the land of the plateau-- to Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,
24Jr 48:22 Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim,
24Jr 48:23 Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
24Jr 48:24 Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, those far and near.
24Jr 48:25 Moab's horn is chopped off; his arm is shattered." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 48:26 "Make him drunk, because he has exalted himself against the LORD. Moab will wallow in his own vomit, and he will also become a laughingstock.
24Jr 48:27 Wasn't Israel a laughingstock to you? Was he ever found among thieves? For whenever you speak of him you shake [your head]."
24Jr 48:28 Abandon the towns! Live in the cliffs, residents of Moab! Be like a dove that nests inside the mouth of a cave.
24Jr 48:29 We have heard of Moab's pride, great pride, indeed-- his insolence, arrogance, pride, and haughty heart.
24Jr 48:30 I know his outburst. [This is] the LORD's declaration. It is empty. His boast is empty.
24Jr 48:31 Therefore, I will wail over Moab. I will cry out for Moab, all of it; he will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
24Jr 48:32 I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah, with more than the weeping for Jazer. Your tendrils have extended to the sea; they have reached to the sea [and to] Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruit and grape harvest.
24Jr 48:33 Joy and celebration are taken from the fertile field and from the land of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses; no one will tread with shouts of joy. The shouting is not a shout of joy.
24Jr 48:34 "There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they raise their voices as far as Jahaz-- from Zoar to Horonaim [and] Eglath-shelishiyah-- because even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.
24Jr 48:35 In Moab, I will stop"-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- "the one who offers sacrifices on the high place and burns incense to his gods.
24Jr 48:36 Therefore, My heart moans like flutes for Moab, and My heart moans like flutes for the people of Kir-heres. And therefore, the wealth he has gained has perished.
24Jr 48:37 Indeed, every head is bald and every beard clipped; on every hand is a gash and sackcloth around the waist.
24Jr 48:38 On all the rooftops of Moab and in her public squares, everyone is mourning because I have shattered Moab like a jar no one wants." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 48:39 "How broken it is! They wail! How Moab has turned his back! He is ashamed. Moab will become a laughingstock and a shock to all those around him."
24Jr 48:40 For this is what the LORD says: He will swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Moab.
24Jr 48:41 The towns have been captured, and the strongholds seized. In that day the heart of Moab's warriors will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
24Jr 48:42 Moab will be destroyed as a people because he has exalted himself against the LORD.
24Jr 48:43 Panic, pit, and trap await you, resident of Moab. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 48:44 He who flees from the panic will fall in the pit, and he who climbs from the pit will be captured in the trap, for I will bring against Moab the year of their punishment. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 48:45 Those who flee will stand exhausted in Heshbon's shadow because fire has come out from Heshbon and a flame from within Sihon. It will devour Moab's forehead and the skull of the noisemakers.
24Jr 48:46 Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished because your sons have been taken captive and your daughters have gone into captivity.
24Jr 48:47 Yet, I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the last days. [This is] the LORD's declaration. The judgment on Moab ends here.
24Jr 49:1 About the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: Does Israel have no sons? Is he without an heir? Why then has Milcomdispossessed Gad and his people settled in their cities?
24Jr 49:2 Therefore look, the days are coming-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- when I will make the shout of battle heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its villages will be burned down. Israel will dispossess their dispossessors, says the LORD.
24Jr 49:3 Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, daughters of Rabbah! Clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and lament; run back and forth within your walls, because Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials.
24Jr 49:4 Why do you brag about your valleys, your flowing valley, you faithless daughter? You who trust in your treasures [and boast]: Who can attack me?
24Jr 49:5 Look, I am about to bring terror on you-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord, the God of Hosts-- from all those around you. You will be banished, each man headlong, with no one to gather up the fugitives.
24Jr 49:6 But after that, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 49:7 About Edom, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom rotted away?
24Jr 49:8 Run! Turn back! Lie low, residents of Dedan, for I will bring Esau's calamity on him at the time I punish him.
24Jr 49:9 If grape harvesters came to you, wouldn't they leave some gleanings? Were thieves to come in the night, they would destroy only what they wanted.
24Jr 49:10 But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his secret places. He will try to hide himself, but he will be unable. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors. He will exist no longer.
24Jr 49:11 Abandon your orphans; I will preserve them; let your widows trust in Me.
24Jr 49:12 "For this is what the LORD says: If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, can you possibly remain unpunished? You will not remain unpunished, for you must drink [it] too.
24Jr 49:13 For by Myself I have sworn"-- the LORD's declaration-- "Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse, and all her cities will become ruins forever."
24Jr 49:14 I have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent among the nations: Assemble yourselves to come against her. Rise up for war!
24Jr 49:15 Look, I will certainly make you insignificant among the nations, despised among humanity.
24Jr 49:16 As to the terror you cause, your presumptuous heart has deceived you. You who live in the clefts of the rock, you who occupy the mountain summit, though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 49:17 "Edom will become a desolation. Everyone who passes by her will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.
24Jr 49:18 As when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors," says the LORD, "no one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a resident alien.
24Jr 49:19 "Look, it will be like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to the perennially watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Edom away from her [land] in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?"
24Jr 49:20 Therefore, hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Edom and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman: The flock's little lambs will certainly be dragged away, and their grazing land will be made desolate because of them.
24Jr 49:21 At the sound of their fall the earth will quake; the sound of her cry will be heard at the Red Sea.
24Jr 49:22 Look! It will be like an eagle soaring upward, then swooping down and spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom's warriors will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
24Jr 49:23 About Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard a bad report and are agitated; in the sea there is anxiety that cannot be calmed.
24Jr 49:24 Damascus has become weak; she has turned to run; panic has gripped her. Distress and labor pains have seized her like a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:25 How can the city of praise not be abandoned, the town that brings Me joy?
24Jr 49:26 Therefore, her young men will fall in her public squares; all the warriors will be silenced in that day. [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
24Jr 49:27 I will set fire to the wall of Damascus; it will devour Ben-hadad's citadels.
24Jr 49:28 About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's king, defeated, this is what the LORD says: Rise up, go against Kedar, and destroy the people of the east!
24Jr 49:29 They will take their tents and their flocks along with their tent curtains and all their equipment. They will take their camels for themselves. They will call out to them: Terror is on every side!
24Jr 49:30 Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, residents of Hazor-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you.
24Jr 49:31 Rise up, go up against a nation at ease, one living in security. [This is] the LORD's declaration. They have no doors, not even a gate bar; they live alone.
24Jr 49:32 Their camels will become plunder, and their massive herds of cattle will become spoil. I will scatter them to the wind in every direction, those who shave their temples; I will bring calamity on them across all their borders. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 49:33 Hazor will become a jackals' den, a desolation forever. No one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a resident alien.
24Jr 49:34 [This is] the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
24Jr 49:35 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: I am about to shatter Elam's bow, the source of their might.
24Jr 49:36 I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will not be a nation to which Elam's banished ones will not go.
24Jr 49:37 I will devastate Elam before their enemies, before those who want to take their lives. I will bring disaster on them, My burning anger. [This is] the LORD's declaration. I will send the sword after them until I finish them off.
24Jr 49:38 I will set My throne in Elam, and I will destroy the king and officials from there. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 49:39 In the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 50:1 The word the LORD spoke about Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:
24Jr 50:2 Announce to the nations; proclaim and raise up a signal flag; proclaim, and hide nothing. Say: Babylon is captured; Bel is put to shame; Marduk is devastated; her idols are put to shame; her false gods, devastated.
24Jr 50:3 For a nation from the north will come against her; it will make her land desolate. No one will be living in it-- both man and beast will escape.
24Jr 50:4 In those days and at that time-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- the Israelites and Judeans will come together, weeping as they come, and will seek the LORD their God.
24Jr 50:5 They will ask about Zion, [turning] their faces to this road. They will come and join themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
24Jr 50:6 My people are lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, guiding them the wrong way in the mountains. They have wandered from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.
24Jr 50:7 All who found them devoured them. Their adversaries said: We're not guilty; instead, they have sinned against the LORD, their righteous grazing land, the hope of their ancestors, the LORD.
24Jr 50:8 Escape from Babylon; depart from the Chaldeans' land. Be like the rams that lead the flock.
24Jr 50:9 For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country. They will line up in battle formation against her; from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
24Jr 50:10 The Chaldeans will become plunder; all her plunderers will be fully satisfied. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 50:11 Because you rejoice, because you sing in triumph-- you who plundered My inheritance-- because you frolic like a young cow treading grain and neigh like stallions,
24Jr 50:12 your mother will be utterly humiliated; she who bore you will be put to shame. Look! She will lag behind all the nations-- a dry land, a wilderness, an Arabah.
24Jr 50:13 Because of the LORD's wrath, she will not be inhabited; she will become a desolation, every bit of her. Everyone who passes through Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.
24Jr 50:14 Line up in battle formation around Babylon, all you archers! Shoot at her! Do not spare an arrow, for she has sinned against the LORD.
24Jr 50:15 Raise a war cry against her on every side! She has thrown up her hands [in surrender]; her defense towers have fallen; her walls are demolished. Since this is the LORD's vengeance, take out your vengeance on her; as she has done, do the same to her.
24Jr 50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon as well as him who wields the sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor's sword, each will turn to his own people, each will flee to his own land.
24Jr 50:17 Israel is a stray lamb, chased by lions. The first who devoured him was the king of Assyria; this last who has crunched his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
24Jr 50:18 Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: "I am about to punish the king of Babylon and his land just as I punished the king of Assyria.
24Jr 50:19 I will return Israel to his grazing land, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan; he will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and of Gilead.
24Jr 50:20 In those days and at that time-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- one will search for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for Judah's sins, but they will not be found, for I will forgive those I leave as a remnant.
24Jr 50:21 Go against the land of Merathaim, and against those living in Pekod. Put them to the sword; completely destroy them-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- do everything I have commanded you.
24Jr 50:22 The sound of war is in the land-- a great destruction.
24Jr 50:23 How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and smashed! What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
24Jr 50:24 Babylon, I laid a trap for you, and you were caught, but you did not even know it. You were found and captured because you fought against the LORD.
24Jr 50:25 The LORD opened His armory and brought out His weapons of wrath, because it is a task of the Lord God of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 50:26 Come against her from the most distant places. Open her granaries; pile her up like mounds of grain and completely destroy her. Leave her no survivors.
24Jr 50:27 Put all her young bulls to the sword; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, because their day has come, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 50:28 [There is] a voice of fugitives and escapees from the land of Babylon announcing in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance for His temple.
24Jr 50:29 Summon the archers to Babylon, all who string the bow; camp all around her; let none escape. Repay her according to her deeds; just as she has done, do the same to her, for she has acted arrogantly against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 50:30 Therefore, her young men will fall in her public squares; all the warriors will be silenced in that day. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 50:31 Look, I am against you, you arrogant one-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts-- because your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
24Jr 50:32 The arrogant will stumble and fall with no one to pick him up. I will set fire to his cities, and it will consume everything around him."
24Jr 50:33 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Israelites and Judeans alike have been oppressed. All their captors hold them fast; they refuse to release them.
24Jr 50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of Hosts is His name. He will fervently plead their case so that He might bring rest to the earth but turmoil to those who live in Babylon.
24Jr 50:35 A sword is over the Chaldeans-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- against those who live in Babylon, against her officials, and against her sages.
24Jr 50:36 A sword is against the diviners, and they will act foolishly. A sword is against her heroic warriors, and they will be terrified.
24Jr 50:37 A sword is against his horses and chariots and against all the foreigners among them, and they will be like women. A sword is against her treasuries, and they will be plundered.
24Jr 50:38 A drought will come on her waters, and they will be dried up. For it is a land of carved images, and they go mad because of terrifying things.
24Jr 50:39 Therefore, desert creatures will live with jackals, and ostriches will also live in her. It will never again be inhabited or lived in through all generations.
24Jr 50:40 Just as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- so no one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a resident alien.
24Jr 50:41 Look! A people comes from the north. A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the remote regions of the earth.
24Jr 50:42 They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter of Babylon.
24Jr 50:43 The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands fall helpless. Distress has seized him-- pain, like a woman in labor.
24Jr 50:44 "Look, it will be like a lion coming up from the thickets of the Jordan to the perennially watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Babylon away from her [land] in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?"
24Jr 50:45 Therefore, hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Babylon and the strategies He has devised against the land of the Chaldeans: Certainly the flock's little lambs will be dragged away; certainly the grazing land will be made desolate because of them.
24Jr 50:46 At the sound of Babylon's conquest the earth will quake; a cry will be heard among the nations.
24Jr 51:1 This is what the LORD says: I am about to stir up a destructive wind against Babylon and against the population of Leb-qamai.
24Jr 51:2 I will send strangers to Babylon who will scatter her and strip her land bare, for they will come against her from every side in the day of disaster.
24Jr 51:3 Don't let the archer string his bow; don't let him put on his armor. Don't spare her young men; completely destroy her entire army!
24Jr 51:4 Those who were slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, those who were pierced through, in her streets.
24Jr 51:5 For Israel and Judah are not left widowed by their God, the LORD of Hosts, though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 51:6 Leave Babylon; save your lives, each of you! Don't be silenced by her guilt. For this is the time of the LORD's vengeance-- He will pay her what she deserves.
24Jr 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore, the nations go mad.
24Jr 51:8 Suddenly Babylon fell and was shattered. Wail for her; get balm for her wound-- perhaps she can be healed.
24Jr 51:9 We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed. Abandon her! Let each of us go to his own land, for her judgment extends to the sky and reaches as far as the clouds.
24Jr 51:10 The LORD has brought about our vindication; come, let's tell in Zion what the LORD our God has accomplished.
24Jr 51:11 Sharpen the arrows! Fill the quivers! The LORD has put it into the mind of the kings of the Medes because His plan is aimed at Babylon to destroy her, for it is the LORD's vengeance, vengeance for His temple.
24Jr 51:12 Raise up a signal flag against the walls of Babylon; fortify the watch post; set the watchmen in place; prepare the ambush. For the LORD has both planned and accomplished what He has threatened against those who live in Babylon.
24Jr 51:13 You who reside by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, your life thread is cut.
24Jr 51:14 The LORD of Hosts has sworn by Himself: I will fill you up with men as with locusts, and they will sing the victory song over you.
24Jr 51:15 He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding.
24Jr 51:16 When He thunders, the waters in the heavens are in turmoil, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
24Jr 51:17 Everyone is stupid and ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by [his] carved image, for his cast images are a lie; there is no breath in them.
24Jr 51:18 They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed.
24Jr 51:19 Jacob's Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. [Israel is] the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
24Jr 51:20 You are My battle club, My weapons of war. With you I will smash nations; with you I will bring kingdoms to ruin.
24Jr 51:21 With you I will smash the horse and its rider; with you I will smash the chariot and its rider.
24Jr 51:22 With you I will smash man and woman; with you I will smash the old man and the youth; with you I will smash the young man and the virgin.
24Jr 51:23 With you I will smash the shepherd and his flock; with you I will smash the farmer and his ox-team. With you I will smash governors and officials.
24Jr 51:24 "I will repay Babylon and all the residents of Chaldea for all their evil they have done in Zion before your very eyes." [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 51:25 Look, I am against you, devastating mountain-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- you devastate the whole earth. I will stretch out My hand against you, roll you down from the cliffs, and turn you into a burned-out mountain.
24Jr 51:26 No one will be able to retrieve a cornerstone or a foundation stone from you, because you will become desolate forever. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 51:27 Raise a signal flag in the land; blow a ram's horn among the nations; set apart the nations against her. Summon kingdoms against her-- Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her; bring up horses like a swarm of locusts.
24Jr 51:28 Set apart the nations for battle against her-- the kings of Media, her governors and all her officials, and all the lands they rule.
24Jr 51:29 The earth quakes and trembles, because the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand: to make the land of Babylon an uninhabited desolation.
24Jr 51:30 Babylon's warriors have stopped fighting; they sit in their strongholds. Their might is exhausted; they have become like women. Babylon's homes have been set ablaze, her gate bars are shattered.
24Jr 51:31 Messenger races to meet messenger, and herald to meet herald, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured from end [to end].
24Jr 51:32 The fords have been seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers are terrified.
24Jr 51:33 For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled. In just a little while her harvest time will come.
24Jr 51:34 "Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me. He has set me aside like an empty dish; he has swallowed me like a sea monster; he filled his belly with my delicacies; he has vomited me out,"
24Jr 51:35 says the inhabitant of Zion; "Let the violence [done] to me and my family [be done] to Babylon. Let my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea," says Jerusalem.
24Jr 51:36 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to plead your case and take vengeance on your behalf; I will dry up her sea and make her fountain run dry.
24Jr 51:37 Babylon will become a heap of rubble, a jackals' den, a desolation and an object of scorn, without inhabitant.
24Jr 51:38 They will roar together like young lions; they will growl like lion cubs.
24Jr 51:39 While they are flushed with heat, I will serve them a feast, and I will make them drunk so that they revel. Then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 51:40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams together with male goats.
24Jr 51:41 How Sheshach has been captured, the praise of the whole earth seized. What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
24Jr 51:42 The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with its turbulent waves.
24Jr 51:43 Her cities have become a desolation, a dry and arid land, a land where no one lives, where no human being passes through.
24Jr 51:44 I will punish Bel in Babylon. I will make him vomit what he swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him; even Babylon's wall will fall.
24Jr 51:45 Come out from among her, My people! Save your lives, each of you, from the LORD's burning anger.
24Jr 51:46 May you not become faint-hearted and fearful when the report is proclaimed in the land, for the report will come one year, and then another the next year. There will be violence in the land with ruler against ruler.
24Jr 51:47 Therefore, look, the days are coming when I will punish Babylon's carved images. Her entire land will suffer shame, and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
24Jr 51:48 Heaven and earth and everything in them will shout for joy over Babylon because the destroyers from the north will come against her. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 51:49 Babylon must fall [because of] the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth fell because of Babylon.
24Jr 51:50 You who have escaped the sword, go and do not stand still! Remember the LORD from far away, and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
24Jr 51:51 We are ashamed because we have heard insults. Humiliation covers our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's temple.
24Jr 51:52 Therefore, look, the days are coming-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- when I will punish her carved images, and the wounded will groan throughout her land.
24Jr 51:53 Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens and fortify her tall fortresses, destroyers will come against her from Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
24Jr 51:54 The sound of a cry from Babylon! The sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
24Jr 51:55 For the LORD is going to devastate Babylon; He will silence her mighty voice. Their waves roar like abundant waters; the tumult of their voice resounds,
24Jr 51:56 for a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon. Her warriors will be captured, their bows shattered, for the LORD is a God of retribution; He will certainly repay.
24Jr 51:57 I will make her princes and sages drunk, along with her governors, officials, and warriors. Then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up. [This is] the King's declaration; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
24Jr 51:58 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Babylon's thick walls will be totally demolished, and her high gates consumed by fire. The peoples will have labored for nothing; the nations will exhaust themselves [only to feed] the fire.
24Jr 51:59 [This is] what Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, the quartermaster, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah's reign.
24Jr 51:60 Jeremiah wrote on one scroll about all the disaster that would come to Babylon; all these words were written against Babylon.
24Jr 51:61 Jeremiah told Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.
24Jr 51:62 You must say, 'LORD, You have threatened to cut off this place so that no one will live in it-- man or beast. Indeed, it will remain desolate forever.'
24Jr 51:63 When you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
24Jr 51:64 Then say, 'In the same way, Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am bringing on her. They will grow weary.' " The words of Jeremiah end here.
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king; he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; [she was] from Libnah.
24Jr 52:2 Zedekiah did what was evil in the LORD's sight just as Jehoiakim had done.
24Jr 52:3 Because of the LORD's anger, it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He finally banished them from His presence. Nevertheless, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24Jr 52:4 In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army. They laid siege to the city and built a siege wall all around it.
24Jr 52:5 The city was under siege until King Zedekiah's eleventh year.
24Jr 52:6 By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that the people of the land had no food.
24Jr 52:7 Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors fled. They left the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They made their way along the route to the Arabah.
24Jr 52:8 The Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. Zedekiah's entire army was scattered from him.
24Jr 52:9 The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
24Jr 52:10 At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes and also slaughtered the Judean commanders.
24Jr 52:11 Then he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze chains. The king of Babylon brought Zedekiah to Babylon, where he kept him in custody until his dying day.
24Jr 52:12 On the tenth day of the fifth month-- which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon-- Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, entered Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 52:13 He burned the LORD's temple, the king's palace, all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the nobles.
24Jr 52:14 The whole Chaldean army with the commander of the guards tore down all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:15 Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported some of the poorest of the people, as well as the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
24Jr 52:16 But some of the poor people of the land Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left to be vinedressers and farmers.
24Jr 52:17 Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars for the LORD's temple and the water carts and the bronze reservoir that were in the LORD's temple, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24Jr 52:18 They took the pots, the shovels, the wick trimmers, the sprinkling basins, the dishes, and all the bronze articles used in [temple] service.
24Jr 52:19 The commander of the guards took away the bowls, the firepans, the sprinkling basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans, and the drink offering bowls-- whatever was gold or silver.
24Jr 52:20 As for the two pillars, the one reservoir, and the 12 bronze bulls under the water carts that King Solomon had made for the LORD's temple, the weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.
24Jr 52:21 One pillar was 27 feet tall, had a circumference of 18 feet, was hollow-- four fingers thick--
24Jr 52:22 and had a bronze capital on top of it. One capital, encircled by bronze latticework and pomegranates, stood seven and a half feet high. The second pillar was the same, with pomegranates.
24Jr 52:23 [Each capital had] 96 pomegranates all around it. All the pomegranates around the latticework numbered 100.
24Jr 52:24 The commander of the guards also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
24Jr 52:25 From the city he took a court official who had been appointed over the warriors; seven trusted royal aides found in the city; the secretary of the commander of the army, who enlisted the people of the land for military duty; and 60 men from the common people who were found within the city.
24Jr 52:26 Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24Jr 52:27 The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah went into exile from its land.
24Jr 52:28 These are the people Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
24Jr 52:29 in his eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
24Jr 52:30 in Nebuchadnezzar's twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported 745 Jews. All together 4,600 people [were deported].
24Jr 52:31 On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah's King Jehoiachin, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from the prison.
24Jr 52:32 He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
24Jr 52:33 So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly in the presence of the king of Babylon for the rest of his life.
24Jr 52:34 As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, for the rest of his life.

25Lm 1:1 How she sits alone, the city [once] crowded with people! She who was great among the nations has become like a widow. The princess among the provinces has become a slave.
25Lm 1:2 She weeps aloud during the night, with tears on her cheeks. There is no one to offer her comfort, [not one] from all her lovers. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
25Lm 1:3 Judah has gone into exile following affliction and harsh slavery; she lives among the nations but finds no place to rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her in narrow places.
25Lm 1:4 The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to the appointed festivals. All her gates are deserted; her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she herself is bitter.
25Lm 1:5 Her adversaries have become [her] masters; her enemies are at ease, for the LORD has made her suffer because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone away as captives before the adversary.
25Lm 1:6 All her splendor has vanished from Daughter Zion. Her leaders are like stags that find no pasture; they walk away exhausted before the hunter.
25Lm 1:7 During the days of her affliction and homelessness Jerusalem remembers all her precious belongings that were [hers] in days of old. When her people fell into the adversary's hand, she had no one to help. The adversaries looked at her, laughing over her downfall.
25Lm 1:8 Jerusalem has sinned grievously; therefore, she has become an object of scorn. All who honored her [now] despise her, for they have seen her nakedness. She herself groans and turns away.
25Lm 1:9 Her uncleanness [stains] her skirts. She never considered her end. Her downfall was astonishing; there was no one to comfort her. LORD, look on my affliction, for the enemy triumphs!
25Lm 1:10 The adversary has seized all her precious belongings. She has even seen the nations enter her sanctuary-- those You had forbidden to enter Your assembly.
25Lm 1:11 All her people groan while they search for bread. They have traded their precious belongings for food in order to stay alive. LORD, look and see how I have become despised.
25Lm 1:12 Is this nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see! Is there any pain like mine, which was dealt out to me, which the LORD made [me] suffer on the day of His burning anger?
25Lm 1:13 He sent fire from on high into my bones; He made it descend. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, sick all day long.
25Lm 1:14 My transgressions have been formed into a yoke, fastened together by His hand; they have been placed on my neck, and the Lord has broken my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.
25Lm 1:15 The Lord has rejected all the mighty men within me. He has summoned an army against me to crush my young warriors. The Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah [like grapes] in a winepress.
25Lm 1:16 I weep because of these things; my eyes flow with tears. For there is no one nearby to comfort [me], no one to keep me alive. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.
25Lm 1:17 Zion stretches out her hands; there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has issued a decree against Jacob that his neighbors should be his adversaries. Jerusalem has become something impure among them.
25Lm 1:18 The LORD is in the right, for I have rebelled against His command. Listen, all you people; look at my pain. My young men and women have gone into captivity.
25Lm 1:19 I called to my lovers, but they betrayed me. My priests and elders perished in the city while searching for food to keep themselves alive.
25Lm 1:20 LORD, see how I am in distress. I am churning within; my heart is broken, for I have been very rebellious. Outside, the sword takes the children; inside, there is death.
25Lm 1:21 People have heard me groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my misfortune; they are glad that You have caused [it]. Bring on the day You have announced, so that they may become like me.
25Lm 1:22 Let all their wickedness come before You, and deal with them as You have dealt with me because of all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and I am sick at heart.
25Lm 2:1 How the Lord has overshadowed Daughter Zion with His anger! He has thrown down Israel's glory from heaven to earth. He has abandoned His footstool in the day of His anger.
25Lm 2:2 Without compassion the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob. In His wrath He has demolished the fortified cities of Daughter Judah. He brought [them] to the ground and defiled the kingdom and its leaders.
25Lm 2:3 He has cut off every horn of Israel in His burning anger and withdrawn His right hand in the presence of the enemy. He has blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything [in its path].
25Lm 2:4 Like an enemy He has bent His bow; His right hand is positioned like an adversary. He has killed everyone who was loved, pouring out His wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion.
25Lm 2:5 The Lord is like an enemy; He has swallowed up Israel. He swallowed up all its palaces and destroyed its fortified cities. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation within Daughter Judah.
25Lm 2:6 He has done violence to His temple as if [it were] a garden [booth], destroying His place of meeting. The LORD has abolished appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion. He has despised king and priest in His fierce anger.
25Lm 2:7 The Lord has rejected His altar, repudiated His sanctuary; He has handed the walls of her palaces over to the enemy. They have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed festival.
25Lm 2:8 The LORD determined to destroy the wall of Daughter Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not restrain Himself from destroying. He made the ramparts and walls grieve; together they waste away.
25Lm 2:9 Zion's gates have fallen to the ground; He has destroyed and shattered the bars on her [gates]. Her king and her leaders [live] among the nations, instruction is no more, and even her prophets receive no vision from the LORD.
25Lm 2:10 The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence. They have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
25Lm 2:11 My eyes are worn out from weeping; I am churning within. My heart is poured out in grief because of the destruction of my dear people, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
25Lm 2:12 They cry out to their mothers: Where is the grain and wine? as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives fade away in the arms of their mothers.
25Lm 2:13 What can I say on your behalf? To what can I compare you, Daughter Jerusalem? What can I liken you to, so that I may console you, Virgin Daughter Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea. Who can heal you?
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets saw visions for you that were empty and deceptive; they did not reveal your guilt and so restore your fortunes. They saw oracles for you that were empty and misleading.
25Lm 2:15 All who pass by [scornfully] clap their hands at you. They hiss and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem: Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?
25Lm 2:16 All your enemies open their mouths against you. They hiss and gnash [their] teeth, saying, "We have swallowed [her] up. This is the day we have waited for! We have lived to see [it]."
25Lm 2:17 The LORD has done what He planned; He has accomplished His decree, which He ordained in days of old. He has demolished without compassion, letting the enemy gloat over you and exalting the horn of your adversaries.
25Lm 2:18 The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. Wall of Daughter Zion, let [your] tears run down like a river day and night. Give yourself no relief and your eyes no rest.
25Lm 2:19 Arise, cry out in the night, from the first watch of the night. Pour out your heart like water before the Lord's presence. Lift up your hands to Him for the lives of your children who are fainting from hunger on the corner of every street.
25Lm 2:20 LORD, look and consider who You have done this to. Should women eat their own children, the infants they have nurtured? Should priests and prophets be killed in the Lord's sanctuary?
25Lm 2:21 [Both] young and old are lying on the ground in the streets. My young men and women have fallen by the sword. You have killed [them] in the day of Your anger, slaughtering without compassion.
25Lm 2:22 You summoned my attackers on every side, as if [for] an appointed festival day; on the day of the LORD's anger no one escaped or survived. My enemy has destroyed those I nurtured and reared.
25Lm 3:1 I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God's wrath.
25Lm 3:2 He has driven me away and forced [me] to walk in darkness instead of light.
25Lm 3:3 Yes, He repeatedly turns His hand against me all day long.
25Lm 3:4 He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones.
25Lm 3:5 He has laid siege against me, encircling me with bitterness and hardship.
25Lm 3:6 He has made me dwell in darkness like those who have been dead for ages.
25Lm 3:7 He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains.
25Lm 3:8 Even when I cry out and plead for help, He rejects my prayer.
25Lm 3:9 He has walled in my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked.
25Lm 3:10 He is a bear waiting in ambush, a lion in hiding;
25Lm 3:11 He forced me off my way and tore me to pieces; He left me desolate.
25Lm 3:12 He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow.
25Lm 3:13 He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.
25Lm 3:14 I am a laughingstock to all my people, mocked by their songs all day long.
25Lm 3:15 He filled me with bitterness, sated me with wormwood.
25Lm 3:16 He ground my teeth on gravel and made me cower in the dust.
25Lm 3:17 My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is.
25Lm 3:18 Then I thought: My future is lost, as well as my hope from the LORD.
25Lm 3:19 Remember my affliction and my homelessness, the wormwood and the poison.
25Lm 3:20 I continually remember [them] and have become depressed.
25Lm 3:21 Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope:
25Lm 3:22 [Because of] the LORD's faithful love we do not perish, for His mercies never end.
25Lm 3:23 They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!
25Lm 3:24 I say: The LORD is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in Him.
25Lm 3:25 The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the person who seeks Him.
25Lm 3:26 It is good to wait quietly for deliverance from the LORD.
25Lm 3:27 It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is [still] young.
25Lm 3:28 Let him sit alone and be silent, for God has disciplined him.
25Lm 3:29 Let him put his mouth in the dust-- perhaps there is [still] hope.
25Lm 3:30 Let him offer [his] cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with shame.
25Lm 3:31 For the Lord will not reject [us] forever.
25Lm 3:32 Even if He causes suffering, He will show compassion according to His abundant, faithful love.
25Lm 3:33 For He does not enjoy bringing affliction or suffering on mankind.
25Lm 3:34 Crushing all the prisoners of the land beneath one's feet,
25Lm 3:35 denying justice to a man in the presence of the Most High,
25Lm 3:36 or suppressing a person's lawsuit-- the Lord does not approve [of these things].
25Lm 3:37 Who is there who speaks and it happens, unless the Lord has ordained [it]?
25Lm 3:38 Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
25Lm 3:39 Why should [any] living person complain, [any] man, because of the punishment for his sins?
25Lm 3:40 Let us search out and examine our ways, and turn back to the LORD.
25Lm 3:41 Let us lift up our hearts and [our] hands to God in heaven:
25Lm 3:42 We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.
25Lm 3:43 You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without compassion.
25Lm 3:44 You have covered Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
25Lm 3:45 You have made us disgusting filth among the peoples.
25Lm 3:46 All our enemies open their mouths against us.
25Lm 3:47 We have experienced panic and pitfall, devastation and destruction.
25Lm 3:48 My eyes flow with streams of tears because of the destruction of my dear people.
25Lm 3:49 My eyes overflow unceasingly, without end,
25Lm 3:50 until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.
25Lm 3:51 My eyes bring me grief because of [the fate of] all the women in my city.
25Lm 3:52 For no [apparent] reason, my enemies hunted me like a bird.
25Lm 3:53 They dropped me alive into a pit and threw stones at me.
25Lm 3:54 Water flooded over my head, and I thought: I'm going to die!
25Lm 3:55 I called on Your name, Yahweh, from the depths of the Pit.
25Lm 3:56 You hear my plea: Do not ignore my cry for relief.
25Lm 3:57 You come near when I call on You; You say: "Do not be afraid."
25Lm 3:58 You defend my cause, Lord; You redeem my life.
25Lm 3:59 LORD, You see the wrong done to me; judge my case.
25Lm 3:60 You see all their malice, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:61 LORD, You hear their insults, all their plots against me.
25Lm 3:62 The slander and murmuring of my opponents attack me all day long.
25Lm 3:63 When they sit and when they rise, look, I am mocked by their songs.
25Lm 3:64 You will pay them back what they deserve, LORD, according to the work of their hands.
25Lm 3:65 You will give them a heart filled with anguish. May Your curse be on them!
25Lm 3:66 You will pursue [them] in anger and destroy them under Your heavens.
25Lm 4:1 How the gold has become tarnished, the fine gold become dull! The stones of the temple lie scattered at the corner of every street.
25Lm 4:2 Zion's precious people-- [once] worth their weight in pure gold-- how they are regarded as clay jars, the work of a potter's hands!
25Lm 4:3 Even jackals offer [their] breasts to nurse their young, but my dear people have become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:4 The nursing infant's tongue clings to the roof of his mouth from thirst. Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them [any].
25Lm 4:5 Those who used to eat delicacies are destitute in the streets; those who were reared in purple [garments] huddle in garbage heaps.
25Lm 4:6 The punishment of my dear people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand laid on it.
25Lm 4:7 Her dignitaries were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; [their] bodies were more ruddy than coral, their appearance [like] sapphire.
25Lm 4:8 [Now] they appear darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become dry like wood.
25Lm 4:9 Those slain by the sword are better off than those slain by hunger, who waste away, pierced [with pain] because the fields lack produce.
25Lm 4:10 The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children; they became their food during the destruction of my dear people.
25Lm 4:11 The LORD has exhausted His wrath, poured out His burning anger; He has ignited a fire in Zion, and it has consumed her foundations.
25Lm 4:12 The kings of the earth and all the world's inhabitants did not believe that an enemy or adversary could enter Jerusalem's gates.
25Lm 4:13 [Yet it happened] because of the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous within her.
25Lm 4:14 Blind, they stumbled in the streets, defiled by this blood, so that no one dared to touch their garments.
25Lm 4:15 "Stay away! Unclean!" people shouted at them. "Away, away! Don't touch [us]!" So they wandered aimlessly. It was said among the nations, "They can stay here no longer."
25Lm 4:16 The LORD Himself has scattered them; He regards them no more. The priests are not respected; the elders find no favor.
25Lm 4:17 All the while our eyes were failing [as we looked] in vain for assistance; we watched from our towers for a nation that refused to help.
25Lm 4:18 Our steps were closely followed, so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end drew near; our time ran out. Our end had come!
25Lm 4:19 Those who chased us were swifter than eagles in the sky; they relentlessly pursued us over the mountains and ambushed us in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:20 The LORD's anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their traps; we had said about him: We will live under his protection among the nations.
25Lm 4:21 So rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you resident of the land of Uz! Yet the cup will pass to you as well; you will get drunk and expose yourself.
25Lm 4:22 Daughter Zion, your punishment is complete; He will not lengthen your exile. But He will punish your iniquity, Daughter Edom, and will expose your sins.
25Lm 5:1 Yahweh, remember what has happened to us. Look, and see our disgrace!
25Lm 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.
25Lm 5:3 We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are widows.
25Lm 5:4 We must pay for the water we drink; our wood comes at a price.
25Lm 5:5 We are closely pursued; we are tired, and no one offers us rest.
25Lm 5:6 We made a treaty with Egypt and with Assyria, to get enough food.
25Lm 5:7 Our fathers sinned; they no longer exist, but we bear their punishment.
25Lm 5:8 Slaves rule over us; no one rescues [us] from their hands.
25Lm 5:9 We secure our food at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.
25Lm 5:10 Our skin is as hot as an oven from the ravages of hunger.
25Lm 5:11 Women are raped in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.
25Lm 5:12 Princes are hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.
25Lm 5:13 Young men labor at millstones; boys stumble under [loads of] wood.
25Lm 5:14 The elders have left the city gate, the young men, their music.
25Lm 5:15 Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
25Lm 5:16 The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned.
25Lm 5:17 Because of this, our heart is sick; because of these, our eyes grow dim:
25Lm 5:18 because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate [and has] jackals prowling in it.
25Lm 5:19 You, LORD, are enthroned forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation.
25Lm 5:20 Why have You forgotten us forever, abandoned us for [our] entire lives?
25Lm 5:21 LORD, restore us to Yourself, so we may return; renew our days as in former times,
25Lm 5:22 unless You have completely rejected us and are intensely angry with us.

26Ezk 1:1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], on the fifth [day] of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.
26Ezk 1:2 On the fifth [day] of the month-- it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile--
26Ezk 1:3 the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar Canal. And the LORD's hand was on him there.
26Ezk 1:4 I looked and there was a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire, there was a gleam like amber.
26Ezk 1:5 The form of four living creatures came from it. And this was their appearance: They had human form,
26Ezk 1:6 but each of them had four faces and four wings.
26Ezk 1:7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, sparkling like the gleam of polished bronze.
26Ezk 1:8 [They had] human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings.
26Ezk 1:9 Their wings were touching. The creatures did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
26Ezk 1:10 The form of [each of] their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle.
26Ezk 1:11 [That is what] their faces [were like]. Their wings were spread upward; each had two [wings] touching that of another and two wings covering its body.
26Ezk 1:12 Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, they went without turning as they moved.
26Ezk 1:13 The form of the living creatures was like the appearance of burning coals of fire and torches. Fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, with lightning coming out of it.
26Ezk 1:14 The creatures were darting back and forth like flashes of lightning.
26Ezk 1:15 When I looked at the living creatures, there was one wheel on the ground beside each creature that had four faces.
26Ezk 1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their craftsmanship was like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same form. Their appearance and craftsmanship was like a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 1:17 When they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved.
26Ezk 1:18 Their rims were large and frightening. Each of their four rims were full of eyes all around.
26Ezk 1:19 So when the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels also rose.
26Ezk 1:20 Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, the creatures went in the direction the Spirit was moving. The wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:21 When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:22 The shape of an expanse, with a gleam like awe-inspiring crystal, was spread out over the heads of the living creatures.
26Ezk 1:23 And under the expanse their wings extended one toward another. Each of them also had two wings covering their bodies.
26Ezk 1:24 When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of mighty waters, like the voice of the Almighty, and a sound of commotion like the noise of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26Ezk 1:25 A voice came from above the expanse over their heads; when they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26Ezk 1:26 The shape of a throne with the appearance of sapphire stone was above the expanse. There was a form with the appearance of a human on the throne high above.
26Ezk 1:27 From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire enclosing it all around. From what seemed to be His waist down, I also saw what looked like fire. There was a brilliant light all around Him.
26Ezk 1:28 The appearance of the brilliant light all around was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the form of the LORD's glory. When I saw [it], I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking.
26Ezk 2:1 He said to me, "Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak with you."
26Ezk 2:2 As He spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I listened to the One who was speaking to me.
26Ezk 2:3 He said to me: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites [and] to the rebellious nations who have rebelled against Me. The Israelites and their ancestors have transgressed against Me to this day.
26Ezk 2:4 The children are obstinate and hardhearted. I am sending you to them, and you must say to them: This is what the Lord God says.
26Ezk 2:5 Whether they listen or refuse [to listen]-- for they are a rebellious house-- they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26Ezk 2:6 "But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words, though briers and thorns are beside you and you live among scorpions. Don't be afraid of their words or be discouraged by [the look on] their faces, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 2:7 But speak My words to them whether they listen or refuse [to listen], for they are rebellious.
26Ezk 2:8 "And you, son of man, listen to what I tell you: Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."
26Ezk 2:9 So I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and there was a written scroll in it.
26Ezk 2:10 When He unrolled it before me, it was written on the front and back; [words of] lamentation, mourning, and woe were written on it.
26Ezk 3:1 He said to me: "Son of man, eat what you find [here]. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.
26Ezk 3:3 "Son of man," he said to me, "eat and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you." So I ate [it], and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
26Ezk 3:4 Then He said to me: "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.
26Ezk 3:5 For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language but to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 3:6 [You are] not [being sent] to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.
26Ezk 3:7 But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to Me. For the whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hardhearted.
26Ezk 3:8 Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
26Ezk 3:9 I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don't be afraid of them or discouraged by [the look on] their faces, even though they are a rebellious house."
26Ezk 3:10 Next He said to me: "Son of man, listen carefully to all My words that I speak to you and take [them] to heart.
26Ezk 3:11 Go to your people, the exiles, and speak to them. Tell them: This is what the Lord God says, whether they listen or refuse [to listen]."
26Ezk 3:12 The Spirit then lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me-- praise the glory of the LORD in His place!--
26Ezk 3:13 with the sound of the living creatures' wings brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.
26Ezk 3:14 So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I left in bitterness and in an angry spirit, and the LORD's hand was on me powerfully.
26Ezk 3:15 I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there stunned for seven days.
26Ezk 3:16 Now at the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 3:17 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.
26Ezk 3:18 If I say to the wicked person: You will surely die, but you do not warn him-- you don't speak out to warn him about his wicked way in order to save his life-- that wicked person will die for his iniquity. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.
26Ezk 3:19 But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.
26Ezk 3:20 Now if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, and I put a stumbling block in front of him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die because of his sin and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.
26Ezk 3:21 But if you warn the righteous person that he should not sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he listened to [your] warning, and you will have saved your life."
26Ezk 3:22 Then the hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, "Get up, go out to the plain, and I will speak with you there."
26Ezk 3:23 So I got up and went out to the plain. The LORD's glory was present there, like the glory I had seen by the Chebar Canal, and I fell facedown.
26Ezk 3:24 The Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.
26Ezk 3:25 And you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so you cannot go out among them.
26Ezk 3:26 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be mute and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 3:27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them: This is what the Lord God says. Let the one who listens, listen, and let the one who refuses, refuse-- for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 4:1 "Now you, son of man, take a brick, set it in front of you, and draw the city of Jerusalem on it.
26Ezk 4:2 Then lay siege against it: construct a siege wall, build a ramp, pitch military camps, and place battering rams against it on all sides.
26Ezk 4:3 Take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Turn your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:4 "Then lie down on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. You will bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side.
26Ezk 4:5 For I have assigned you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days [you lie down], 390 days; so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:6 When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year.
26Ezk 4:7 You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
26Ezk 4:8 Be aware that I will put cords on you so you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days of your siege.
26Ezk 4:9 "Also take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the number of days you lie on your side, 390 days.
26Ezk 4:10 The food you eat each day will be eight ounces by weight; you will eat it from time to time.
26Ezk 4:11 You are also to drink water by measure, one-sixth of a gallon, [which] you will drink from time to time.
26Ezk 4:12 You will eat it as [you would] a barley cake and bake it over dried human excrement in their sight."
26Ezk 4:13 The LORD said, "This is how the Israelites will eat their bread-- ceremonially unclean-- among the nations where I will banish them."
26Ezk 4:14 But I said, "Ah, Lord God, I have never been defiled. From my youth until now I have not eaten anything that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts. And impure meat has never entered my mouth."
26Ezk 4:15 He replied to me, "Look, I will let you [use] cow dung instead of human excrement, and you can make your bread over that."
26Ezk 4:16 Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat bread [rationed] by weight and in dread drink water by measure.
26Ezk 4:17 So they will lack bread and water; everyone will be devastated and waste away because of their iniquity.
26Ezk 5:1 "Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as you would a barber's razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a pair of scales and divide the hair.
26Ezk 5:2 You are to burn up one third [of it] in the city when the days of the siege have ended; you are to take one third and slash [it] with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter one third to the wind, for I will draw a sword [to chase] after them.
26Ezk 5:3 But you are to take a few strands from the hair and secure them in the folds of your [robe].
26Ezk 5:4 Take some more of them, throw them into the fire, and burn them in it. A fire will spread from it to the whole house of Israel.
26Ezk 5:5 "This is what the Lord God says: I have set this Jerusalem in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
26Ezk 5:6 But she has rebelled against My ordinances with more wickedness than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that surround her. For her people have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.
26Ezk 5:7 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because you have been more insubordinate than the nations around you-- you have not walked in My statutes or kept My ordinances; you have not even kept the ordinances of the nations around you--
26Ezk 5:8 therefore, this is what the Lord God says: See, I am against you, [Jerusalem], and I will execute judgments within you in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 5:9 Because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never done before and what I will never do again.
26Ezk 5:10 As a result, fathers will eat [their] sons within Jerusalem, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments against you and scatter all your survivors to every direction of the wind.
26Ezk 5:11 "Therefore, as I live"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "I am going to cut [you] off and show [you] no pity, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable practices and abominations. Yes, I will not spare [you].
26Ezk 5:12 One third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine within you; one third will fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter one third to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword [to chase] after them.
26Ezk 5:13 When My anger is spent and I have vented My wrath on them, I will be appeased. Then, after I have spent My wrath on them, they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My jealousy.
26Ezk 5:14 "I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of everyone who passes by.
26Ezk 5:15 So you will be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations around you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and furious rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 5:16 When I shoot deadly arrows of famine at them, arrows for destruction that I will send to destroy you, [inhabitants of Jerusalem], I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply of bread.
26Ezk 5:17 I will send famine and dangerous animals against you. They will leave you childless, [Jerusalem]. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken."
26Ezk 6:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 6:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 6:3 You are to say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! This is what the Lord God says to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
26Ezk 6:4 Your altars will be desolated and your incense altars smashed. I will throw down your slain in front of your idols.
26Ezk 6:5 I will lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols and scatter your bones around your altars.
26Ezk 6:6 Wherever you live the cities will be in ruins and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars will lie in ruins and be desecrated, your idols smashed and obliterated, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
26Ezk 6:7 The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 6:8 "Yet I will leave a remnant when you are scattered among the nations, for throughout the countries there will be some of you who will escape the sword.
26Ezk 6:9 Then your survivors will remember Me among the nations where they are taken captive, how I was crushed by their promiscuous hearts that turned away from Me and by their eyes that lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves because of the evil things they did, their abominations of every kind.
26Ezk 6:10 And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten to bring this disaster on them without a reason.
26Ezk 6:11 "This is what the Lord God says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and cry out over all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, who will fall by the sword, famine, and plague.
26Ezk 6:12 The one who is far off will die by plague; the one who is near will fall by the sword; and the one who remains and is spared will die of famine. In this way I will exhaust My wrath on them.
26Ezk 6:13 You will [all] know that I am the LORD when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree and every leafy oak-- the places where they offered pleasing aromas to all their idols.
26Ezk 6:14 I will stretch out My hand against them, and wherever they live I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Diblah. Then they will know that I am Yahweh."
26Ezk 7:1 And the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 7:2 "Son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land.
26Ezk 7:3 The end is now on you; I will send My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:4 I will not look on you with pity or spare [you], but I will punish you for your ways and for your abominations within you. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 7:5 This is what the Lord God says: Look, one disaster after another is coming!
26Ezk 7:6 An end has come; the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming!
26Ezk 7:7 Doom has come on you, inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day is near. There will be panic on the mountains and not celebration.
26Ezk 7:8 I will pour out My wrath on you very soon; I will exhaust My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your abominations.
26Ezk 7:9 I will not look on [you] with pity or spare [you]. I will punish you for your ways and for your abominations within you. Then you will know that it is I, the LORD, who strikes.
26Ezk 7:10 Look, the day is coming! Doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed; arrogance has bloomed.
26Ezk 7:11 Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness; none of them [will remain]: none of their multitude, none of their wealth, and none of the eminent among them.
26Ezk 7:12 The time has come; the day has arrived. Let the buyer not rejoice and the seller not mourn, for wrath is on all her multitude.
26Ezk 7:13 The seller will certainly not return to what was sold as long as he and the buyer remain alive. For the vision concerning all its people will not be revoked, and none of them will preserve his life because of his iniquity.
26Ezk 7:14 They have blown the trumpet and prepared everything, but no one goes to war, for My wrath is on all her multitude.
26Ezk 7:15 The sword is on the outside; plague and famine are on the inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and plague will devour whoever is in the city.
26Ezk 7:16 The survivors among them will escape and live on the mountains like doves of the valley, all of them moaning, each over his own iniquity.
26Ezk 7:17 All their hands will become weak, and all [their] knees will turn to water.
26Ezk 7:18 They will put on sackcloth, and horror will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all [their] faces, and all their heads will be bald.
26Ezk 7:19 They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will seem like something filthy. Their silver and gold will be unable to save them in the day of the LORD's wrath. They will not satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs, for these were the stumbling blocks that brought about their iniquity.
26Ezk 7:20 He appointed His beautiful ornaments for majesty, but they made their abhorrent images from them, their detestable things. Therefore, I have made these into something filthy for them.
26Ezk 7:21 I will hand these things over to foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane them.
26Ezk 7:22 I will turn My face from the wicked as they profane My treasured place. Violent men will enter it and profane it.
26Ezk 7:23 Forge the chain, for the land is filled with crimes of bloodshed, and the city is filled with violence.
26Ezk 7:24 So I will bring the most evil of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their sacred places will be profaned.
26Ezk 7:25 Anguish is coming! They will seek peace, but there will be none.
26Ezk 7:26 Disaster after disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priests and counsel from the elders.
26Ezk 7:27 The king will mourn; the prince will be clothed in grief; and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their own conduct, and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 8:1 In the sixth year, in the sixth [month], on the fifth [day] of the month, I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting in front of me, and there the hand of the Lord God came down on me.
26Ezk 8:2 I looked, and there was a form that had the appearance of a man. From what seemed to be His waist down was fire, and from His waist up was something that looked bright, like the gleam of amber.
26Ezk 8:3 He stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where the offensive statue that provokes jealousy was located.
26Ezk 8:4 I saw the glory of the God of Israel there, like the vision I had seen in the plain.
26Ezk 8:5 The LORD said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." I looked to the north, and there was this offensive statue north of the altar gate, at the entrance.
26Ezk 8:6 He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, so that I must depart from My sanctuary? You will see even greater abominations."
26Ezk 8:7 Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked there was a hole in the wall.
26Ezk 8:8 He said to me, "Son of man, dig through the wall." So I dug through the wall, and there was a doorway.
26Ezk 8:9 He said to me, "Go in and see the terrible abominations they are committing here."
26Ezk 8:10 I went in and looked, and there engraved all around the wall was every form of detestable thing, crawling creatures and beasts, as well as all the idols of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 8:11 Seventy elders from the house of Israel were standing before them, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had an incense burner in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising up.
26Ezk 8:12 Then He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his idol? For they are saying: The LORD does not see us. The LORD has abandoned the land."
26Ezk 8:13 Again He said to me, "You will see even greater abominations, which they are committing."
26Ezk 8:14 So He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the LORD's house, and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
26Ezk 8:15 And He said to me, "Do you see [this], son of man? You will see even greater abominations than these."
26Ezk 8:16 So He brought me to the inner court of the LORD's house, and there were about 25 men at the entrance of the LORD's temple, between the portico and the altar, with their backs to the LORD's temple and their faces [turned] to the east. They were bowing to the east in worship of the sun.
26Ezk 8:17 And He said to me, "Do you see [this], son of man? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the abominations they are practicing here, that they must also fill the land with violence and repeatedly provoke Me to anger, even putting the branch to their nose?
26Ezk 8:18 Therefore I will respond with wrath. I will not show pity or spare [them]. Though they cry out in My ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them."
26Ezk 9:1 Then He called to me directly with a loud voice, "Come near, executioners of the city, each [of you] with a destructive weapon in his hand."
26Ezk 9:2 And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a war club in his hand. There was another man among them, clothed in linen, with writing equipment at his side. They came and stood beside the bronze altar.
26Ezk 9:3 Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man clothed in linen with the writing equipment at his side.
26Ezk 9:4 "Pass throughout the city of Jerusalem," the LORD said to him, "and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations committed in it."
26Ezk 9:5 To the others He said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him and start killing; do not show pity or spare [them]!
26Ezk 9:6 Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, as well as the [older] women and little children, but do not come near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at My sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.
26Ezk 9:7 Then He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!" So they went out killing [people] in the city.
26Ezk 9:8 While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, "Ah, Lord God! Are You going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem?"
26Ezk 9:9 He answered me: "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity. For they say: The LORD has abandoned the land; He does not see.
26Ezk 9:10 But as for Me, I will not show pity or spare [them]. I will bring their actions down on their own heads."
26Ezk 9:11 Then the man clothed in linen with the writing equipment at his side reported back, "I have done as You commanded me."
26Ezk 10:1 Then I looked, and there above the expanse over the heads of the cherubim was something like sapphire stone resembling the shape of a throne that appeared above them.
26Ezk 10:2 The LORD spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, "Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with hot coals from among the cherubim and scatter [them] over the city." So he went in as I watched.
26Ezk 10:3 Now the cherubim were standing to the south of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
26Ezk 10:4 Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the LORD's glory.
26Ezk 10:5 The sound of the cherubim's wings could be heard as far as the outer court; it was like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
26Ezk 10:6 After the LORD commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, "Take fire from inside the wheelwork, from among the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
26Ezk 10:7 Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took [some], and put [it] into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
26Ezk 10:8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.
26Ezk 10:9 I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. The luster of the wheels was like the gleam of beryl.
26Ezk 10:10 In appearance, all four had the same form, like a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 10:11 When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved. But wherever the head faced, they would go in that direction, without pivoting as they went.
26Ezk 10:12 Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, wings, and the wheels that the four of them had, were full of eyes all around.
26Ezk 10:13 As I listened the wheels were called "the wheelwork."
26Ezk 10:14 Each one had four faces: the first face was that of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle.
26Ezk 10:15 The cherubim ascended; these were the living creatures I had seen by the Chebar Canal.
26Ezk 10:16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when they lifted their wings to rise from the earth, even then the wheels did not veer away from them.
26Ezk 10:17 When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they ascended, the wheels ascended with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
26Ezk 10:18 Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim.
26Ezk 10:19 The cherubim lifted their wings and ascended from the earth right before my eyes; the wheels were beside them as they went. The glory of the God of Israel was above them, and it stood at the entrance to the eastern gate of the LORD's house.
26Ezk 10:20 These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Chebar Canal, and I recognized that they were cherubim.
26Ezk 10:21 Each had four faces and each had four wings, with the form of human hands under their wings.
26Ezk 10:22 Their faces looked like the same faces I had seen by the Chebar Canal. Each creature went straight ahead.
26Ezk 11:1 The Spirit then lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the LORD's house, which faces east, and at the gate's entrance were 25 men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
26Ezk 11:2 The LORD said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who plan evil and give wicked advice in this city.
26Ezk 11:3 They are saying: Isn't the time near to build houses? The city is the pot, and we are the meat.
26Ezk 11:4 Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!"
26Ezk 11:5 Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and He told me, "You are to say: This is what the LORD says: That is what you are thinking, house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your mind.
26Ezk 11:6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with the dead.
26Ezk 11:7 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: The slain you have put within it are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will remove you from it.
26Ezk 11:8 You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 11:9 "I will bring you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute judgments against you.
26Ezk 11:10 You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 11:11 The city will not be a pot for you, and you will not be the meat within it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
26Ezk 11:12 so you will know that I am the LORD, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not practiced. Instead, you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you."
26Ezk 11:13 Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out with a loud voice: "Ah, Lord God! Will You bring to an end the remnant of Israel?"
26Ezk 11:14 The word of the LORD came to me again:
26Ezk 11:15 "Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem you,and the entire house of Israel, all of them, are those the residents of Jerusalem have said this to: Stay away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.
26Ezk 11:16 "Therefore say: This is what the Lord God says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.
26Ezk 11:17 "Therefore say: This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
26Ezk 11:18 "When they arrive there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it.
26Ezk 11:19 And I will give them one heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,
26Ezk 11:20 so they may follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God.
26Ezk 11:21 But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for detestable things and abominations, I will bring their actions down on their own heads." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 11:22 Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
26Ezk 11:23 The glory of the LORD rose up from within the city and stood on the mountain east of the city.
26Ezk 11:24 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea and to the exiles in a vision from the Spirit of God. After the vision I had seen left me,
26Ezk 11:25 I spoke to the exiles about all the things the LORD had shown me.
26Ezk 12:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:2 "Son of man, you are living among a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:3 "Son of man, pack your bags for exile and go into exile in their sight during the day. You will go into exile from your place to another place while they watch; perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:4 During the day, bring out your bags like an exile's bags while they look on. Then in the evening go out in their sight like those going into exile.
26Ezk 12:5 As they watch, dig through the wall and take the [bags] out through it.
26Ezk 12:6 And while they look on, lift [the bags] to [your] shoulder and take [them] out in the dark; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 12:7 So I did just as I was commanded. I brought out my bags like an exile's bags in the daytime. In the evening I dug through the wall by hand; I took [them] out in the dark, carrying [them] on my shoulder in their sight.
26Ezk 12:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me in the morning:
26Ezk 12:9 "Son of man, hasn't the house of Israel, that rebellious house, asked you: What are you doing?
26Ezk 12:10 Say to them: This is what the Lord God says: This oracle is about the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are living there.
26Ezk 12:11 You are to say: I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.
26Ezk 12:12 The prince who is among them will lift [his bags] to his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig through the wall to bring [him] out through it. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land with his eyes.
26Ezk 12:13 But I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it, and he will die there.
26Ezk 12:14 I will also scatter all the attendants who surround him and all his troops to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword [to chase] after them.
26Ezk 12:15 They will know that I am the LORD when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
26Ezk 12:16 But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague so they can tell about all their abominations among the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 12:17 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:18 "Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with shaking and anxiety.
26Ezk 12:19 Then say to the people of the land: This is what the Lord God says about the residents of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in dread, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there.
26Ezk 12:20 The inhabited cities will be destroyed, and the land will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 12:21 Again the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:22 "Son of man, what is this proverb you [people] have about the land of Israel, which goes: The days keep passing by, and every vision fails?
26Ezk 12:23 Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord God says: I will put a stop to this proverb, and they will not use it again in Israel. But say to them: The days draw near, as well as the fulfillment of every vision.
26Ezk 12:24 For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
26Ezk 12:25 But I, the LORD, will speak whatever message I will speak, and it will be done. It will no longer be delayed. For in your days, rebellious house, I will speak a message and bring it to pass." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 12:26 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 12:27 "Son of man, notice that the house of Israel is saying: The vision that he sees concerns many years [from now]; he prophesies about distant times.
26Ezk 12:28 Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord God says: None of My words will be delayed any longer. The message I speak will be fulfilled." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 13:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 13:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: Hear the word of the LORD!
26Ezk 13:3 This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing.
26Ezk 13:4 Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins.
26Ezk 13:5 You did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall around the house of Israel so that it might stand in battle on the day of the LORD.
26Ezk 13:6 They see false visions and speak lying divinations. They claim: [This is] the LORD's declaration, when the LORD did not send them, yet they wait for the fulfillment of [their] message.
26Ezk 13:7 Didn't you see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you proclaimed: [This is] the LORD's declaration, even though I had not spoken?
26Ezk 13:8 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am against you because you have spoken falsely and had lying visions." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 13:9 "My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not be present in the fellowship of My people or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, and they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.
26Ezk 13:10 "Since they have led My people astray saying: Peace, when there is no peace, for when someone builds a wall they plaster it with whitewash,
26Ezk 13:11 therefore, tell those who plaster [it] that it will fall. Torrential rain will come, and I will send hailstones plunging down, and a windstorm will be released.
26Ezk 13:12 Now when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked: Where is the coat of whitewash that you put on [it]?
26Ezk 13:13 "So this is what the Lord God says: I will release a windstorm in My wrath. Torrential rain will come in My anger, and hailstones [will fall] in destructive fury.
26Ezk 13:14 I will tear down the wall you plastered with whitewash and knock it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and you will be destroyed within it. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:15 After I exhaust My wrath against the wall and against those who plaster it with whitewash, I will say to you: The wall is no more and neither are those who plastered it--
26Ezk 13:16 those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 13:17 "Now, son of man, turn toward the women of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them
26Ezk 13:18 and say: This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the women who sew [magic] bands on the wrist of every hand and who make veils for the heads of people of every height in order to ensnare lives. Will you ensnare the lives of My people but preserve your own?
26Ezk 13:19 You profane Me in front of My people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread; you kill those who should not die and spare those who should not live, when you lie to My people, who listen to lies.
26Ezk 13:20 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I am against your [magic] bands that you ensnare people with like birds, and I will tear them from your arms. I will free the people you have ensnared like birds.
26Ezk 13:21 I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, so that they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 13:22 Because you have disheartened the righteous person with lies, even though I have not caused him grief, and because you have encouraged the wicked person not to turn from his evil way to save his life,
26Ezk 13:23 therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will deliver My people from your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 14:1 Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
26Ezk 14:2 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:3 "Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and have put sinful stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I be consulted by them at all?
26Ezk 14:4 "Therefore, speak to them and tell them: This is what the Lord God says: When anyone from the house of Israel sets up idols in his heart, puts a sinful stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet, I, the LORD, will answer him appropriately. [I will answer him] according to his many idols,
26Ezk 14:5 so that I may take hold of the house of Israel by their hearts, because they are all estranged from Me by their idols.
26Ezk 14:6 "Therefore, say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: Repent and turn away from your idols; turn your faces away from all your abominations.
26Ezk 14:7 For when anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who reside in Israel separates himself from Me, setting up idols in his heart and putting a sinful stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me, I, the LORD, will answer him Myself.
26Ezk 14:8 I will turn against that one and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among My people. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 14:9 "But if the prophet is deceived and speaks a message, it was I, the LORD, who deceived that prophet. I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
26Ezk 14:10 They will bear their punishment-- the punishment of the one who inquires will be the same as that of the prophet--
26Ezk 14:11 in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from following Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Then they will be My people and I will be their God." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 14:12 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 14:13 "Son of man, if a land sins against Me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out My hand against it to cut off its supply of bread, to send famine through it, and to wipe out [both] man and animal from it,
26Ezk 14:14 even [if] these three men-- Noah, Daniel, and Job-- were in it, they would deliver [only] themselves by their righteousness." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 14:15 "If I allow dangerous animals to pass through the land and depopulate it so that it becomes desolate, with no one passing through [it] for [fear of] the animals,
26Ezk 14:16 even [if] these three men were in it, as I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "they could not deliver [their] sons or daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate.
26Ezk 14:17 "Or if I bring a sword against that land and say: Let a sword pass through it, so that I wipe out [both] man and animal from it,
26Ezk 14:18 even [if] these three men were in it, as I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "they could not deliver [their] sons or daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
26Ezk 14:19 "Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out My wrath on it with bloodshed to wipe out [both] man and animal from it,
26Ezk 14:20 even [if] Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "they could not deliver [their] son or daughter. They would deliver [only] themselves by their righteousness.
26Ezk 14:21 "For this is what the Lord God says: How much worse will it be when I send My four devastating judgments against Jerusalem-- sword, famine, dangerous animals, and plague-- in order to wipe out [both] man and animal from it!
26Ezk 14:22 Even so, there will be survivors left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. Indeed, they will come out to you, and you will observe their conduct and actions. Then you will be consoled about the devastation I have brought on Jerusalem, about all I have brought on it.
26Ezk 14:23 They will bring you consolation when you see their conduct and actions, and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done what I did to it." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 15:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 15:2 "Son of man, how does the wood of the vine, that branch among the trees of the forest, compare to any other wood?
26Ezk 15:3 Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?
26Ezk 15:4 In fact, it is put into the fire as fuel. The fire devours both of its ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything?
26Ezk 15:5 Even when it was whole it could not be made into a useful object. How much less can it ever be made into anything useful when the fire has devoured it and it is charred!
26Ezk 15:6 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire as fuel, so I will give up the residents of Jerusalem.
26Ezk 15:7 I will turn against them. They may have escaped from the fire, but it will [still] consume them. And you will know that I am the LORD when I turn against them.
26Ezk 15:8 I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:1 The word of the LORD came to me again:
26Ezk 16:2 "Son of man, explain Jerusalem's abominations to her.
26Ezk 16:3 You are to say: This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
26Ezk 16:4 As for your birth, your umbilical cord wasn't cut on the day you were born, and you weren't washed clean with water. You were not rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
26Ezk 16:5 No one cared [enough] about you to do even one of these things out of compassion for you. But you were thrown out into the open field because you were despised on the day you were born.
26Ezk 16:6 "I passed by you and saw you lying in your blood, and I said to you [as you lay] in your blood: Live! Yes, I said to you [as you lay] in your blood: Live!
26Ezk 16:7 I made you thrive like plants of the field. You grew up and matured and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, but you were stark naked.
26Ezk 16:8 "Then I passed by you and saw you, and you were indeed at the age for love. So I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. I pledged Myself to you, entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:9 "I washed you with water, rinsed off your blood, and anointed you with oil.
26Ezk 16:10 I clothed you in embroidered cloth and provided you with leather sandals. I also wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
26Ezk 16:11 I adorned you with jewelry, putting bracelets on your wrists and a chain around your neck.
26Ezk 16:12 I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful tiara on your head.
26Ezk 16:13 So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was [made] of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained royalty.
26Ezk 16:14 Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor, which I had bestowed on you." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:15 "But you were confident in your beauty and acted like a prostitute because of your fame. You lavished your sexual favors on everyone who passed by. Your beauty became his.
26Ezk 16:16 You took some of your garments and made colorful high places for yourself, and you engaged in prostitution on them. These places should not have been built, and this should never have happened!
26Ezk 16:17 You also took your beautiful jewelry made from the gold and silver I had given you, and you made male images so that you could engage in prostitution with them.
26Ezk 16:18 Then you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set My oil and incense before them.
26Ezk 16:19 You also set before them as a pleasing aroma the food I gave you-- the fine flour, oil, and honey that I fed you. That is what happened." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:20 "You even took your sons and daughters you bore to Me and sacrificed them to these images as food. Wasn't your prostitution enough?
26Ezk 16:21 You slaughtered My children and gave them up when you passed them through [the fire] to the images.
26Ezk 16:22 In all your abominations and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth when you were stark naked and lying in your blood.
26Ezk 16:23 "Then after all your evil-- Woe, woe to you!"-- the declaration of the Lord God--
26Ezk 16:24 "you built yourself a mound and made yourself an elevated place in every square.
26Ezk 16:25 You built your elevated place at the head of every street and turned your beauty into an abomination. You spread your legs to everyone who passed by and increased your prostitution.
26Ezk 16:26 You engaged in promiscuous acts with Egyptian men, your well-endowed neighbors, and increased your prostitution to provoke Me to anger.
26Ezk 16:27 "Therefore, I stretched out My hand against you and reduced your provisions. I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the Philistine women, who were embarrassed by your indecent behavior.
26Ezk 16:28 Then you engaged in prostitution with the Assyrian men because you were not satisfied. Even though you did this with them, you were still not satisfied.
26Ezk 16:29 So you extended your prostitution to Chaldea, the land of merchants, but you were not even satisfied with this!
26Ezk 16:30 "How your heart was inflamed [with lust]"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "when you did all these things, the acts of a brazen prostitute,
26Ezk 16:31 building your mound at the head of every street and making your elevated place in every square. But you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment.
26Ezk 16:32 You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
26Ezk 16:33 Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave gifts to all your lovers. You bribed them to come to you from all around for your sexual favors.
26Ezk 16:34 So you were the opposite of other women in your acts of prostitution; no one solicited you. When you paid a fee instead of one being paid to you, you were the opposite.
26Ezk 16:35 "Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD!
26Ezk 16:36 This is what the Lord God says: Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness exposed by your acts of prostitution with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols and the blood of your children that you gave to them,
26Ezk 16:37 I am therefore going to gather all the lovers you pleased-- all those you loved as well as all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and expose your nakedness to them so they see you completely naked.
26Ezk 16:38 I will judge you the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged. Then I will bring about your bloodshed in wrath and jealousy.
26Ezk 16:39 I will hand you over to them, and they will level your mounds and tear down your elevated places. They will strip off your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you stark naked.
26Ezk 16:40 They will bring a mob against you to stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
26Ezk 16:41 Then they will burn down your houses and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women. I will stop you from being a prostitute, and you will never again pay fees for lovers.
26Ezk 16:42 So I will satisfy My wrath against you, and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be silent and no longer angry.
26Ezk 16:43 Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged Me with all these things, I will also bring your actions down on your own head." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "Haven't you committed immoral acts in addition to all your abominations?
26Ezk 16:44 "Look, everyone who uses proverbs will say this proverb about you: Like mother, like daughter.
26Ezk 16:45 You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26Ezk 16:46 Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you, and your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters to the south of you.
26Ezk 16:47 Didn't you walk in their ways and practice their abominations? It was only a short time before you behaved more corruptly than they did.
26Ezk 16:48 "As I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "your sister Sodom and her daughters have not behaved as you and your daughters have.
26Ezk 16:49 Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, plenty of food, and comfortable security, but didn't support the poor and needy.
26Ezk 16:50 They were haughty and did detestable things before Me, so I removed them when I saw [this].
26Ezk 16:51 But Samaria did not commit [even] half your sins. You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs and made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations you have committed.
26Ezk 16:52 You must also bear your disgrace, since you have been an advocate for your sisters. For they appear more righteous than you because of your sins, which you committed more abhorrently than they [did]. So you also, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, since you have made your sisters appear righteous.
26Ezk 16:53 "I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and those of Samaria and her daughters. I will also restore your fortunes among them,
26Ezk 16:54 so you will bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you did when you comforted them.
26Ezk 16:55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state. You and your daughters will also return to your former state.
26Ezk 16:56 Didn't you treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn when you were proud,
26Ezk 16:57 before your wickedness was exposed? It was like the time you were scorned by the daughters of Aram and all those around her, and by the daughters of the Philistines-- those who treated you with contempt from every side.
26Ezk 16:58 You yourself must bear the consequences of your indecency and abominations"-- the LORD's declaration.
26Ezk 16:59 "For this is what the Lord God says: I will deal with you according to what you have done, since you have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
26Ezk 16:60 But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
26Ezk 16:61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.
26Ezk 16:62 I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD,
26Ezk 16:63 so that when I make atonement for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 17:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:2 "Son of man, pose a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 17:3 You are to say: This is what the Lord God says: A great eagle with great wings, long pinions, and full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
26Ezk 17:4 He plucked off its topmost shoot, brought it to the land of merchants, and set it in a city of traders.
26Ezk 17:5 Then he took some of the land's seed and put it in a fertile field; he set it [like] a willow, a plant by abundant waters.
26Ezk 17:6 It sprouted and became a spreading vine, low in height with its branches turned toward him, yet its roots stayed under it. So it became a vine, produced branches, and sent forth shoots.
26Ezk 17:7 But there was another great eagle with great wings and thick plumage. And this vine bent its roots toward him! It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed, so that he might water it.
26Ezk 17:8 It had been planted in a good field by abundant waters in order to produce branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.
26Ezk 17:9 You are to say: This is what the Lord God says: Will it flourish? Will he not tear out its roots and strip off its fruit so that it shrivels? All its fresh leaves will wither! Great strength and many people will not be needed to pull it from its roots.
26Ezk 17:10 Even though it is planted, will it flourish? Won't it completely wither when the east wind strikes it? It will wither on the bed where it sprouted."
26Ezk 17:11 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 17:12 "Now say to that rebellious house: Don't you know what these things mean? Tell [them]: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon.
26Ezk 17:13 He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. Then he took away the leading men of the land,
26Ezk 17:14 so the kingdom might be humble and not exalt itself but might keep his covenant in order to endure.
26Ezk 17:15 However, this king revolted against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt so they might give him horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and [still] escape?
26Ezk 17:16 "As I live"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.
26Ezk 17:17 Pharaoh will not help him with [his] great army and vast horde in battle, when ramps are built and siege walls constructed to destroy many lives.
26Ezk 17:18 He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. He did all these things even though he gave his hand [in pledge]. He will not escape!"
26Ezk 17:19 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "As I live, I will bring down on his head My oath that he despised and My covenant that he broke.
26Ezk 17:20 I will spread My net over him, and he will be captured in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for the treachery he committed against Me.
26Ezk 17:21 All the fugitives among his troops will fall by the sword, and those who survive will be scattered to every direction of the wind. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken."
26Ezk 17:22 This is what the Lord God says: I will take [a sprig] from the lofty top of the cedar and plant [it]. I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots, and I will plant [it] on a high towering mountain.
26Ezk 17:23 I will plant it on Israel's high mountain so that it may bear branches, produce fruit, and become a majestic cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it, taking shelter in the shade of its branches.
26Ezk 17:24 Then all the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD. I bring down the tall tree, and make the low tree tall. I cause the green tree to wither and make the withered tree thrive. I, Yahweh, have spoken and I will do [it].
26Ezk 18:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 18:2 "What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel: The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
26Ezk 18:3 As I live"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "you will no longer use this proverb in Israel.
26Ezk 18:4 Look, every life belongs to Me. The life of the father is like the life of the son-- both belong to Me. The person who sins is the one who will die.
26Ezk 18:5 "Now suppose a man is righteous and does what is just and right:
26Ezk 18:6 He does not eat at the mountain [shrines] or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife or come near a woman during her menstrual impurity.
26Ezk 18:7 He doesn't oppress anyone but returns his collateral to the debtor. He does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing.
26Ezk 18:8 He doesn't lend at interest or for profit but keeps his hand from wrongdoing and carries out true justice between men.
26Ezk 18:9 He follows My statutes and keeps My ordinances, acting faithfully. Such a person is righteous; he will certainly live." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 18:10 "Now suppose the man has a violent son, who sheds blood and does any of these [things],
26Ezk 18:11 though the father has done none of them. Indeed, when the son eats at the mountain [shrines] and defiles his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:12 and [when] he oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, and does not return collateral, and [when] he raises his eyes to the idols, commits abominations,
26Ezk 18:13 and lends at interest or for profit, will he live? He will not live! Since he has committed all these abominations, he will certainly die. His blood will be on him.
26Ezk 18:14 "Now suppose he has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, and though he sees them, he does not do likewise.
26Ezk 18:15 He does not eat at the mountain [shrines] or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife.
26Ezk 18:16 He doesn't oppress anyone, hold collateral, or commit robbery. He gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing.
26Ezk 18:17 He keeps his hand from [harming] the poor, not taking interest or profit [on a loan]. He practices My ordinances and follows My statutes. Such a person will not die for his father's iniquity. He will certainly live.
26Ezk 18:18 "As for his father, he will die for his own iniquity because he practiced fraud, robbed [his] brother, and did what was wrong among his people.
26Ezk 18:19 But you may ask: Why doesn't the son suffer punishment for the father's iniquity? Since the son has done what is just and right, carefully observing all My statues, he will certainly live.
26Ezk 18:20 The person who sins is the one who will die. A son won't suffer punishment for the father's iniquity, and a father won't suffer punishment for the son's iniquity. The righteousness of the righteous person will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked person will be on him.
26Ezk 18:21 "Now if the wicked person turns from all the sins he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is just and right, he will certainly live; he will not die.
26Ezk 18:22 None of the transgressions he has committed will be held against him. He will live because of the righteousness he has practiced.
26Ezk 18:23 Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?" [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "Instead, don't I [take pleasure] when he turns from his ways and lives?
26Ezk 18:24 But when a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, committing the same abominations that the wicked do, will he live? None of the righteous acts he did will be remembered. He will die because of the treachery he has engaged in and the sin he has committed.
26Ezk 18:25 "But you say: The Lord's way isn't fair. Now listen, house of Israel: Is it My way that is unfair? Instead, isn't it your ways that are unfair?
26Ezk 18:26 When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, he will die for this. He will die because of the iniquity he has practiced.
26Ezk 18:27 But if a wicked person turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will preserve his life.
26Ezk 18:28 He will certainly live because he thought it over and turned from all the transgressions he had committed; he will not die.
26Ezk 18:29 But the house of Israel says: The Lord's way isn't fair. Is it My ways that are unfair, house of Israel? Instead, isn't it your ways that are unfair?
26Ezk 18:30 "Therefore, house of Israel, I will judge each one of you according to his ways." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so they will not be a stumbling block that causes your punishment.
26Ezk 18:31 Throw off all the transgressions you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, house of Israel?
26Ezk 18:32 For I take no pleasure in anyone's death." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "So repent and live!
26Ezk 19:1 "Now, lament for the princes of Israel
26Ezk 19:2 and say: What was your mother? A lioness! She lay down among the lions; she reared her cubs among the young lions.
26Ezk 19:3 She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people.
26Ezk 19:4 When the nations heard about him, he was caught in their pit. Then they led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 19:5 When she saw that she waited [in vain], that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
26Ezk 19:6 He prowled among the lions, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people.
26Ezk 19:7 He devastated their strongholds and destroyed their cities. The land and everything in it shuddered at the sound of his roaring.
26Ezk 19:8 Then the nations from the surrounding provinces set out against him. They spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
26Ezk 19:9 They put a wooden yoke on him with hooks and led him away to the king of Babylon. They brought him into the fortresses so his roar could no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 19:10 Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of plentiful waters.
26Ezk 19:11 It had strong branches, [fit] for the scepters of rulers; its height towered among the clouds. So it was conspicuous for its height as well as its many branches.
26Ezk 19:12 But it was uprooted in fury, thrown to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were torn off and dried up; fire consumed them.
26Ezk 19:13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
26Ezk 19:14 Fire has gone out from its main branch and has devoured its fruit, so that it no longer has a strong branch, a scepter for ruling. This is a lament and should be used as a lament."
26Ezk 20:1 In the seventh year, in the fifth [month], on the tenth [day] of the month, some of Israel's elders came to consult the LORD, and they sat down in front of me.
26Ezk 20:2 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:3 "Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel and tell them: This is what the Lord God says: Are you coming to consult Me? As I live, I will not be consulted by you." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 20:4 "Will you pass judgment against them, will you pass judgment, son of man? Explain to them the abominations of their fathers.
26Ezk 20:5 Say to them: This is what the Lord God says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of Jacob's house and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt. I swore to them, saying: I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:6 On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, [a land] flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands.
26Ezk 20:7 I also said to them: Each of you must throw away the detestable things that are before your eyes and not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:8 "But they rebelled against Me and were unwilling to listen to Me. None of them threw away the detestable things that were before their eyes, and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them, exhausting My anger against them within the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:9 But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations they were living among, in whose sight I had made Myself known to Israel by bringing them out of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:10 "So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:11 Then I gave them My statutes and explained My ordinances to them-- the person who does them will live by them.
26Ezk 20:12 I also gave them My Sabbaths to serve as a sign between Me and them, so they will know that I am the LORD who sets them apart as holy.
26Ezk 20:13 "But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not follow My statutes and they rejected My ordinances-- the person who does them will live by them. They also completely profaned My Sabbaths. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them in the wilderness to put an end to them.
26Ezk 20:14 But I acted because of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:15 However, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given [them]-- the most beautiful of all lands, flowing with milk and honey--
26Ezk 20:16 because they rejected My ordinances, profaned My Sabbaths, and did not follow My statutes. For their hearts went after their idols.
26Ezk 20:17 But I spared them from destruction and did not bring them to an end in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:18 "Then I said to their children in the wilderness: Don't follow the statutes of your fathers, defile yourselves with their idols, or keep their ordinances.
26Ezk 20:19 I am the LORD your God. Follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them.
26Ezk 20:20 Keep My Sabbaths holy, and they will be a sign between Me and you, so you may know that I am the LORD your God.
26Ezk 20:21 "But the children rebelled against Me. They did not follow My statutes or carefully keep My ordinances-- the person who does them will live by them. They also profaned My Sabbaths. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them and exhausting My anger against them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:22 But I withheld My hand and acted because of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I brought them out.
26Ezk 20:23 However, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
26Ezk 20:24 For they did not practice My ordinances but rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers' idols.
26Ezk 20:25 I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances that did not bring them life.
26Ezk 20:26 When they made every firstborn pass through [the fire], I defiled them through their gifts in order to devastate them so they would know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:27 "Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them: This is what the Lord God says: In this way also your fathers blasphemed Me by committing treachery against Me:
26Ezk 20:28 When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and they saw any high hill or leafy tree, they offered their sacrifices and presented their offensive offerings there. They also sent up their pleasing aromas and poured out their drink offerings there.
26Ezk 20:29 So I asked them: What is this high place you are going to? And it is called High Place to this day.
26Ezk 20:30 "Therefore say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: Are you defiling yourselves the way your fathers did, and prostituting yourselves with their detestable things?
26Ezk 20:31 When you offer your gifts, making your children pass through the fire, you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. So should I be consulted by you, house of Israel? As I live"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "I will not be consulted by you!
26Ezk 20:32 "When you say: Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of [other] countries, worshiping wood and stone, what you have in mind will never happen.
26Ezk 20:33 As I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "I will rule over you with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath.
26Ezk 20:34 I will bring you from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you were scattered, with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath.
26Ezk 20:35 I will lead you into the wilderness of the peoples and enter into judgment with you there face to face.
26Ezk 20:36 Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 20:37 "I will make you pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
26Ezk 20:38 And I will also purge you of those who rebel and transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they live as foreign residents, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:39 "As for you, house of Israel, this is what the Lord God says: Go and serve your idols, each of you. But afterwards you will surely listen to Me, and you will no longer defile My holy name with your gifts and idols.
26Ezk 20:40 For on My holy mountain, Israel's high mountain"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "there the entire house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land. There I will accept them and will require your contributions and choicest gifts, all your holy offerings.
26Ezk 20:41 When I bring you from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, I will accept you as a pleasing aroma. And I will demonstrate My holiness through you in the sight of the nations.
26Ezk 20:42 When I lead you into the land of Israel, the land I swore to give your fathers, you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 20:43 There you will remember your ways and all your deeds you have defiled yourselves with, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil things you have done.
26Ezk 20:44 You will know that I am the LORD, house of Israel, when I have dealt with you because of My name rather than according to your evil ways and corrupt acts." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 20:45  The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 20:46 "Son of man, face the south and preach against it. Prophesy against the forest land in the Negev,
26Ezk 20:47 and say to the forest there: Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord God says: I am about to ignite a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree and every dry tree in you. The blazing flame will not be extinguished, and every face from the south to the north will be scorched by it.
26Ezk 20:48 Then all people will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it. It will not be extinguished."
26Ezk 20:49 Then I said, "Ah, Lord God, they are saying of me: Isn't he [just] posing riddles?"
26Ezk 21:1  The word of the LORD came to me again:
26Ezk 21:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel,
26Ezk 21:3 and say to it: This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you.
26Ezk 21:4 Since I will cut off [both] the righteous and the wicked, My sword will therefore come out of its sheath against everyone from the south to the north.
26Ezk 21:5 So all the people will know that I, the LORD, have taken My sword from its sheath-- it will not be sheathed again.
26Ezk 21:6 "But you, son of man, groan! Groan bitterly with a broken heart right before their eyes.
26Ezk 21:7 And when they ask you: Why are you groaning? then say: Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, and every hand will become weak. Every spirit will be discouraged, and every knee will turn to water. Yes, it is coming and it will happen." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 21:8 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:9 "Son of man, prophesy: This is what the Lord says! You are to proclaim: A sword! A sword is sharpened and also polished.
26Ezk 21:10 It is sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Should we rejoice? The scepter of My son, the sword despises every tree.
26Ezk 21:11 The sword is given to be polished, to be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened, and it is polished, to be put in the hand of the slayer.
26Ezk 21:12 Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against My people. It is against all the princes of Israel! They are given over to the sword with My people. Therefore strike [your] thigh [in grief].
26Ezk 21:13 Surely it will be a trial! And what if the sword despises even the scepter? The scepter will not continue. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 21:14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap [your] hands together. Let the sword strike two times, even three. It is a sword for massacre, a sword for great massacre-- it surrounds them!
26Ezk 21:15 I have appointed a sword for slaughter at all their gates, so that their hearts may melt and many may stumble. Alas! It is ready to flash like lightning; it is drawn for slaughter.
26Ezk 21:16 Slash to the right; turn to the left-- wherever your blade is directed.
26Ezk 21:17 I also will clap My hands together, and I will satisfy My wrath. I, the LORD, have spoken."
26Ezk 21:18 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 21:19 "Now you, son of man, mark out two roads that the sword of Babylon's king can take. Both of them should originate from the same land. And make a signpost at the fork in the road to [each] city.
26Ezk 21:20 Mark out a road that the sword can take to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
26Ezk 21:21 For the king of Babylon stands at the split in the road, at the fork of the two roads, to practice divination: he shakes the arrows, consults the idols, and observes the liver.
26Ezk 21:22 The answer marked Jerusalem appears in his right hand, [indicating] that he should set up battering rams, give the order to slaughter, raise a battle cry, set battering rams against the gates, build a ramp, and construct a siege wall.
26Ezk 21:23 It will seem like false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn an oath to the Babylonians, but it will draw attention to [their] guilt so that they will be captured.
26Ezk 21:24 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because you have drawn attention to your guilt, exposing your transgressions, so that your sins are revealed in all your actions, since you have done this, you will be captured by them.
26Ezk 21:25 And you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, the day has come for your punishment."
26Ezk 21:26 This is what the Lord God says: Remove the turban, and take off the crown. Things will not remain as they are; exalt the lowly and bring down the exalted.
26Ezk 21:27 A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin! Yet this will not happen until He comes; I have given the judgment to Him.
26Ezk 21:28 "Now prophesy, son of man, and say: This is what the Lord God says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt. You are to proclaim: Sword, sword! [You are] drawn for slaughter, polished to consume, to flash like lightning.
26Ezk 21:29 While they offer false visions and lying divinations about you, [the time] has come to put you to the necks of the profane wicked ones; the day has come for your punishment.
26Ezk 21:30 Return [it] to its sheath! I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your origin.
26Ezk 21:31 I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow the fire of My fury on you. I will hand you over to brutal men, skilled at destruction.
26Ezk 21:32 You will be fuel for the fire. Your blood will be [spilled] in the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken."
26Ezk 22:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:2 "Now, son of man, will you pass judgment? Will you pass judgment against the city of blood? Then explain all her abominations to her.
26Ezk 22:3 You are to say: This is what the Lord God says: A city that sheds blood within her [walls] so that her time of judgment has come and who makes idols for herself so that she is defiled!
26Ezk 22:4 You are guilty of the blood you have shed, and you are defiled from the idols you have made. You have brought your [judgment] days near and have come to your years [of punishment]. Therefore, I have made you a disgrace to the nations and a mockery to all the lands.
26Ezk 22:5 Those who are near and those far away from you will mock you, you infamous one full of turmoil.
26Ezk 22:6 "Look, every prince of Israel within you has used his strength to shed blood.
26Ezk 22:7 Father and mother are treated with contempt, and the foreign resident is exploited within you. The fatherless and widow are oppressed in you.
26Ezk 22:8 You despise My holy things and profane My Sabbaths.
26Ezk 22:9 There are men within you who slander in order to shed blood. People who [live] in you eat at the mountain [shrines]; they commit immoral acts within you.
26Ezk 22:10 Men within you have sexual intercourse with [their] father's wife, and violate women during their menstrual impurity.
26Ezk 22:11 One man within you commits an abomination with his neighbor's wife; another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law; and [yet] another violates his sister, his father's daughter.
26Ezk 22:12 People who [live] in you accept bribes in order to shed blood. You take interest and profit [on a loan] and brutally extort your neighbors. You have forgotten Me." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 22:13 "Now look, I clap My hands together against the unjust gain you have made and against the blood shed among you.
26Ezk 22:14 Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the days when I deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will act.
26Ezk 22:15 I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you among the countries; I will purge your uncleanness.
26Ezk 22:16 You will be profaned in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 22:17 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me. All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
26Ezk 22:19 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Because all of you have become dross, I am about to gather you into Jerusalem.
26Ezk 22:20 Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace to blow fire on them and melt them, so I will gather [you] in My anger and wrath, put you [inside], and melt you.
26Ezk 22:21 Yes, I will gather you together and blow on you with the fire of My fury, and you will be melted within the city.
26Ezk 22:22 As silver is melted inside a furnace, so you will be melted inside the city. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath on you."
26Ezk 22:23 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 22:24 "Son of man, say to her: You are a land that has not been cleansed, that has not received rain in the day of indignation.
26Ezk 22:25 The conspiracy of her prophets within her is like a roaring lion tearing [its] prey: they devour people, seize wealth and valuables, and multiply the widows within her.
26Ezk 22:26 Her priests do violence to My law and profane My holy things. They make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they do not explain the difference between the clean and the unclean. They disregard My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
26Ezk 22:27 "Her officials within her are like wolves tearing [their] prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives in order to get unjust gain.
26Ezk 22:28 Her prophets plaster with whitewash for them by seeing false visions and lying divinations, and they say: This is what the Lord God says, when the LORD has not spoken.
26Ezk 22:29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy and unlawfully exploited the foreign resident.
26Ezk 22:30 I searched for a man among them who would repair the wall and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land so that I might not destroy it, but I found no one.
26Ezk 22:31 So I have poured out My indignation on them and consumed them with the fire of My fury. I have brought their actions down on their own heads." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 23:1 The word of the LORD came to me again:
26Ezk 23:2 "Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother,
26Ezk 23:3 who acted like prostitutes in Egypt, behaving promiscuously in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin nipples caressed.
26Ezk 23:4 The older one was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah represents Samaria and Oholibah represents Jerusalem.
26Ezk 23:5 "Oholah acted like a prostitute even though she was Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians: warriors
26Ezk 23:6 dressed in blue, governors and prefects, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on steeds.
26Ezk 23:7 She offered her sexual favors to them; all of them were the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all those she lusted after and with all their idols.
26Ezk 23:8 She didn't give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her virgin nipples, and poured out their lust on her.
26Ezk 23:9 Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians she lusted for.
26Ezk 23:10 They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. Since they executed judgment against her, she became notorious among women.
26Ezk 23:11 "Now her sister Oholibah saw [this], but she was [even] more depraved in her lust than Oholah, and made her promiscuous acts worse than those of her sister.
26Ezk 23:12 She lusted after the Assyrians: governors and prefects, warriors splendidly dressed, horsemen riding on steeds, all of them desirable young men.
26Ezk 23:13 And I saw that she had defiled herself; both of them [had taken] the same path.
26Ezk 23:14 But she increased her promiscuity when she saw male figures carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion,
26Ezk 23:15 wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers, a depiction of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
26Ezk 23:16 At the sight of them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:17 Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and defiled her with their lust. But after she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.
26Ezk 23:18 When she flaunted her promiscuity and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust just as I turned away from her sister.
26Ezk 23:19 Yet she multiplied her acts of promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth when she acted like a prostitute in the land of Egypt
26Ezk 23:20 and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions.
26Ezk 23:21 So you revisited the indecency of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your nipples to enjoy your youthful breasts.
26Ezk 23:22 "Therefore Oholibah, this is what the Lord God says: I am going to incite your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust. I will bring them against you from every side:
26Ezk 23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, and Koa; and all the Assyrians with them-- desirable young men, all of them governors and prefects, officers and administrators, all of them riding on horses.
26Ezk 23:24 They will come against you with an alliance of nations and with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will set themselves against you on every side with shields, bucklers, and helmets. I will delegate judgment to them, and they will judge you by their own standards.
26Ezk 23:25 When I vent My jealous rage on you, they will deal with you in wrath. They will cut off your nose and ears, and your descendants will fall by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and your descendants will be consumed by fire.
26Ezk 23:26 They will strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry.
26Ezk 23:27 So I will put an end to your indecency and sexual immorality, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not look longingly at them or remember Egypt any more.
26Ezk 23:28 "For this is what the Lord God says: I am going to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.
26Ezk 23:29 They will treat you with hatred, take all you have worked for, and leave you stark naked, so that the shame of your debauchery will be exposed, both your indecency and promiscuity.
26Ezk 23:30 These things will be done to you because you acted like a prostitute with the nations, defiling yourself with their idols.
26Ezk 23:31 You have followed the path of your sister, so I will put her cup in your hand."
26Ezk 23:32 This is what the Lord God says: You will drink your sister's cup, which is deep and wide. You will be an object of ridicule and scorn, for it holds [so] much.
26Ezk 23:33 You will be filled with drunkenness and grief, with a cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
26Ezk 23:34 You will drink it and drain [it]; then you will gnaw its broken pieces, and tear your breasts. For I have spoken. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 23:35 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: "Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your indecency and promiscuity."
26Ezk 23:36 Then the LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their abominations to them.
26Ezk 23:37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; they have committed adultery with their idols. They have even made the children they bore to Me pass through [the fire] as food for the idols.
26Ezk 23:38 They also did this to Me: they defiled My sanctuary on that same day and profaned My Sabbaths.
26Ezk 23:39 On the same day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary to profane it. Yes, that is what they did inside My house.
26Ezk 23:40 "In addition, they sent for men who came from far away when a messenger was dispatched to them. And look how they came! You bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry for them.
26Ezk 23:41 You sat on a luxurious couch with a table spread before it, on which you had set My incense and oil.
26Ezk 23:42 The sound of a carefree crowd was there. Drunkards from the desert were brought in, along with common men. They put bracelets on the women's hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26Ezk 23:43 Then I said concerning this woman worn out by adultery: Will they now have illicit sex with her, even her?
26Ezk 23:44 Yet they had sex with her as one does with a prostitute. This is how they had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, those obscene women.
26Ezk 23:45 But righteous men will judge them the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged, for they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
26Ezk 23:46 "This is what the Lord God says: Summon an assembly against them and consign them to terror and plunder.
26Ezk 23:47 The assembly will stone them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire.
26Ezk 23:48 So I will put an end to indecency in the land, and all the women will be admonished not to imitate your indecent behavior.
26Ezk 23:49 They will repay you for your indecency, and you will bear the consequences for your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Lord God."
26Ezk 24:1 The word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth [day] of the month:
26Ezk 24:2 "Son of man, write down today's date, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
26Ezk 24:3 Now speak a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them: This is what the Lord God says: Put the pot on [the fire]-- put [it] on, and then pour water into it!
26Ezk 24:4 Place the pieces of meat in it, every good piece-- thigh and shoulder. Fill it with choice bones.
26Ezk 24:5 Take the choicest of the flock and also pile up the fuel under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it."
26Ezk 24:6 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, the pot that has rust inside it, and whose rust will not come off! Empty it piece by piece; lots should not be cast for its contents.
26Ezk 24:7 For the blood she shed is in her midst. She put it out on the bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.
26Ezk 24:8 In order to stir up wrath and take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered.
26Ezk 24:9 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I Myself will make the pile of kindling large.
26Ezk 24:10 Pile on the logs and kindle the fire! Cook the meat well and mix in the spices! Let the bones be burned!
26Ezk 24:11 Set the empty pot on its coals so that it becomes hot and its copper glows. Then its impurity will melt inside it; its rust will be consumed.
26Ezk 24:12 It has frustrated every effort; its thick rust will not come off. Into the fire with its rust!
26Ezk 24:13 Because of the indecency of your uncleanness-- since I tried to purify you, but you would not be purified from your uncleanness-- you will not be pure again until I have satisfied My wrath on you.
26Ezk 24:14 I, the LORD, have spoken. It is coming, and I will do it! I will not refrain, I will not show pity, and I will not relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 24:15 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:16 "Son of man, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a fatal blow. But you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow.
26Ezk 24:17 Groan quietly; do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover [your] mustache or eat the bread of mourners."
26Ezk 24:18 I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did just as I was commanded.
26Ezk 24:19 Then the people asked me, "Won't you tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?"
26Ezk 24:20 So I answered them: "The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 24:21 'Say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your heart. Also, the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.
26Ezk 24:22 Then you will do just as I have done: You will not cover [your] mustache or eat the bread of mourners.
26Ezk 24:23 Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not lament or weep but will waste away because of your sins and will groan to one another.
26Ezk 24:24 Now Ezekiel will be a sign for you. You will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God.
26Ezk 24:25 " 'Son of man, know that on the day I take their stronghold from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes and the longing of their hearts, [as well as] their sons and daughters,
26Ezk 24:26 on that day a fugitive will come to you and report the news.
26Ezk 24:27 On that day your mouth will be opened [to talk] with him; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am the LORD.'"
26Ezk 25:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 25:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 25:3 Say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord God: This is what the Lord God says: Because you said: Good! about My sanctuary when it was desecrated, about the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and about the house of Judah when they went into exile,
26Ezk 25:4 therefore I am about to give you to the people of the east as a possession. They will set up their encampments and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
26Ezk 25:5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a sheepfold. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 25:6 For this is what the Lord God says: "Because you clapped [your] hands, stamped [your] feet, and rejoiced over the land of Israel with wholehearted contempt,
26Ezk 25:7 therefore I am about to stretch out My hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and eliminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 25:8 This is what the Lord God says: "Because Moab and Seir said: Look, the house of Judah is like all the [other] nations,
26Ezk 25:9 therefore I am about to expose Moab's flank beginning with its frontier cities, the pride of the land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
26Ezk 25:10 I will give it along with Ammon to the people of the east as a possession, so that Ammon will not be remembered among the nations.
26Ezk 25:11 So I will execute judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 25:12 This is what the Lord God says: "Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah and incurred grievous guilt by taking revenge on them,
26Ezk 25:13 therefore this is what the Lord God says: I will stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off both man and animal from it. I will make it a wasteland; they will fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan.
26Ezk 25:14 I will take My vengeance on Edom through My people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath. So they will know My vengeance." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 25:15 This is what the Lord God says: "Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with deep contempt, destroying [because of their] ancient hatred,
26Ezk 25:16 therefore this is what the Lord God says: I am about to stretch out My hand against the Philistines, cutting off the Cherethites and wiping out what remains of the coastal peoples.
26Ezk 25:17 I will execute great vengeance against them with furious rebukes. They will know that I am the LORD when I take My vengeance on them."
26Ezk 26:1 In the eleventh year, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 26:2 "Son of man, because Tyre said about Jerusalem: Good! The gateway to the peoples is shattered. She has been turned over to me. I will be filled [now that] she lies in ruins,
26Ezk 26:3 therefore this is what the Lord God says: See, I am against you, Tyre! I will raise up many nations against you, just as the sea raises its waves.
26Ezk 26:4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers. I will scrape the soil from her and turn her into a bare rock.
26Ezk 26:5 She will become a place in the sea to spread nets, for I have spoken." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "She will become plunder for the nations,
26Ezk 26:6 and her villages on the mainland will be slaughtered by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 26:7 For this is what the Lord God says: "See, I am about to bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre from the north with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a vast company of troops.
26Ezk 26:8 He will slaughter your villages on the mainland with the sword. He will set up siege works against you, and will build a ramp and raise a wall of shields against you.
26Ezk 26:9 He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and tear down your towers with his iron tools.
26Ezk 26:10 His horses will be so numerous that their dust will cover you. When he enters your gates as [an army] entering a breached city, your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots.
26Ezk 26:11 He will trample all your streets with the hooves of his horses. He will slaughter your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
26Ezk 26:12 They will take your wealth as spoil and plunder your merchandise. They will also demolish your walls and tear down your beautiful homes. Then they will throw your stones, timber, and soil into the water.
26Ezk 26:13 I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your lyres will no longer be heard.
26Ezk 26:14 I will turn you into a bare rock, and you will be a place to spread nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, the LORD, have spoken." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 26:15 This is what the Lord God says to Tyre: "Won't the coasts and islands quake at the sound of your downfall, when the wounded groan and slaughter occurs within you?
26Ezk 26:16 All the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble continually, and be appalled at you.
26Ezk 26:17 Then they will lament for you and say of you: How you have perished, city of renown, you who were populated from the seas! She who was powerful on the sea, she and all of her inhabitants inflicted their terror.
26Ezk 26:18 Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall; the islands in the sea are alarmed by your demise."
26Ezk 26:19 For this is what the Lord God says: "When I make you a ruined city like [other] deserted cities, when I raise up the deep against you so that the mighty waters cover you,
26Ezk 26:20 then I will bring you down [to be] with those who descend to the Pit, to the people of antiquity. I will make you dwell in the underworld like the ancient ruins, with those who descend to the Pit, so that you will no longer be inhabited or display [your] splendor in the land of the living.
26Ezk 26:21 I will make you an object of horror, and you will no longer exist. You will be sought but will never be found again." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 27:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 27:2 "Now, son of man, lament for Tyre.
26Ezk 27:3 Say to Tyre, who is located at the entrance of the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coasts and islands: This is what the Lord God says: Tyre, you declared: I am perfect in beauty.
26Ezk 27:4 Your realm was in the heart of the sea; your builders perfected your beauty.
26Ezk 27:5 They constructed all your planking with pine trees from Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26Ezk 27:6 They made your oars of oaks from Bashan. They made your deck of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus, [inlaid] with ivory.
26Ezk 27:7 Your sail was [made of] fine embroidered linen from Egypt, and served as your banner. Your awning was of blue and purple fabric from the coasts of Elishah.
26Ezk 27:8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men were within you, Tyre; they were your helmsmen.
26Ezk 27:9 The elders of Gebal and its wise men were within you, repairing your leaks. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came to you to barter for your goods.
26Ezk 27:10 [Men of] Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, [serving] as your warriors. They hung shields and helmets in you; they gave you splendor.
26Ezk 27:11 Men of Arvad and Helech were [stationed] on your walls all around, and Gamadites were in your towers. They hung their shields all around your walls; they perfected your beauty.
26Ezk 27:12 "Tarshish was your trading partner because of [your] great wealth of every kind. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your goods.
26Ezk 27:14 Those from Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:15 Men of Dedanwere also your merchants; many coasts and islands were your regular markets. They brought back ivory tusks and ebony as your payment.
26Ezk 27:16 Aramwas your trading partner because of your numerous products. They exchanged turquoise, purple and embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:17 Judah and the land of Israel were your merchants. They exchanged wheat from Minnith, meal, honey, oil, and balm for your goods.
26Ezk 27:18 Damascus was also your trading partner because of your numerous products and your great wealth of every kind, [trading] in wine from Helbon and white wool.
26Ezk 27:19 Vedan and Javan from Uzaldealt in your merchandise; wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane were [exchanged] for your goods.
26Ezk 27:20 Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
26Ezk 27:21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your business partners, trading with you in lambs, rams, and goats.
26Ezk 27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. They exchanged gold, the best of all spices, and all kinds of precious stones for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you.
26Ezk 27:24 They were your merchants in choice garments, cloaks of blue and embroidered materials, and multicolored carpets, which were bound and secured with cords in your marketplace.
26Ezk 27:25 Ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your goods. So you became full and heavily loaded in the heart of the sea.
26Ezk 27:26 Your rowers have brought you onto the high seas, but the east wind has shattered you in the heart of the sea.
26Ezk 27:27 Your wealth, merchandise, and goods, your sailors and helmsmen, those who repair your leaks, those who barter for your goods, and all the warriors within you, with all the other people on board, sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall.
26Ezk 27:28 The countryside shakes at the sound of your sailors' cries.
26Ezk 27:29 All those who handle an oar disembark from their ships. The sailors and all the helmsmen of the sea stand on the shore.
26Ezk 27:30 They raise their voices over you and cry out bitterly. They throw dust on their heads; they roll in ashes.
26Ezk 27:31 They shave their heads because of you and wrap themselves in sackcloth. They weep over you with deep anguish and bitter mourning.
26Ezk 27:32 In their wailing they lament for you, mourning over you: Who was like Tyre, silenced in the middle of the sea?
26Ezk 27:33 When your merchandise was unloaded from the seas, you satisfied many peoples. You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and goods.
26Ezk 27:34 Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your goods and the people within you have gone down.
26Ezk 27:35 All the inhabitants of the coasts and islands are appalled at you. Their kings shudder with fear; [their] faces are contorted.
26Ezk 27:36 Those who trade among the peoples hiss at you; you have become an object of horror and will never exist again."
26Ezk 28:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:2 "Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre: This is what the Lord God says: Your heart is proud, and you have said: I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea. Yet you are a man and not a god, though you have regarded your heart as that of a god.
26Ezk 28:3 Yes, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you!
26Ezk 28:4 By your wisdom and understanding you have acquired wealth for yourself. You have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries.
26Ezk 28:5 By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has become proud because of your wealth."
26Ezk 28:6 Therefore this is what the Lord God says: Because you regard your heart as that of a god,
26Ezk 28:7 I am about to bring strangers against you, ruthless men from the nations. They will draw their swords against your magnificent wisdom and will defile your splendor.
26Ezk 28:8 They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the sea.
26Ezk 28:9 Will you still say: I am a god, in the presence of those who kill you? Yet you will be [shown to be] a man, not a god, in the hands of those who kill you.
26Ezk 28:10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of strangers. For I have spoken. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 28:11 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:12 "Son of man, lament for the king of Tyre and say to him: This is what the Lord God says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
26Ezk 28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone covered you: carnelian, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold; they were prepared on the day you were created.
26Ezk 28:14 You were an anointed guardian cherub, for I had appointed you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
26Ezk 28:15 From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways until wickedness was found in you.
26Ezk 28:16 Through the abundance of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I expelled you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and banished you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
26Ezk 28:17 Your heart became proud because of your beauty; For the sake of your splendor you corrupted your wisdom. So I threw you down to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
26Ezk 28:18 You profaned your sanctuaries by the magnitude of your iniquities in your dishonest trade. So I sent out fire from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of everyone watching you.
26Ezk 28:19 All those who know you among the nations are appalled at you. You have become an object of horror and will never exist again."
26Ezk 28:20 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 28:21 "Son of man, turn your face toward Sidon and prophesy against it.
26Ezk 28:22 You are to say: This is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against you, Sidon, and I will display My glory within you. They will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate My holiness through her.
26Ezk 28:23 I will send a plague against her and bloodshed in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 28:24 "The house of Israel will no longer be hurt by prickling briers or painful thorns from all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.
26Ezk 28:25 "This is what the Lord God says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are scattered and demonstrate My holiness through them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their own land, which I gave to My servant Jacob.
26Ezk 28:26 They will live there securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute judgments against all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God."
26Ezk 29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth [month] on the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt.
26Ezk 29:3 Speak [to him] and say: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monsterlying in the middle of his Nile, who says: My Nile is my own; I made [it] for myself.
26Ezk 29:4 I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams cling to your scales. I will haul you up from the middle of your Nile, and all the fish of your streams will cling to your scales.
26Ezk 29:5 I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open ground and will not be taken away or gathered [for burial]. I have given you to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky as food.
26Ezk 29:6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, for they have been a staff [made] of reed to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 29:7 When Israel grasped you by the hand, you splintered, tearing all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you shattered and made all their hips unsteady.
26Ezk 29:8 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says: I am going to bring a sword against you and wipe out man and animal from you.
26Ezk 29:9 The land of Egypt will be a desolate ruin. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said: The Nile is my own; I made [it],
26Ezk 29:10 therefore, I am against you and your Nile. I will turn the land of Egypt into ruins, a desolate waste from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush.
26Ezk 29:11 No human foot will pass through it, and no animal foot will pass through it. It will be uninhabited for 40 years.
26Ezk 29:12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolate lands, and its cities will be a desolation among ruined cities for 40 years. I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them across the countries.
26Ezk 29:13 "For this is what the Lord God says: At the end of 40 years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were dispersed.
26Ezk 29:14 I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin. There they will be a lowly kingdom.
26Ezk 29:15 Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself over the nations. I will make them so small they cannot rule over the nations.
26Ezk 29:16 It will never again be an object of trust for the house of Israel, drawing attention to their sin of turning to the Egyptians. Then they will know that I am the Lord God."
26Ezk 29:17 In the twenty-seventh year in the first [month], on the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 29:18 "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor strenuously against Tyre. Every head was made bald and every shoulder chafed, but he and his army received no compensation from Tyre for the labor he expended against it.
26Ezk 29:19 Therefore this is what the Lord God says: I am going to give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will carry off its wealth, seizing its spoil and taking its plunder. This will be his army's compensation.
26Ezk 29:20 I have given him the land of Egypt as the pay he labored for, since they worked for Me." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 29:21 "In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will enable you to speak out among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 30:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:2 "Son of man, prophesy and say: This is what the Lord God says: Wail: Alas for the day!
26Ezk 30:3 For a day is near; a day belonging to the LORD is near. It will be a day of clouds, a time [of doom] for the nations.
26Ezk 30:4 A sword will come against Egypt, and there will be anguish in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt, and its wealth is taken away, and its foundations are torn down.
26Ezk 30:5 Cush, Put, and Lud, and all the various foreign troops, plus Libya and the men of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with them.
26Ezk 30:6 This is what the LORD says: Those who support Egypt will fall, and its proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene they will fall within it by the sword. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 30:7 They will be desolate among desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
26Ezk 30:8 They will know that I am the LORD when I set fire to Egypt and all its allies are shattered.
26Ezk 30:9 On that day, messengers will go out from Me in ships to terrify confident Cush. Anguish will come over them on the day of Egypt's [doom]. For indeed it is coming."
26Ezk 30:10 This is what the Lord God says: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26Ezk 30:11 He along with his people, ruthless men from the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
26Ezk 30:12 I will make the streams dry and sell the land into the hands of evil men. I will bring desolation on the land and everything in it by the hands of foreigners. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 30:13 This is what the Lord God says: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the false gods in Memphis. There will no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt. So I will instill fear in that land.
26Ezk 30:14 I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments on Thebes.
26Ezk 30:15 I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and will wipe out the crowds of Thebes.
26Ezk 30:16 I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be breached, and Memphis will face foes in broad daylight.
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and those cities will go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:18 The day will be dark in Tehaphnehes, when I break the yoke of Egypt there and its proud strength comes to an end in the city. A cloud will cover Tehaphnehes, and its villages will go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:19 So I will execute judgments against Egypt, and they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 30:20 In the eleventh year, in the first [month], on the seventh [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 30:21 "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Look, it has not been bandaged-- [no] medicine has been applied and no splint put on to bandage it so that it can grow strong [enough] to handle a sword.
26Ezk 30:22 Therefore this is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one [already] broken, and will make the sword fall from his hand.
26Ezk 30:23 I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
26Ezk 30:24 I will strengthen the arms of Babylon's king and place My sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him as a mortally wounded man.
26Ezk 30:25 I will strengthen the arms of Babylon's king, but Pharaoh's arms will fall. They will know that I am the LORD when I place My sword in the hand of Babylon's king and he wields it against the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 30:26 When I disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries, they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 31:1 In the eleventh year, in the third [month], on the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 31:2 "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: Who are you like in your greatness?
26Ezk 31:3 Think of Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches and shady foliage, and of lofty height. Its top was among the clouds.
26Ezk 31:4 The waters caused it to grow; the underground springs made it tall, directing their rivers all around the place where the tree was planted and sending their channels to all the trees of the field.
26Ezk 31:5 Therefore the cedar became greater in height than all the trees of the field. Its branches multiplied, and its boughs grew long as it spread [them] out because of the plentiful water.
26Ezk 31:6 All the birds of the sky nested in its branches, and all the animals of the field gave birth beneath its boughs; all the great nations lived in its shade.
26Ezk 31:7 It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its limbs, for its roots extended to abundant water.
26Ezk 31:8 The cedars in God's garden could not rival it; the pine trees couldn't compare with its branches, nor could the plane trees match its boughs. No tree in the garden of God could compare with it in beauty.
26Ezk 31:9 I made it beautiful with its many limbs, and all the trees of Eden, which were in God's garden, envied it.
26Ezk 31:10 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says: Since it became great in height and set its top among the clouds, and it grew proud on account of its height,
26Ezk 31:11 I determined to hand it over to a ruler of nations; he would surely deal with it. I banished it because of its wickedness.
26Ezk 31:12 Foreigners, ruthless men from the nations, cut it down and left it lying. Its limbs fell on the mountains and in every valley; its boughs lay broken in all the earth's ravines. All the peoples of the earth left its shade and abandoned it.
26Ezk 31:13 All the birds of the sky nested on its fallen trunk, and all the animals of the field were among its boughs.
26Ezk 31:14 [This happened] so that no trees [planted] beside water would become great in height and set their tops among the clouds, and so that no [other] well-watered trees would reach them in height. For they have all been consigned to death, to the underworld, among the people who descend to the Pit.
26Ezk 31:15 "This is what the Lord God says: I caused grieving on the day the cedar went down to Sheol. I closed off the underground deep because of it: I held back the rivers of the deep, and [its] abundant waters were restrained. I made Lebanon mourn on account of it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
26Ezk 31:16 I made the nations quake at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to Sheol [to be] with those who descend to the Pit. Then all the trees of Eden, all the well-watered trees, the choice and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the underworld.
26Ezk 31:17 They too descended with it to Sheol, to those slain by the sword. As its alliesthey had lived in its shade among the nations.
26Ezk 31:18 "Who then are you like in glory and greatness among Eden's trees? You also will be brought down to the underworld [to be] with the trees of Eden. You will lie among the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his hordes"-- the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:2 "Son of man, lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: You compare yourself to a lion of the nations, but you are like a monster in the seas. You thrash about in your rivers, churn up the waters with your feet, and muddy the rivers."
26Ezk 32:3 This is what the Lord God says: I will spread My net over you with an assembly of many peoples, and they will haul you up in My net.
26Ezk 32:4 I will abandon you on the land and hurl you on the open field. I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you and let the beasts of the entire earth eat their fill of you.
26Ezk 32:5 I will put your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your carcass.
26Ezk 32:6 I will drench the land with the flow of your blood, [even] to the mountains; the ravines will be filled with your [gore].
26Ezk 32:7 When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.
26Ezk 32:8 I will darken all the shining lights in the heavens over you, and will bring darkness on your land. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:9 I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring about your destruction among the nations, in countries you do not know.
26Ezk 32:10 I will cause many nations to be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with fear because of you when I brandish My sword in front of them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life.
26Ezk 32:11 For this is what the Lord God says: The sword of Babylon's king will come against you!
26Ezk 32:12 I will make your hordes fall by the swords of warriors, all of them ruthless men from the nations. They will ravage Egypt's pride, and all its hordes will be destroyed.
26Ezk 32:13 I will slaughter all its cattle that are beside many waters. No human foot will churn them again, and no cattle hooves will disturb them.
26Ezk 32:14 Then I will let their waters settle and will make their rivers flow like oil. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:15 When I make the land of Egypt a desolation, so that it is emptied of everything in it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 32:16 "This is a lament that will be chanted; the women of the nations will chant it. They will chant it over Egypt and all its hordes." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:17 In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth [day] of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 32:18 "Son of man, wail over the hordes of Egypt and bring Egypt and the daughters of mighty nations down to the underworld, [to be] with those who descend to the Pit:
26Ezk 32:19 Whom do you surpass in loveliness? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!
26Ezk 32:20 They will fall among those slain by the sword. A sword is appointed! They drag her and all her hordes away.
26Ezk 32:21 Warrior leaders will speak from the middle of Sheol about him and his allies: They have come down; the uncircumcised lie slain by the sword.
26Ezk 32:22 Assyria is there with all her company; her graves are all around her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword.
26Ezk 32:23 Her graves are set in the deepest regions of the Pit, and her company is all around her burial place. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword-- they who [once] spread terror in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:24 Elam is there with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword-- they who went down to the underworld uncircumcised, who [once] spread their terror in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:25 Among the slain they prepare a resting place for Elam with all her hordes. Her graves are all around her. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was [once] spread in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit. They are placed among the slain.
26Ezk 32:26 Meshech and Tubalare there, with all their hordes. Their graves are all around them. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was [once] spread in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:27 They do not lie down with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were placed under their heads. The punishment for their sins rested on their bones, although the terror of [these] warriors was [once] in the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:28 But you will be shattered and will lie down among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.
26Ezk 32:29 Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who, despite their strength, have been placed among those slain by the sword. They lie down with the uncircumcised, with those who descend to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:30 All the leaders of the north and all the Sidonians are there. They went down in shame with the slain, despite the terror their strength inspired. They lie down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:31 Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his hordes-- Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword. [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:32 For I will spread My terror in the land of the living, so Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 33:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:2 "Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: Suppose I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land select a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman,
26Ezk 33:3 and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows his trumpet to warn the people.
26Ezk 33:4 Then, if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but ignores the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.
26Ezk 33:5 [Since] he heard the sound of the trumpet but ignored the warning, his blood is on his own hands. If he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.
26Ezk 33:6 However, if the watchman sees the sword coming but doesn't blow the trumpet, so that the people aren't warned, and the sword comes and takes away their lives, then they have been taken away because of their iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.
26Ezk 33:7 "As for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.
26Ezk 33:8 If I say to the wicked: Wicked one, you will surely die, but you do not speak out to warn him about his way, that wicked person will die for his iniquity, yet I will hold you responsible for his blood.
26Ezk 33:9 But if you warn a wicked person to turn from his way and he doesn't turn from it, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.
26Ezk 33:10 "Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel: You have said this: Our transgressions and our sins are [heavy] on us, and we are wasting away because of them! How then can we survive?
26Ezk 33:11 Tell them: As I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked person should turn from his way and live. Repent, repent of your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?
26Ezk 33:12 "Now, son of man, say to your people: The righteousness of the righteous person will not save him on the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked person cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. The righteous person won't be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins.
26Ezk 33:13 When I tell the righteous person that he will surely live, but he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, then none of his righteousness will be remembered, and he will die because of the iniquity he has committed.
26Ezk 33:14 "So when I tell the wicked person: You will surely die, but he repents of his sin and does what is just and right--
26Ezk 33:15 he returns collateral, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing iniquity-- he will certainly live; he will not die.
26Ezk 33:16 None of the sins he committed will be held against him. He has done what is just and right; he will certainly live.
26Ezk 33:17 "But your people say: The Lord's way isn't fair, even though it is their own way that isn't fair.
26Ezk 33:18 When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die on account of this.
26Ezk 33:19 But when a wicked person turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live because of this.
26Ezk 33:20 Yet you say: The Lord's way isn't fair. I will judge each of you according to his ways, house of Israel."
26Ezk 33:21 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth [month], on the fifth [day] of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and reported, "The city has been taken!"
26Ezk 33:22 Now the hand of the LORD had been on me the evening before the fugitive arrived, and He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer mute.
26Ezk 33:23 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 33:24 "Son of man, those who live in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying: Abraham was only one person, yet he received possession of the land. But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.
26Ezk 33:25 Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord God says: You eat [meat] with blood [in it], raise your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. Should you then receive possession of the land?
26Ezk 33:26 You have relied on your swords, you have committed abominations, and each of you has defiled his neighbor's wife. Should you then receive possession of the land?
26Ezk 33:27 "Tell them this: This is what the Lord God says: As surely as I live, those who are in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open field I have given to wild animals to be devoured, and those in the strongholds and caves will die by plague.
26Ezk 33:28 I will make the land a desolate waste, and its proud strength will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will become desolate, with no one passing through.
26Ezk 33:29 They will know that I am the LORD when I make the land a desolate waste because of all the abominations they have committed.
26Ezk 33:30 "Now, son of man, your people are talking about you near the [city] walls and in the doorways of their houses. One person speaks to another, each saying to his brother: Come and hear what the message is that comes from the LORD!
26Ezk 33:31 So My people come to you in crowds, sit in front of you, and hear your words, but they don't obey them. Although they express love with their mouths, their hearts pursue unjust gain.
26Ezk 33:32 Yes, to them you are like a singer of love songs who has a beautiful voice and plays skillfully on an instrument. They hear your words, but they don't obey them.
26Ezk 33:33 Yet when it comes-- and it will definitely come-- then they will know that a prophet has been among them."
26Ezk 34:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 34:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them: This is what the Lord God says to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves! Shouldn't the shepherds feed their flock?
26Ezk 34:3 You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fatlings, but you do not tend the flock.
26Ezk 34:4 You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty.
26Ezk 34:5 They were scattered for lack of a shepherd; they became food for all the wild animals when they were scattered.
26Ezk 34:6 My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the whole face of the earth, and there was no one searching or seeking [for them].
26Ezk 34:7 "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 34:8 As I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "because My flock has become [prey and] food for every wild animal since [they] lack a shepherd, for My shepherds do not search for My flock, and [because] the shepherds feed themselves rather than My flock,
26Ezk 34:9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD!
26Ezk 34:10 "This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against the shepherds. I will demand My flock from them and prevent them from shepherding the flock. The shepherds will no longer feed themselves, for I will rescue My flock from their mouths so that they will not be food for them.
26Ezk 34:11 "For this is what the Lord God says: See, I Myself will search for My flock and look for them.
26Ezk 34:12 As a shepherd looks for his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will look for My flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy and dark day.
26Ezk 34:13 I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will shepherd them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the land.
26Ezk 34:14 I will tend them with good pasture, and their grazing place will be on Israel's lofty mountains. There they will lie down in a good grazing place; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 34:15 I will tend My flock and let them lie down." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 34:16 "I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bandage the injured, and strengthen the weak, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will shepherd them with justice.
26Ezk 34:17 "The Lord God says to you, My flock: I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and male goats.
26Ezk 34:18 Isn't it enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or [isn't it enough] that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
26Ezk 34:19 Yet My flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied.
26Ezk 34:20 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says to them: See, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26Ezk 34:21 Since you have pushed with flank and shoulder and butted all the weak ones with your horns until you scattered them all over,
26Ezk 34:22 I will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey for you. I will judge between one sheep and another.
26Ezk 34:23 I will appoint over them a single shepherd, My servant David, and he will shepherd them. He will tend them himself and will be their shepherd.
26Ezk 34:24 I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be a prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26Ezk 34:25 "I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate dangerous animals in the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest.
26Ezk 34:26 I will make them and the area around My hill a blessing: I will send down showers in their season-- showers of blessing.
26Ezk 34:27 The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslave them.
26Ezk 34:28 They will no longer be prey for the nations, and the wild animals of the land will not consume them. They will live securely, and no one will frighten [them].
26Ezk 34:29 I will establish for them a place renowned for [its] agriculture, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land. They will no longer endure the insults of the nations.
26Ezk 34:30 Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 34:31 "You are My flock, the human flock of My pasture, and I am your God." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 35:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 35:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir and prophesy against it.
26Ezk 35:3 Say to it: This is what the Lord God says: Look! I am against you, Mount Seir. I will stretch out My hand against you and make you a desolate waste.
26Ezk 35:4 I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:5 "Because you maintained an ancient hatred and handed over the Israelites to the power of the sword in the time of their disaster, the time of final punishment,
26Ezk 35:6 therefore, as I live"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "I will destine you for bloodshed, and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.
26Ezk 35:7 I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.
26Ezk 35:8 I will fill its mountains with the slain; those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
26Ezk 35:9 I will make you a perpetual desolation; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 35:10 "Because you said: These two nations and two lands will be mine, and we will possess them-- though the LORD was there--
26Ezk 35:11 therefore, as I live"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "I will treat [you] according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them. I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
26Ezk 35:12 Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all the blasphemies you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate. They have been given to us to devour!
26Ezk 35:13 You boasted against Me with your mouth, and spoke many words against Me. I heard [it] Myself!
26Ezk 35:14 "This is what the Lord God says: While the whole world rejoices, I will make you a desolation.
26Ezk 35:15 Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it became a desolation, so I will deal with you: you will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and [so will] all Edom in its entirety. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:1 "Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
26Ezk 36:2 This is what the Lord God says: Because the enemy has said about you, 'Good! The ancient heights have become our possession,'
26Ezk 36:3 therefore, prophesy and say: This is what the Lord God says: Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you from every side, so that you became a possession for the rest of the nations and an object of people's gossip and slander,
26Ezk 36:4 therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have become plunder and a mockery to the rest of the nations all around.
26Ezk 36:5 "This is what the Lord God says: Certainly in My burning zeal I speak against the rest of the nations and all of Edom, who took My land as their own possession with wholehearted rejoicing and utter contempt, so that its pastureland became plunder.
26Ezk 36:6 Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I speak in My burning zeal because you have endured the insults of the nations.
26Ezk 36:7 Therefore this is what the Lord God says: I swear that the nations all around you will endure their own insults.
26Ezk 36:8 "You, mountains of Israel, will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel, since their arrival is near.
26Ezk 36:9 Look! I am on your side; I will turn toward you, and you will be tilled and sown.
26Ezk 36:10 I will fill you with people, with the whole house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:11 I will fill you with people and animals, and they will increase and be fruitful. I will make you inhabited as you once were and make [you] better off than you were before. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 36:12 I will cause people, My people Israel, to walk on you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance. You will no longer deprive them of [their] children.
26Ezk 36:13 "This is what the Lord God says: Because people are saying to you: You devour men and deprive your nation of children,
26Ezk 36:14 therefore, you will no longer devour men and deprive your nation of children." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 36:15 "I will no longer allow the insults of the nations to be heard against you, and you will not have to endure the reproach of the peoples any more; you will no longer cause your nation to stumble." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 36:16 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 36:17 "Son of man, while the house of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it with their conduct and actions. Their behavior before Me was like menstrual impurity.
26Ezk 36:18 So I poured out My wrath on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.
26Ezk 36:19 I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered among the countries. I judged them according to their conduct and actions.
26Ezk 36:20 When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said about them: These are the people of the LORD, yet they had to leave His land [in exile].
26Ezk 36:21 Then I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went.
26Ezk 36:22 "Therefore, say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: It is not for your sake that I will act, house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you profaned among the nations where you went.
26Ezk 36:23 I will honor the holiness of My great name, which has been profaned among the nations-- the name you have profaned among them. The nations will know that I am Yahweh"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "when I demonstrate My holiness through you in their sight.
26Ezk 36:24 "For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
26Ezk 36:25 I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.
26Ezk 36:26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
26Ezk 36:27 I will place My Spirit within you and cause you to follow My statutes and carefully observe My ordinances.
26Ezk 36:28 Then you will live in the land that I gave your fathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God.
26Ezk 36:29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will summon the grain and make it plentiful, and will not bring famine on you.
26Ezk 36:30 I will also make the fruit of the trees and the produce of the field plentiful, so that you will no longer experience reproach among the nations on account of famine.
26Ezk 36:31 "Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and abominations.
26Ezk 36:32 It is not for your sake that I will act"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "let this be known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated because of your ways, house of Israel!
26Ezk 36:33 "This is what the Lord God says: On the day I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:34 The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of everyone who passes by.
26Ezk 36:35 Then they will say: This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are [now] fortified and inhabited.
26Ezk 36:36 Then the nations that remain around you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken and I will do [it].
26Ezk 36:37 "This is what the Lord God says: I will respond to the house of Israel and do this for them: I will multiply them in number like a flock.
26Ezk 36:38 So the ruined cities will be filled with a flock of people, just as the flock of sheep for sacrifice is filled in Jerusalem during its appointed festivals. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 37:1 The hand of the LORD was on me, and He brought me out by His Spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones.
26Ezk 37:2 He led me all around them. There were a great many of them on the surface of the valley, and they were very dry.
26Ezk 37:3 Then He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" I replied, "Lord God, [only] You know."
26Ezk 37:4 He said to me, "Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!
26Ezk 37:5 This is what the Lord God says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will live.
26Ezk 37:6 I will put tendons on you, make flesh grow on you, and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you so that you come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
26Ezk 37:7 So I prophesied as I had been commanded. While I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone.
26Ezk 37:8 As I looked, tendons appeared on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
26Ezk 37:9 He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man. Say to it: This is what the Lord God says: Breath, come from the four winds and breathe into these slain so that they may live!"
26Ezk 37:10 So I prophesied as He commanded me; the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, a vast army.
26Ezk 37:11 Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Look how they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off.
26Ezk 37:12 Therefore, prophesy and say to them: This is what the Lord God says: I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them, My people, and lead you into the land of Israel.
26Ezk 37:13 You will know that I am the LORD, My people, when I open your graves and bring you up from them.
26Ezk 37:14 I will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am the LORD. I have spoken, and I will do [it]." [This is] the declaration of the LORD.
26Ezk 37:15 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 37:16 "Son of man, take a single stick and write on it: Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him. Then take another stick and write on it: Belonging to Joseph-- the stick of Ephraim-- and all the house of Israel associated with him.
26Ezk 37:17 Then join them together into a single stick so that they become one in your hand.
26Ezk 37:18 When your people ask you: Won't you explain to us what you mean by these things?--
26Ezk 37:19 tell them: This is what the Lord God says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph-- which is in the hand of Ephraim-- and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and put them together with the stick of Judah. I will make them into a single stick so that they become one in My hand.
26Ezk 37:20 "When the sticks you have written on are in your hand and in full view of the people,
26Ezk 37:21 tell them: This is what the Lord God says: I am going to take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land.
26Ezk 37:22 I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over all of them. They will no longer be two nations and will no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
26Ezk 37:23 They will not defile themselves any more with their idols, their detestable things, and all their transgressions. I will save them from all their apostasies by which they sinned, and I will cleanse them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God.
26Ezk 37:24 My servant David will be king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow My ordinances, and keep My statutes and obey them.
26Ezk 37:25 "They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They will live in it forever with their children and grandchildren, and My servant David will be their prince forever.
26Ezk 37:26 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will establish and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary among them forever.
26Ezk 37:27 My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be My people.
26Ezk 37:28 When My sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the LORD, sanctify Israel."
26Ezk 38:1 The word of the LORD came to me:
26Ezk 38:2 "Son of man, turn your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him
26Ezk 38:3 and say: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
26Ezk 38:4 I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your army, including horses and riders, who are all splendidly dressed, a huge company armed with shields and bucklers, all of them brandishing swords.
26Ezk 38:5 Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shields and helmets;
26Ezk 38:6 Gomer with all its troops; and Beth-togarmah from the remotest parts of the north along with all its troops-- many peoples are with you.
26Ezk 38:7 "Be prepared and get yourself ready, you and all your company who have been mobilized around you; you will be their guard.
26Ezk 38:8 After a long time you will be summoned. In the last years you will enter a land that has been restored from war and regathered from many peoples to the mountains of Israel, which had long been a ruin. They were brought out from the peoples, and all of them [now] live securely.
26Ezk 38:9 You, all of your troops, and many peoples with you will advance, coming like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.
26Ezk 38:10 "This is what the Lord God says: On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
26Ezk 38:11 You will say: I will go up against a land of open villages; I will come against a tranquil people who are living securely, all of them living without walls and without bars or gates--
26Ezk 38:12 in order to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against ruins now inhabited and against a people gathered from the nations, who have been acquiring cattle and possessions and who live at the center of the world.
26Ezk 38:13 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its rulers will ask you: Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hordes to carry off plunder, to make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and possessions, to seize great spoil?
26Ezk 38:14 "Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: This is what the Lord God says: On that day when My people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know [this]
26Ezk 38:15 and come from your place in the remotest parts of the north-- you and many peoples with you, who are all riding horses-- a mighty horde, a huge army?
26Ezk 38:16 You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the last days, Gog, that I will bring you against My land so that the nations may know Me, when I show Myself holy through you in their sight.
26Ezk 38:17 "This is what the Lord God says: Are you the one I spoke about in former times through My servants, the prophets of Israel, who for years prophesied in those times that I would bring you against them?
26Ezk 38:18 Now on that day, the day when Gog comes against the land of Israel"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "My wrath will flare up.
26Ezk 38:19 I swear in My zeal and fiery rage: On that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
26Ezk 38:20 The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, every creature that crawls on the ground, and every human being on the face of the earth will tremble before Me. The mountains will be thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground.
26Ezk 38:21 I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains"-- the declaration of the Lord God-- "and every man's sword will be against his brother.
26Ezk 38:22 I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed. I will pour out torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone on him, as well as his troops and the many peoples who are with him.
26Ezk 38:23 I will display My greatness and holiness, and will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:1 "As for you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
26Ezk 39:2 I will turn you around, drive you on, and lead you up from the remotest parts of the north. I will bring you against the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 39:3 Then I will knock your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
26Ezk 39:4 You, all your troops, and the peoples who are with you will fall on the mountains of Israel. I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and to the wild animals.
26Ezk 39:5 You will fall on the open field, for I have spoken." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:6 "I will send fire against Magog and those who live securely on the coasts and islands. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
26Ezk 39:7 So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel and will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
26Ezk 39:8 Yes, it is coming, and it will happen." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God. "This is the day I have spoken about.
26Ezk 39:9 "Then the inhabitants of Israel's cities will go out, kindle fires, and burn the weapons-- the bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them to make fires.
26Ezk 39:10 They will not gather wood from the countryside or cut [it] down from the forests, for they will use the weapons to make fires. They will take the loot from those who looted them and plunder those who plundered them." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:11 "Now on that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel-- the Valley of the Travelers east of the Sea. It will block those who travel through, for Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So [it] will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:12 The house of Israel will spend seven months burying them in order to cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:13 All the people of the land will bury [them] and their fame will spread on the day I display My glory." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:14 "They will appoint men on a full-time basis to pass through the land and bury the invaders who remain on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. They will make [their] search at the end of the seven months.
26Ezk 39:15 When they pass through the land and one of them sees a human bone, he will erect a marker next to it until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
26Ezk 39:16 There will even be a city named Hamonah [there]. So they will cleanse the land.
26Ezk 39:17 "Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: Tell every kind of bird and all the wild animals: Assemble and come! Gather from all around to My sacrificial feast that I am slaughtering for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel; you will eat flesh and drink blood.
26Ezk 39:18 You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the earth's princes: rams, lambs, male goats, and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
26Ezk 39:19 You will eat fat until you are satisfied and drink blood until you are drunk, at My sacrificial feast that I have prepared for you.
26Ezk 39:20 At My table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, of mighty men and all the warriors." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:21 "I will display My glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgment I have executed and the hand I have laid on them.
26Ezk 39:22 From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.
26Ezk 39:23 And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile on account of their iniquity, because they dealt unfaithfully with Me. Therefore, I hid My face from them and handed them over to their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.
26Ezk 39:24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions, and I hid My face from them.
26Ezk 39:25 "So this is what the Lord God says: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have compassion on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for My holy name.
26Ezk 39:26 They will feel remorse for their disgrace and all the unfaithfulness they committed against Me, when they live securely in their land with no one to frighten [them].
26Ezk 39:27 When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the countries of their enemies, I will demonstrate My holiness through them in the sight of many nations.
26Ezk 39:28 They will know that I am the LORD their God when I regather them to their own land after having exiled them among the nations. I will leave none of them behind.
26Ezk 39:29 I will no longer hide My face from them, for I will pour out My Spirit on the house of Israel." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been captured, on that very day the LORD's hand was on me, and He brought me there.
26Ezk 40:2 In visions of God He took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. On its southern [slope] was a structure resembling a city.
26Ezk 40:3 He brought me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. He was standing by the gate.
26Ezk 40:4 He spoke to me: "Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for you have been brought here so that I might show [it] to you. Report everything you see to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 40:5 Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. The measuring rod in the man's hand was six units of 21 inches; each unit was the standard length plus three inches. He measured the thickness of the [wall] structure; it was about 10 feet, and its height was the same.
26Ezk 40:6 Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate; it was 10 feet deep-- the first threshold was 10 feet deep.
26Ezk 40:7 Each recess was about 10 feet long and 10 feet deep, and there was [a space of] eight and three-quarter feet between the recesses. The [inner] threshold of the gate on the temple side next to the gate's portico was about 10 feet.
26Ezk 40:8 Next he measured the portico of the gate;
26Ezk 40:9 it was 14 feet, and its pilasters were three and a half feet. The portico of the gate was on the temple side.
26Ezk 40:10 There were three recesses on each side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the pilasters on either side also had the same measurements.
26Ezk 40:11 Then he measured the width of the gate's entrance; it was 17 and a half feet, while the width of the gateway was 22 and three-quarter feet.
26Ezk 40:12 There was a barrier of 21 inches in front of the recesses on both sides, and the recesses on each side were 10 and a half feet square.
26Ezk 40:13 Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one recess to the roof of the [opposite] one; the distance was 43 and three-quarter feet. The openings of the recesses faced each other.
26Ezk 40:14 Next, he measured the pilasters-- 105 feet. The gate extended around to the pilaster of the court.
26Ezk 40:15 [The distance] from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the gate's portico on the inside was 87 and a half feet.
26Ezk 40:16 The recesses and their pilasters had beveled windows all around the inside of the gateway. The porticos also had windows all around on the inside. Each pilaster was decorated with palm trees.
26Ezk 40:17 Then he brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a paved surface laid out all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement,
26Ezk 40:18 which flanked the gates and corresponded to the length of the gates; [this] was the lower pavement.
26Ezk 40:19 Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court; it was 175 feet. [This] was the east; next the north [is described].
26Ezk 40:20 He measured the gate of the outer court facing north, [both] its length and width.
26Ezk 40:21 Its three recesses on each side, its pilasters, and its portico had the same measurements as the first gate: 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.
26Ezk 40:22 Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate that faced east. Seven steps led up to the gate, and its portico was ahead of them.
26Ezk 40:23 The inner court had a gate facing the north gate, like the one on the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate; it was 175 feet.
26Ezk 40:24 He brought me to the south side, and there was also a gate on the south. He measured its pilasters and portico; they had the same measurements as the others.
26Ezk 40:25 Both the gate and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.
26Ezk 40:26 Its stairway had seven steps, and its portico was ahead of them. It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on each side.
26Ezk 40:27 The inner court had a gate on the south. He measured from gate to gate on the south; it was 175 feet.
26Ezk 40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements as the others.
26Ezk 40:29 Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.
26Ezk 40:30 (There were porticoes all around, 43 and three-quarter feet long and eight and three-quarter feet wide.)
26Ezk 40:31 Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees. Its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. When he measured the gate, it had the same measurements as the others.
26Ezk 40:33 Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.
26Ezk 40:34 Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:35 Then he brought me to the north gate. When he measured [it], it had the same measurements as the others,
26Ezk 40:36 [as did] its recesses, pilasters, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was 87 and a half feet long and 43 and three-quarter feet wide.
26Ezk 40:37 Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
26Ezk 40:38 There was a chamber whose door [opened] into the portico of the gate. The burnt offering was to be washed there.
26Ezk 40:39 Inside the portico of the gate there were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, sin offering, and restitution offering.
26Ezk 40:40 Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two [more] tables on the other side of the gate's portico.
26Ezk 40:41 So there were four tables inside the gate and four outside, eight tables [in all] on which the slaughtering was to be done.
26Ezk 40:42 There were also four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering, [each] 31 and a half inches long, 31 and a half inches wide, and 21 inches high. The utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and [other] sacrifices were placed on them.
26Ezk 40:43 There were three-inch hooks fastened all around the inside of the room, and the flesh of the offering was to be laid on the tables.
26Ezk 40:44 Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were chambers for the singers: one beside the north gate, facing south, and another beside the south gate, facing north.
26Ezk 40:45 Then the man said to me: "This chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple.
26Ezk 40:46 The chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the ones from the sons of Levi who may approach the LORD to serve Him."
26Ezk 40:47 Next he measured the court. It was square, 175 feet long and 175 feet wide. The altar was in front of the temple.
26Ezk 40:48 Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the pilasters of the portico; they were eight and three-quarter feet [thick] on each side. The width of the gateway was 24 and a half feet, and the sidewalls of the gate were five and a quarter feet [wide] on each side.
26Ezk 40:49 The portico was 35 feet across and 21 feet deep, and 10 steps led up to it. There were pillars by the pilasters, one on each side.
26Ezk 41:1 Next he brought me into the great hall and measured the pilasters; on each side the width of the pilaster was 10 and a half feet.
26Ezk 41:2 The width of the entrance was 17 and a half feet, and the sidewalls of the entrance were eight and three-quarter feet [wide] on each side. He also measured the length of the great hall, 70 feet, and the width, 35 feet.
26Ezk 41:3 He went inside [the next room] and measured the pilasters at the entrance; they were three and a half feet [wide]. The entrance was 10 and a half feet [wide], and the width of the entrance's sidewalls on each side was 12 and a quarter feet.
26Ezk 41:4 He then measured the length of the room adjacent to the great hall, 35 feet, and the width, 35 feet. And he said to me, "This is the most holy place."
26Ezk 41:5 Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was 10 and a half feet [thick]. The width of the side rooms all around the temple was seven feet.
26Ezk 41:6 The side rooms were arranged one above another in three stories of 30 rooms each. There were ledges on the wall of the temple all around to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports would not be in the temple wall [itself].
26Ezk 41:7 The side rooms surrounding [the temple] widened at each successive story, for the structure surrounding the temple [went up] by stages. This was the reason for the temple's broadness as it rose. And so, one would go up from the lowest story to the highest by means of the middle one.
26Ezk 41:8 I saw that the temple had a raised platform surrounding [it]; this foundation for the side rooms was 10 and a half feet high.
26Ezk 41:9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was eight and three-quarter feet. The free space between the side rooms of the temple
26Ezk 41:10 and the [outer] chambers was 35 feet wide all around the temple.
26Ezk 41:11 The side rooms opened into the free space, one entrance toward the north and another to the south. The area of free space was eight and three-quarter feet wide all around.
26Ezk 41:12 Now the building that faced the temple yard toward the west was 122 and a half feet wide. The wall of the building was eight and three-quarter feet thick on all sides, and the building's length was 157 and a half feet.
26Ezk 41:13 Then the man measured the temple; it was 175 feet long. In addition, the temple yard and the building, including its walls, were 175 feet long.
26Ezk 41:14 The width of the front of the temple along with the temple yard to the east was 175 feet.
26Ezk 41:15 Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple yard to the west, with its galleries on each side; it was 175 feet. The interior of the great hall and the porticoes of the court--
26Ezk 41:16 the thresholds, the beveled windows, and the balconies all around with their three levels opposite the threshold-- were overlaid with wood on all sides. [They were paneled] from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),
26Ezk 41:17 reaching to the top of the entrance, and as far as the inner temple and on the outside. On every wall all around, on the inside and outside, was a pattern
26Ezk 41:18 carved with cherubim and palm trees. There was a palm tree between each pair of cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:
26Ezk 41:19 a human face turned toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion's face turned toward it on the other. They were carved throughout the temple on all sides.
26Ezk 41:20 Cherubim and palm trees were carved from the ground to the top of the entrance and on the wall of the great hall.
26Ezk 41:21 The doorposts of the great hall were square, and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance.
26Ezk 41:22 The altar was made of wood, five and a quarter feet high and three and a half feet long. It had corners, and its length and sides were of wood. The man told me, "This is the table that stands before the LORD."
26Ezk 41:23 The great hall and the sanctuary each had a double door,
26Ezk 41:24 and each of the doors had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other.
26Ezk 41:25 Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the great hall like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden canopyoutside, in front of the portico.
26Ezk 41:26 There were beveled windows and palm trees on both sides, on the sidewalls of the portico, the side rooms of the temple, and the canopies.
26Ezk 42:1 Then the man led me out by way of the north gate into the outer court. He brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple yard and opposite the building to the north.
26Ezk 42:2 Along the length [of the chambers], which was 175 feet, there was an entrance on the north; the width was 87 and a half feet.
26Ezk 42:3 Opposite the 35 [foot space] belonging to the inner court and opposite the paved surface belonging to the outer court, [the structure rose] gallery by gallery in three tiers.
26Ezk 42:4 In front of the chambers was a walkway toward the inside, 17 and a half feet wide and 175 feet long, and their entrances were on the north.
26Ezk 42:5 The upper chambers were narrower because the galleries took away more space from them than from the lower and middle stories of the building.
26Ezk 42:6 For they were arranged in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and middle stories.
26Ezk 42:7 A wall on the outside ran in front of the chambers, parallel to them, toward the outer court; it was 87 and a half feet long.
26Ezk 42:8 For the chambers on the outer court were 87 and a half feet long, while those facing the great hall were 175 feet [long].
26Ezk 42:9 At the base of these chambers there was an entryway on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
26Ezk 42:10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the south, there were chambers facing the temple yard and the [western] building,
26Ezk 42:11 with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that faced north. Their length and width, as well as all their exits, measurements, and entrances, were identical.
26Ezk 42:12 The entrance at the beginning of the passageway, the way in front of the corresponding wall as one enters on the east side, was similar to the entrances of the chambers that were on the south side.
26Ezk 42:13 Then the man said to me, "The northern and southern chambers that face the temple yard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will deposit the most holy offerings-- the grain offerings, sin offerings, and restitution offerings-- for the place is holy.
26Ezk 42:14 Once the priests have entered, they must not go out from the holy area to the outer court until they have removed the clothes they minister in, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the public area."
26Ezk 42:15 When he finished measuring inside the temple complex, he led me out by way of the gate that faced east and measured all around the complex.
26Ezk 42:16 He measured the east side with a measuring rod; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
26Ezk 42:17 He measured the north side; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
26Ezk 42:18 He measured the south side; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
26Ezk 42:19 Then he turned to the west side and measured 875 feet by the measuring rod.
26Ezk 42:20 He measured the temple complex on all four sides. It had a wall all around [it], 875 [feet] long and 875 [feet] wide, to separate the holy from the common.
26Ezk 43:1 He led me to the gate, the one that faces east,
26Ezk 43:2 and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice sounded like the roar of mighty waters, and the earth shone with His glory.
26Ezk 43:3 The vision I saw was like the one I had seen when He came to destroy the city, and like the ones I had seen by the Chebar Canal. I fell facedown.
26Ezk 43:4 The glory of the LORD entered the temple by way of the gate that faced east.
26Ezk 43:5 Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
26Ezk 43:6 While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from the temple.
26Ezk 43:7 He said to me: "Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. [The house of] Israel and their kings will no longer defile My holy name by their [religious] prostitution and by the corpses of their kings at their high places.
26Ezk 43:8 Whenever they placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts beside My doorposts, with [only] a wall between Me and them, they were defiling My holy name by the abominations they committed. So I destroyed them in My anger.
26Ezk 43:9 Now let them remove their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell among them forever.
26Ezk 43:10 "As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure [its] pattern,
26Ezk 43:11 and they will be ashamed of all that they have done. Reveal the design of the temple to them-- its layout with its exits and entrances-- its complete design along with all its statutes, design specifications, and laws. Write it down in their sight so that they may observe its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out.
26Ezk 43:12 This is the law of the temple: all its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be especially holy. Yes, this is the law of the temple.
26Ezk 43:13 "These are the measurements of the altar in units of length (each unit being the standard length plus three inches): the gutter is 21 inches [deep] and 21 inches wide, with a rim of nine inches around its edge. This is the base of the altar.
26Ezk 43:14 [The distance] from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge is three and a half feet, and the width [of the ledge] is 21 inches. There are seven feet from the small ledge to the large ledge, [whose] width is also 21 inches.
26Ezk 43:15 The altar hearth is seven feet [high], and four horns project upward from the hearth.
26Ezk 43:16 The hearth is square, 21 feet long by 21 feet wide.
26Ezk 43:17 The ledge is 24 and a half feet long by 24 and a half feet wide, with four equal sides. The rim all around it is 10 and a half inches, and its gutter is 21 inches all around it. The altar's steps face east."
26Ezk 43:18 Then He said to me: "Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it and blood may be sprinkled on it:
26Ezk 43:19 You are to give a bull from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who approach Me in order to serve Me." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 43:20 "You must take some of its blood and apply [it] to the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim. In this way you will purify the altar and make atonement for it.
26Ezk 43:21 Then you must take away the bull for the sin offering, and it must be burned outside the sanctuary in the place appointed for the temple.
26Ezk 43:22 "On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering. They will purify the altar just as they did with the bull.
26Ezk 43:23 When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock.
26Ezk 43:24 You must present them before the LORD; the priests will throw salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.
26Ezk 43:25 You will offer a goat for a sin offering each day for seven days. A young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished, must also be offered.
26Ezk 43:26 For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it. In this way they will consecrate it
26Ezk 43:27 and complete the days [of purification]. Then on the eighth day and afterwards, the priests will offer your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar, and I will accept you." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 44:1 The man then brought me back toward the sanctuary's outer gate that faced east, and it was closed.
26Ezk 44:2 The LORD said to me: "This gate will remain closed. It will not be opened, and no one will enter through it, because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will remain closed.
26Ezk 44:3 The prince himself will sit in the gateway to eat a meal before the LORD. He must enter by way of the portico of the gate and go out the same way."
26Ezk 44:4 Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked, and the glory of the LORD filled His temple. And I fell facedown.
26Ezk 44:5 The LORD said to me: "Son of man, pay attention; look with your eyes and listen with your ears to everything I tell you about all the statutes and laws of the LORD's temple. Take careful note of the entrance of the temple along with all the exits of the sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:6 "Say to the rebellious people, the house of Israel: This is what the Lord God says: [I have had] enough of all your abominations, house of Israel.
26Ezk 44:7 When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in both heart and flesh, to occupy My sanctuary, you defiled My temple while you offered My food-- the fat and the blood. You broke My covenant with all your abominations.
26Ezk 44:8 You have not kept charge of My holy things but have appointed [others] to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.
26Ezk 44:9 "This is what the Lord God says: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, may enter My sanctuary, not even a foreigner who is among the Israelites.
26Ezk 44:10 Surely the Levites who wandered away from Me when Israel went astray, and who strayed from Me after their idols, will bear the consequences of their sin.
26Ezk 44:11 Yet they will occupy My sanctuary, serving as guards at the temple gates and ministering at the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and [other] sacrifices for the people and will stand before them to serve them.
26Ezk 44:12 Because they ministered to the house of Israel before their idols and became a sinful stumbling block to them, therefore I swore an oath against them"-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- "that they would bear the consequences of their sin.
26Ezk 44:13 They must not approach Me to serve Me as priests or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things. They will bear their disgrace and the consequences of the abominations they committed.
26Ezk 44:14 Yet I will make them responsible for the duties of the temple-- for all its work and everything done in it.
26Ezk 44:15 "But the Levitical priests descended from Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from Me, will approach Me to serve Me. They will stand before Me to offer Me fat and blood." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 44:16 "They are the ones who may enter My sanctuary and draw near to My table to serve Me. They will keep My mandate.
26Ezk 44:17 When they enter the gates of the inner court they must wear linen garments; they must not have on them anything made of wool when they minister at the gates of the inner court and within [it].
26Ezk 44:18 They must wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They are not to put on [anything that makes them] sweat.
26Ezk 44:19 Before they go out to the outer court, to the people, they must take off the clothes they have been ministering in, leave them in the holy chambers, and dress in other clothes so that they do not transmit holiness to the people through their clothes.
26Ezk 44:20 "They may not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but must carefully trim their hair.
26Ezk 44:21 No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court.
26Ezk 44:22 He is not to marry a widow or a divorced woman, but must marry a virgin from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
26Ezk 44:23 They must teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and explain to them the difference between the clean and the unclean.
26Ezk 44:24 "In a dispute, they will officiate as judges and decide the case according to My ordinances. They must observe My laws and statutes regarding all My appointed festivals, and keep My Sabbaths holy.
26Ezk 44:25 A priest may not come [near] a dead person so that he becomes defiled. However, he may defile himself for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister.
26Ezk 44:26 After he is cleansed, he is to count off seven days for himself.
26Ezk 44:27 On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 44:28 "This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance. You are to give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
26Ezk 44:29 They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the restitution offering. Everything in Israel that is permanently dedicated [to the LORD] will belong to them.
26Ezk 44:30 The best of all the firstfruits of every kind and contribution of every kind from all your gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give your first batch of dough to the priest so that a blessing may rest on your homes.
26Ezk 44:31 The priests may not eat any bird or animal that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts.
26Ezk 45:1 "When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance, you must set aside a donation to the LORD, a holy portion of the land, eight and one-third [miles] long and six and two-thirds [miles] wide. This entire tract of land will be holy.
26Ezk 45:2 In this area there will be a square [section] for the sanctuary, 875 by 875 [feet], with 87 and a half feet of open space all around it.
26Ezk 45:3 From this holy portion, you will measure off an area eight and one-third [miles] long and three and one-third [miles] wide, in which the sanctuary, the most holy place, will stand.
26Ezk 45:4 It will be a holy area of the land to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who draw near to serve the LORD. It will be a place for their houses, as well as a holy area for the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:5 There will be [another area] eight and one-third [miles] long and three and one-third [miles] wide for the Levites who minister in the temple; it will be their possession for towns to live in.
26Ezk 45:6 "As the property of the city, you must set aside an area one and two-thirds [of a mile] wide and eight and one-third [miles] long, adjacent to the holy donation [of land]. It will be for the whole house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:7 And the prince will have the area on each side of the holy donation [of land] and the city's property, adjacent to the holy donation and the city's property, stretching to the west on the west side and to the east on the east side. [Its] length will correspond to one of the [tribal] portions from the western boundary to the eastern boundary.
26Ezk 45:8 This will be his land as a possession in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress My people but give the [rest of the] land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
26Ezk 45:9 "This is what the Lord God says: You have gone too far, princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Put an end to your evictions of My people." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 45:10 "You must have honest balances, an honest dry measure, and an honest liquid measure.
26Ezk 45:11 The dry measure and the liquid measure will be uniform, with the liquid measure containing five and a half gallons and the dry measure [holding] half a bushel. Their measurement will be one-tenth of the standard larger capacity measure.
26Ezk 45:12 The shekel will weigh 20 gerahs. Your mina will equal 60 shekels.
26Ezk 45:13 "This is the contribution you are to offer: Three quarts from five bushels of wheat and three quarts from five bushels of barley.
26Ezk 45:14 The quota of oil in liquid measures will be one percent of every cor. [The cor equals] 10 liquid measures [or] one standard larger capacity measure, since 10 liquid measures equal one standard larger capacity measure.
26Ezk 45:15 And [the quota] from the flock is one animal out of every 200 from the well-watered pastures of Israel. [These are] for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings, to make atonement for the people." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 45:16 "All the people of the land must take part in this contribution for the prince in Israel.
26Ezk 45:17 Then the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths-- for all the appointed times of the house of Israel-- will be the prince's responsibility. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings to make atonement on behalf of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 45:18 "This is what the Lord God says: In the first [month], on the first [day] of the month, you are to take a young, unblemished bull and purify the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:19 The priest must take some of the blood from the sin offering and apply [it] to the temple doorposts, the four corners of the altar's ledge, and the doorposts of the gate to the inner court.
26Ezk 45:20 You must do the same thing on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. In this way you will make atonement for the temple.
26Ezk 45:21 "In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, you are to celebrate the Passover, a festival of seven days [during which] unleavened bread will be eaten.
26Ezk 45:22 On that day the prince will provide a bull as a sin offering on behalf of himself and all the people of the land.
26Ezk 45:23 During the seven days of the festival, he will provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD on each of the seven days, along with a male goat each day for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:24 He will also provide a grain offering of half a bushel per bull and half a bushel per ram, along with a gallon of oil for every half bushel.
26Ezk 45:25 At the festival [that begins] on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he will provide the same things for seven days-- the same sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.
26Ezk 46:1 "This is what the Lord God says: The gate of the inner court that faces east must be closed during the six days of work, but it will be opened on the Sabbath day and opened on the day of the New Moon.
26Ezk 46:2 The prince should enter from the outside by way of the gate's portico and stand at the doorpost of the gate while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He will bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then depart, but the gate must not be closed until evening.
26Ezk 46:3 The people of the land will also bow in worship before the LORD at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and New Moons.
26Ezk 46:4 "The burnt offering that the prince presents to the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram.
26Ezk 46:5 The grain offering will be half a bushel with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs will be whatever he wants to give, as well as a gallon of oil for every half bushel.
26Ezk 46:6 On the day of the New Moon, [the burnt offering] is to be a young, unblemished bull, as well as six lambs and a ram without blemish.
26Ezk 46:7 He will provide a grain offering of half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he can afford with the lambs, together with a gallon of oil for every half bushel.
26Ezk 46:8 When the prince enters, he must go in by way of the gate's portico and go out the same way.
26Ezk 46:9 "When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed times, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship must go out by way of the south gate, and whoever enters by way of the south gate must go out by way of the north gate. No one must return through the gate by which he entered, but must go out by the opposite gate.
26Ezk 46:10 When the people enter, the prince will enter with them, and when they leave, he will leave.
26Ezk 46:11 At the festivals and appointed times, the grain offering will be half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he wants to give with the lambs, along with a gallon of oil for every half bushel.
26Ezk 46:12 "When the prince makes a freewill offering, whether a burnt offering or a fellowship offering as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate that faces east must be opened for him. He is to offer his burnt offering or fellowship offering just as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he will go out, and the gate must be closed after he leaves.
26Ezk 46:13 "You must offer an unblemished year-old male lamb as a daily burnt offering to the LORD; you will offer it every morning.
26Ezk 46:14 You must also prepare a grain offering every morning along with it: three quarts, with one-third of a gallon of oil to moisten the fine flour-- a grain offering to the LORD. [This is] a permanent statute [to be observed] regularly.
26Ezk 46:15 They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.
26Ezk 46:16 "This is what the Lord God says: If the prince gives a gift to each of his sons as their inheritance, it will belong to his sons. It will become their property by inheritance.
26Ezk 46:17 But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom, when it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs only to his sons; it is theirs.
26Ezk 46:18 The prince must not take any of the people's inheritance, evicting them from their property. He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people will be displaced from his own property."
26Ezk 46:19 Then he brought me through the entrance that was at the side of the gate, into the priests' holy chambers, which faced north. I saw a place there at the far western end.
26Ezk 46:20 He said to me, "This is the place where the priests will boil the restitution offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring [them] into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people."
26Ezk 46:21 Next he brought me into the outer court and led me past its four corners. There was a [separate] court in each of its corners.
26Ezk 46:22 In the four corners of the [outer] court there were enclosed courts, 70 [feet] long by 52 and a half [feet] wide. All four corner areas had the same dimensions.
26Ezk 46:23 There was a [stone] wall around the inside of them, around the four of them, with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides.
26Ezk 46:24 He said to me: "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the people's sacrifices."
26Ezk 47:1 Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple and there was water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the south side [of the threshold] of the temple, south of the altar.
26Ezk 47:2 Next he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faced east; there the water was trickling from the south side.
26Ezk 47:3 As the man went out east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to [my] ankles.
26Ezk 47:4 Then he measured off a third [of a mile] and led me through the water. It came up to [my] knees. He measured off another third [of a mile] and led me through [the water]. It came up to [my] waist.
26Ezk 47:5 Again he measured off a third of a [mile], and it was a river that I could not cross [on foot]. For the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed [on foot].
26Ezk 47:6 He asked me, "Do you see [this], son of man?" Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
26Ezk 47:7 When I had returned, I saw a very large number of trees along both sides of the riverbank.
26Ezk 47:8 He said to me, "This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down to the Arabah. When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water, the water [of the sea] becomes fresh.
26Ezk 47:9 Every [kind of] living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows, and there will be a huge number of fish because this water goes there. Since the water will become fresh, there will be life everywhere the river goes.
26Ezk 47:10 Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedi to En-eglaim. These will become places where nets are spread out to dry. Their fish will consist of many different kinds, like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea.
26Ezk 47:11 Yet its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be left for salt.
26Ezk 47:12 All [kinds of] trees providing food will grow along both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because the water [comes] from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be used for food and their leaves for medicine."
26Ezk 47:13 This is what the Lord God says: "This is the border you will [use to] divide the land as an inheritance for the 12 tribes of Israel. Joseph will receive two shares.
26Ezk 47:14 You will inherit it in equal portions, since I swore to give it to your ancestors. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance.
26Ezk 47:15 "This is to be the border of the land: On the north side it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea by way of Hethlon and Lebo-hamath to Zedad,
26Ezk 47:16 Berothah, and Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), [as far as] Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26Ezk 47:17 So the border will run from the sea to Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side.
26Ezk 47:18 On the east side it will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; you will measure from the [northern] border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side.
26Ezk 47:19 On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and on to the Brook [of Egypt] as far as the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern side.
26Ezk 47:20 On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border, from the [southern] border up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western side.
26Ezk 47:21 "You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:22 You will allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners living among you, who have fathered children among you. You will treat them like native-born Israelites; along with you, they will be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:23 In whatever tribe the foreigner lives, you will assign his inheritance there." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 48:1 "Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern end, along the road of Hethlon, to Lebo-hamath as far as Hazar-enon, at the northern border of Damascus, alongside Hamath and extending from the eastern side to the sea, will be Dan-- one portion.
26Ezk 48:2 Next to the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, will be Asher-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:3 Next to the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, will be Naphtali-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:4 Next to the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, will be Manasseh-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:5 Next to the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, will be Ephraim-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:6 Next to the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, will be Reuben-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:7 Next to the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, will be Judah-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:8 "Next to the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, will be the portion you donate [to the LORD], eight and one-third [miles] wide, and as long as one of the [tribal] portions from the east side to the west. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:9 "The [special] portion you donate to the LORD will be eight and one-third [miles] long and three and one-third [miles] wide.
26Ezk 48:10 This holy donation will be set apart for the priests [alone]. It will be eight and one-third [miles long] on the northern side, three and one-third [miles] wide on the western side, three and one-third [miles] wide on the eastern side, and eight and one-third [miles] long on the southern side. The LORD's sanctuary will be in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:11 It is for the consecrated priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept My charge and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray.
26Ezk 48:12 It will be a special donation for them out of the [holy] donation of the land, a most holy place adjacent to the territory of the Levites.
26Ezk 48:13 "Next to the territory of the priests, the Levites [will have an area] eight and one-third [miles] long and three and one-third [miles] wide. The total length will be eight and one-third [miles] and the width three and one-third [miles].
26Ezk 48:14 They must not sell or exchange any of it, and they must not transfer this choice [part] of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.
26Ezk 48:15 "The remaining [area], one and two-thirds [of a mile] wide and eight and one-third [miles long], will be for common use by the city, for [both] residential and open space. The city will be in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:16 These are the city's measurements: one and a half [miles] on the north side; one and a half [miles] on the south side; one and a half [miles] on the east side; and one and a half [miles] on the west side.
26Ezk 48:17 The city's open space will extend: 425 [feet] to the north, 425 [feet] to the south, 425 [feet] to the east, and 425 [feet] to the west.
26Ezk 48:18 "The remainder of the length alongside the holy donation will be three and one-third [miles] to the east and three and one-third [miles] to the west. It will run alongside the holy donation. Its produce will be food for the workers of the city.
26Ezk 48:19 The city's workers from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it.
26Ezk 48:20 The entire donation will be eight and one-third [miles] by eight and one-third [miles]; you are to set apart the holy donation along with the city property as a square [area].
26Ezk 48:21 "The remaining [area] on both sides of the holy donation and the city property will belong to the prince. He will own [the land] adjacent to the [tribal] portions, next to the eight and one-third [miles] of the donation as far as the eastern border and next to the eight and one-third [miles of the donation] as far as the western border. The holy donation and the sanctuary of the temple will be in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:22 Except for the Levitical property and the city property in the middle of the area belonging to the prince, the area between the territory of Judah and that of Benjamin will belong to the prince.
26Ezk 48:23 "As for the rest of the tribes: From the east side to the west, will be Benjamin-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:24 Next to the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, will be Simeon-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:25 Next to the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, will be Issachar-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:26 Next to the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, will be Zebulun-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:27 Next to the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, will be Gad-- one [portion].
26Ezk 48:28 Next to the territory of Gad toward the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook [of Egypt], and out to the Mediterranean Sea.
26Ezk 48:29 This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to Israel's tribes, and these will be their portions." [This is] the declaration of the Lord God.
26Ezk 48:30 "These are the exits of the city: On the north side, which measures one and a half [miles],
26Ezk 48:31 there will be three gates facing north, the gates of the city being named for the tribes of Israel: one, the gate of Reuben; one, the gate of Judah; and one, the gate of Levi.
26Ezk 48:32 On the east side, which is one and a half [miles], there will be three gates: one, the gate of Joseph; one, the gate of Benjamin; and one, the gate of Dan.
26Ezk 48:33 On the south side, which measures one and a half [miles], there will be three gates: one, the gate of Simeon; one, the gate of Issachar; and one, the gate of Zebulun.
26Ezk 48:34 On the west side, which is one and a half [miles], there will be three gates: one, the gate of Gad; one, the gate of Asher; and one, the gate of Naphtali.
26Ezk 48:35 The perimeter [of the city] will be six [miles], and the name of the city from that day on will be: Yahweh Is There."

27Dn 1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
27Dn 1:2 The Lord handed Jehoiakim king of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them to the land of Babylon, to the house of his god, and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.
27Dn 1:3 The king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and from the nobility--
27Dn 1:4 young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom, knowledgeable, perceptive, and capable of serving in the king's palace-- and to teach them the Chaldean language and literature.
27Dn 1:5 The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to serve in the king's court.
27Dn 1:6 Among them, from the descendants of Judah, were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
27Dn 1:7 The chief official gave them [different] names: to Daniel, he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
27Dn 1:8 Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king's food or with the wine he drank. So he asked permission from the chief official not to defile himself.
27Dn 1:9 God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official,
27Dn 1:10 yet he said to Daniel, "My lord the king assigned your food and drink. I'm afraid [of what would happen] if he saw your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age. You would endanger my life with the king."
27Dn 1:11 So Daniel said to the guard whom the chief official had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
27Dn 1:12 "Please test your servants for 10 days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27Dn 1:13 Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king's food, and deal with your servants based on what you see."
27Dn 1:14 He agreed with them in this matter and tested them for 10 days.
27Dn 1:15 At the end of 10 days they looked better and healthier than all the young men who were eating the king's food.
27Dn 1:16 So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.
27Dn 1:17 God gave these four young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams of every kind.
27Dn 1:18 At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 1:19 The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve in the king's court.
27Dn 1:20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them 10 times better than all the diviner-priests and mediums in his entire kingdom.
27Dn 1:21 Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
27Dn 2:1 In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled him, and sleep deserted him.
27Dn 2:2 So the king gave orders to summon the diviner-priests, mediums, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king,
27Dn 2:3 he said to them, "I have had a dream and am anxious to understand it."
27Dn 2:4 The Chaldeans spoke to the king (Aramaic begins here): "May the king live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation."
27Dn 2:5 The king replied to the Chaldeans, "My word is final: If you don't tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump.
27Dn 2:6 But if you make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you'll receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me. So make the dream and its interpretation known to me."
27Dn 2:7 They answered a second time, "May the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will give the interpretation."
27Dn 2:8 The king replied, "I know for certain you are trying to gain some time, because you see that my word is final.
27Dn 2:9 If you don't tell me the dream, there is one decree for you. You have conspired to tell me something false or fraudulent until the situation changes. So tell me the dream and I will know you can give me its interpretation."
27Dn 2:10 The Chaldeans answered the king, "No one on earth can make known what the king requests. Consequently, no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any diviner-priest, medium, or Chaldean.
27Dn 2:11 What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals."
27Dn 2:12 Because of this, the king became violently angry and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:13 The decree was issued that the wise men were to be executed, and they searched for Daniel and his friends, to execute them.
27Dn 2:14 Then Daniel responded with tact and discretion to Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:15 He asked Arioch, the king's officer, "Why is the decree from the king so harsh?" Then Arioch explained the situation to Daniel.
27Dn 2:16 So Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give the king the interpretation.
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter,
27Dn 2:18 [urging] them to ask the God of heaven for mercy concerning this mystery, so Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of Babylon's wise men.
27Dn 2:19 The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of heaven
27Dn 2:20 and declared: May the name of God be praised forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.
27Dn 2:21 He changes the times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.
27Dn 2:22 He reveals the deep and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with Him.
27Dn 2:23 I offer thanks and praise to You, God of my fathers, because You have given me wisdom and power. And now You have let me know what we asked of You, for You have let us know the king's mystery.
27Dn 2:24 Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had assigned to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He came and said to him, "Don't kill the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation."
27Dn 2:25 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, "I have found a man among the Judean exiles who can let the king know the interpretation."
27Dn 2:26 The king said in reply to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to tell me the dream I had and its interpretation?"
27Dn 2:27 Daniel answered the king: "No wise man, medium, diviner-priest, or astrologer is able to make known to the king the mystery he asked about.
27Dn 2:28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will happen in the last days. Your dream and the visions [that came into] your mind [as you lay] in bed were these:
27Dn 2:29 Your Majesty, while you were in your bed, thoughts came [to your mind] about what will happen in the future. The revealer of mysteries has let you know what will happen.
27Dn 2:30 As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
27Dn 2:31 "My king, as you were watching, a colossal statue appeared. That statue, tall and dazzling, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying.
27Dn 2:32 The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze,
27Dn 2:33 its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay.
27Dn 2:34 As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it, struck the statue on its feet of iron and fired clay, and crushed them.
27Dn 2:35 Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
27Dn 2:36 "This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.
27Dn 2:37 Your Majesty, you are king of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory.
27Dn 2:38 Wherever people live-- or wild animals, or birds of the air-- He has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.
27Dn 2:39 "After you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth.
27Dn 2:40 A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; for iron crushes and shatters everything, and like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all the others.
27Dn 2:41 You saw the feet and toes, partly of a potter's fired clay and partly of iron-- it will be a divided kingdom, though some of the strength of iron will be in it. You saw the iron mixed with clay,
27Dn 2:42 and that the toes of the feet were part iron and part fired clay-- part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle.
27Dn 2:43 You saw the iron mixed with clay-- the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay.
27Dn 2:44 "In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever.
27Dn 2:45 You saw a stone break off from the mountain without a hand touching it, and it crushed the iron, bronze, fired clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation certain."
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell down, paid homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present an offering and incense to him.
27Dn 2:47 The king said to Daniel, "Your God is indeed God of gods, Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, since you were able to reveal this mystery."
27Dn 2:48 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
27Dn 2:49 At Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court.
27Dn 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue, 90 feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 3:2 King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:3 So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:4 A herald loudly proclaimed, "People of every nation and language, you are commanded:
27Dn 3:5 When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
27Dn 3:6 But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire."
27Dn 3:7 Therefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:8 Some Chaldeans took this occasion to come forward and maliciously accusethe Jews.
27Dn 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May the king live forever.
27Dn 3:10 You as king have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music must fall down and worship the gold statue.
27Dn 3:11 Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:12 There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men have ignored you, the king; they do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."
27Dn 3:13 Then in a furious rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king.
27Dn 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don't serve my gods or worship the gold statue I have set up?
27Dn 3:15 Now if you're ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don't worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire-- and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?"
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, "Nebuchadnezzar, we don't need to give you an answer to this question.
27Dn 3:17 If the God we serve exists, then He can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and He can rescue us from the power of you, the king.
27Dn 3:18 But even if He does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up."
27Dn 3:19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than was customary,
27Dn 3:20 and he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:21 So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings, and other clothes, were tied up and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:22 Since the king's command was so urgent and the furnace extremely hot, the raging flames killed those men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego up.
27Dn 3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.
27Dn 3:24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm. He said to his advisers, "Didn't we throw three men, bound, into the fire?" "Yes, of course, Your Majesty," they replied to the king.
27Dn 3:25 He exclaimed, "Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods."
27Dn 3:26 Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called: "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God-- come out!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.
27Dn 3:27 When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king's advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men: not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them.
27Dn 3:28 Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, "Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent His angel and rescued His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king's command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
27Dn 3:29 Therefore I issue a decree that anyone of any people, nation, or language who says anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb and his house made a garbage dump. For there is no other god who is able to deliver like this."
27Dn 3:30 Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 4:1  King Nebuchadnezzar, To those of every people, nation, and language, who live in all the earth: May your prosperity increase.
27Dn 4:2 I am pleased to tell you about the miracles and wonders the Most High God has done for me.
27Dn 4:3 How great are His miracles, and how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:4  I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
27Dn 4:5 I had a dream, and it frightened me; while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.
27Dn 4:6 So I issued a decree to bring all the wise men of Babylon to me in order that they might make the dream's interpretation known to me.
27Dn 4:7 When the diviner-priests, mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers came in, I told them the dream, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
27Dn 4:8 Finally Daniel, named Belteshazzar after the name of my god-- and the spirit of the holy gods is in him-- came before me. I told him the dream:
27Dn 4:9 Belteshazzar, head of the diviners, because I know that you have a spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery puzzles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation.
27Dn 4:10 In the visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this: There was a tree in the middle of the earth, and its height was great.
27Dn 4:11 The tree grew large and strong; its top reached to the sky, and it was visible to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:12 Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant, and on it was food for all. Wild animals found shelter under it, the birds of the air lived in its branches, and every creature was fed from it.
27Dn 4:13 As I was lying in my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind an observer, a holy one, coming down from heaven.
27Dn 4:14 He called out loudly: Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
27Dn 4:15 But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and with a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky and share the plants of the earth with the animals.
27Dn 4:16 Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the mind of an animal for seven periods of time.
27Dn 4:17 This word is by decree of the observers; the matter is a command from the holy ones. This is so the living will know that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men. He gives it to anyone He wants and sets over it the lowliest of men.
27Dn 4:18 This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can make the interpretation known to me. But you can, because you have the spirit of the holy gods.
27Dn 4:19 Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, "Belteshazzar, don't let the dream or its interpretation alarm you." Belteshazzar answered, "My lord, may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!
27Dn 4:20 The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth,
27Dn 4:21 whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant-- and on it was food for all, under it the wild animals lived, and in its branches the birds of the air lived--
27Dn 4:22 that tree is you, the king. For you have become great and strong: your greatness has grown and even reaches the sky, and your dominion [extends] to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:23 "The king saw an observer, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky, and share [food] with the wild animals for seven periods of time.'
27Dn 4:24 This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the sentence of the Most High that has been passed against my lord the king:
27Dn 4:25 You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like cattle and be drenched with dew from the sky for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and He gives it to anyone He wants.
27Dn 4:26 As for the command to leave the tree's stump with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
27Dn 4:27 Therefore, may my advice seem good to you my king. Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right, and from your injustices by showing mercy to the needy. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity."
27Dn 4:28 All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 4:29 At the end of 12 months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon,
27Dn 4:30 the king exclaimed, "Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built by my vast power to be a royal residence and to display my majestic glory?"
27Dn 4:31 While the words were still in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven: "King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you.
27Dn 4:32 You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and He gives it to anyone He wants."
27Dn 4:33 At that moment the sentence against Nebuchadnezzar was executed. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles' [feathers] and his nails like birds' [claws].
27Dn 4:34 But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified Him who lives forever: For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:35 All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing, and He does what He wants with the army of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. There is no one who can hold back His hand or say to Him, "What have You done?"
27Dn 4:36 At that time my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and my nobles sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and even more greatness came to me.
27Dn 4:37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of heaven, because all His works are true and His ways are just. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.
27Dn 5:1 King Belshazzar held a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles and drank wine in their presence.
27Dn 5:2 Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines could drink from them.
27Dn 5:3 So they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines drank from them.
27Dn 5:4 They drank the wine and praised their gods made of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27Dn 5:5 At that moment the fingers of a man's hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the king's palace wall next to the lampstand. As the king watched the hand that was writing,
27Dn 5:6 his face turned pale, and his thoughts so terrified him that his hip joints shook and his knees knocked together.
27Dn 5:7 The king called out to bring in the mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers. He said to these wise men of Babylon, "Whoever reads this inscription and gives me its interpretation will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around his neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:8 So all the king's wise men came in, but none could read the inscription or make known its interpretation to him.
27Dn 5:9 Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face turned pale, and his nobles were bewildered.
27Dn 5:10 Because of the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen came to the banquet hall. "May the king live forever," she said. "Don't let your thoughts terrify you or your face be pale.
27Dn 5:11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your predecessor he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. Your predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the diviners, mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers. Your own predecessor, the king,
27Dn 5:12 [did this] because Daniel, the one the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and perception, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems. Therefore, summon Daniel, and he will give the interpretation."
27Dn 5:13 Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him, "Are you Daniel, one of the Judean exiles that my predecessor the king brought from Judah?
27Dn 5:14 I've heard that you have the spirit of the gods in you, and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom.
27Dn 5:15 Now the wise men and mediums were brought before me to read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not give its interpretation.
27Dn 5:16 However, I have heard about you that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around your neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:17 Then Daniel answered the king, "You may keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription for the king and make the interpretation known to him.
27Dn 5:18 Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, greatness, glory, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 5:19 Because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages were terrified and fearful of him. He killed anyone he wanted and kept alive anyone he wanted; he exalted anyone he wanted and humbled anyone he wanted.
27Dn 5:20 But when his heart was exalted and his spirit became arrogant, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken from him.
27Dn 5:21 He was driven away from people, his mind was like an animal's, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky until he acknowledged that the Most High God is ruler over the kingdom of men and sets anyone He wants over it.
27Dn 5:22 "But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this.
27Dn 5:23 Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels from His house were brought to you, and as you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them, you praised the gods made of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or understand. But you have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in His hand and who controls the whole course of your life.
27Dn 5:24 Therefore, He sent the hand, and this writing was inscribed.
27Dn 5:25 "This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN
27Dn 5:26 This is the interpretation of the message: MENE [means that] God has numbered [the days of] your kingdom and brought it to an end.
27Dn 5:27 TEKEL [means that] you have been weighed in the balance and found deficient.
27Dn 5:28 PERES [means that] your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians."
27Dn 5:29 Then Belshazzar gave an order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, [placed] a gold chain around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
27Dn 5:30 That very night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed,
27Dn 5:31  and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of 62.
27Dn 6:1 Darius decided to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, stationed throughout the realm,
27Dn 6:2 and over them three administrators, including Daniel. These satraps would be accountable to them so that the king would not be defrauded.
27Dn 6:3 Daniel distinguished himself above the administrators and satraps because he had an extraordinary spirit, so the king planned to set him over the whole realm.
27Dn 6:4 The administrators and satraps, therefore, kept trying to find a charge against Daniel regarding the kingdom. But they could find no charge or corruption, for he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him.
27Dn 6:5 Then these men said, "We will never find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God."
27Dn 6:6 So the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said to him, "May King Darius live forever.
27Dn 6:7 All the administrators of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an edict that for 30 days, anyone who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions' den.
27Dn 6:8 Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict and sign the document so that, as a law of the Medes and Persians, it is irrevocable and cannot be changed."
27Dn 6:9 So King Darius signed the document.
27Dn 6:10 When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before.
27Dn 6:11 Then these men went as a group and found Daniel petitioning and imploring his God.
27Dn 6:12 So they approached the king and asked about his edict: "Didn't you sign an edict that for 30 days any man who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions' den?" The king answered, "As a law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands and is irrevocable."
27Dn 6:13 Then they replied to the king, "Daniel, one of the Judean exiles, has ignored you, the king, and the edict you signed, for he prays three times a day."
27Dn 6:14 As soon as the king heard this, he was very displeased; he set his mind on rescuing Daniel and made every effort until sundown to deliver him.
27Dn 6:15 Then these men went to the king and said to him, "You as king know it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or ordinance the king establishes can be changed."
27Dn 6:16 So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions' den. The king said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!"
27Dn 6:17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing in regard to Daniel could be changed.
27Dn 6:18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No diversions were brought to him, and he could not sleep.
27Dn 6:19 At the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions' den.
27Dn 6:20 When he reached the den, he cried out in anguish to Daniel. "Daniel, servant of the living God," the king said, "has your God whom you serve continually been able to rescue you from the lions?"
27Dn 6:21 Then Daniel spoke with the king: "May the king live forever.
27Dn 6:22 My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths. They haven't hurt me, for I was found innocent before Him. Also, I have not committed a crime against you my king."
27Dn 6:23 The king was overjoyed and gave orders to take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, uninjured, for he trusted in his God.
27Dn 6:24 The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions' den-- they, their children, and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
27Dn 6:25 Then King Darius wrote to those of every people, nation, and language who live in all the earth: "May your prosperity abound.
27Dn 6:26 I issue a decree that in all my royal dominion, people must tremble in fear before the God of Daniel: For He is the living God, and He endures forever; His kingdom will never be destroyed, and His dominion has no end.
27Dn 6:27 He rescues and delivers; He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."
27Dn 6:28 So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27Dn 7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream with visions in his mind as he was lying in his bed. He wrote down the dream, and here is the summary of his account.
27Dn 7:2 Daniel said, "In my vision at night I was watching, and suddenly the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea.
27Dn 7:3 Four huge beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other.
27Dn 7:4 "The first was like a lion but had eagle's wings. I continued watching until its wings were torn off. It was lifted up from the ground, set on its feet like a man, and given a human mind.
27Dn 7:5 "Suddenly, another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up! Gorge yourself on flesh.'
27Dn 7:6 "While I was watching, another beast appeared. It was like a leopard with four wings of a bird on its back. It had four heads and was given authority to rule.
27Dn 7:7 "While I was watching in the night visions, a fourth beast appeared, frightening and dreadful, and incredibly strong, with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and it trampled with its feet whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had 10 horns.
27Dn 7:8 "While I was considering the horns, suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. There were eyes in this horn like a man's, and it had a mouth that spoke arrogantly.
27Dn 7:9 "As I kept watching, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white like snow, and the hair of His head like whitest wool. His throne was flaming fire; its wheels were blazing fire.
27Dn 7:10 A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His presence. Thousands upon thousands served Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was convened, and the books were opened.
27Dn 7:11 "I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire.
27Dn 7:12 As for the rest of the beasts, their authority to rule was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time.
27Dn 7:13 I continued watching in the night visions, and I saw One like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was escorted before Him.
27Dn 7:14 He was given authority to rule, and glory, and a kingdom; so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.
27Dn 7:15 "As for me, Daniel, my spirit was deeply distressed within me, and the visions in my mind terrified me.
27Dn 7:16 I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he let me know the interpretation of these things:
27Dn 7:17 'These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will rise from the earth.
27Dn 7:18 But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever.'
27Dn 7:19 "Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one different from all the others, extremely terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, devouring, crushing, and trampling with its feet whatever was left.
27Dn 7:20 [I also wanted to know] about the 10 horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three fell-- the horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that was more visible than the others.
27Dn 7:21 As I was watching, this horn made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them
27Dn 7:22 until the Ancient of Days arrived and a judgment was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, for the time had come, and the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.
27Dn 7:23 "This is what he said: 'The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.
27Dn 7:24 The 10 horns are 10 kings who will rise from this kingdom. Another, different from the previous ones, will rise after them and subdue three kings.
27Dn 7:25 He will speak words against the Most High and oppress the holy ones of the Most High. He will intend to change religious festivals and laws, and the holy ones will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time.
27Dn 7:26 But the court will convene, and his dominion will be taken away, to be completely destroyed forever.
27Dn 7:27 The kingdom, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.'
27Dn 7:28 "This is the end of the interpretation. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me greatly, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself."
27Dn 8:1 In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier.
27Dn 8:2 I saw the vision, and as I watched, I was in the fortress city of Susa, in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal.
27Dn 8:3 I looked up, and there was a ram standing beside the canal. He had two horns. The two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up last.
27Dn 8:4 I saw the ram charging to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand against him, and there was no rescue from his power. He did whatever he wanted and became great.
27Dn 8:5 As I was observing, a male goat appeared, coming from the west across the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
27Dn 8:6 He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with savage fury.
27Dn 8:7 I saw him approaching the ram, and infuriated with him, he struck the ram, shattering his two horns, and the ram was not strong enough to stand against him. The goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his power.
27Dn 8:8 Then the male goat became very great, but when he became powerful, the large horn was shattered. Four conspicuous horns came up in its place, [pointing] toward the four winds of heaven.
27Dn 8:9 From one of them a little horn emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land.
27Dn 8:10 It grew as high as the heavenly host, made some of the stars and some of the host fall to the earth, and trampled them.
27Dn 8:11 It made itself great, even up to the Prince of the host; it removed His daily sacrifice and overthrew the place of His sanctuary.
27Dn 8:12 Because of rebellion, a host, together with the daily sacrifice, will be given over. The horn will throw truth to the ground and will be successful in whatever it does.
27Dn 8:13 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, "How long will [the events of] this vision last-- the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?"
27Dn 8:14 He said to me, "For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be restored."
27Dn 8:15 While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me someone who appeared to be a man.
27Dn 8:16 I heard a human voice calling from the middle of the Ulai: "Gabriel, explain the vision to this man."
27Dn 8:17 So he approached where I was standing; when he came near, I was terrified and fell facedown. "Son of man," he said to me, "understand that the vision refers to the time of the end."
27Dn 8:18 While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face [to the ground]. Then he touched me, made me stand up,
27Dn 8:19 and said, "I am here to tell you what will happen at the conclusion of the time of wrath, because it refers to the appointed time of the end.
27Dn 8:20 The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
27Dn 8:21 The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king.
27Dn 8:22 The four horns that took the place of the shattered horn represent four kingdoms. They will rise from that nation, but without its power.
27Dn 8:23 Near the end of their kingdoms, when the rebels have reached the full measure of their sin, an insolent king, skilled in intrigue, will come to the throne.
27Dn 8:24 His power will be great, but it will not be his own. He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the powerful along with the holy people.
27Dn 8:25 He will cause deceit to prosper through his cunning and by his influence, and in his own mind he will make himself great. In [a time of] peace, he will destroy many; he will even stand against the Prince of princes. But he will be shattered, not by human hands.
27Dn 8:26 The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true. Now you must seal up the vision because it refers to many days [in the future]."
27Dn 8:27 I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was greatly disturbed by the vision and could not understand it.
27Dn 9:1 In the first year of Darius, who was the son of Ahasuerus, was a Mede by birth, and was ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans--
27Dn 9:2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet that the number of years for the desolation of Jerusalem would be 70.
27Dn 9:3 So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petitions, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed: Ah, Lord-- the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commandments--
27Dn 9:5 we have sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled, and turned away from Your commandments and ordinances.
27Dn 9:6 We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, fathers, and all the people of the land.
27Dn 9:7 Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but this day public shame belongs to us: the men of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel-- those who are near and those who are far, in all the countries where You have dispersed them because of the disloyalty they have shown toward You.
27Dn 9:8 LORD, public shame belongs to us, our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You.
27Dn 9:9 Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, though we have rebelled against Him
27Dn 9:10 and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by following His instructions that He set before us through His servants the prophets.
27Dn 9:11 All Israel has broken Your law and turned away, refusing to obey You. The promised cursewritten in the law of Moses, the servant of God, has been poured out on us because we have sinned against Him.
27Dn 9:12 He has carried out His words that He spoke against us and against our rulers by bringing on us so great a disaster that nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever been done under all of heaven.
27Dn 9:13 Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not appeased the LORD our God by turning from our injustice and paying attention to Your truth.
27Dn 9:14 So the LORD kept the disaster in mind and brought it on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all He has done. But we have not obeyed Him.
27Dn 9:15 Now, Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made Your name [renowned] as it is this day, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly.
27Dn 9:16 Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, may Your anger and wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the injustices of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become an object of ridicule to all those around us.
27Dn 9:17 Therefore, our God, hear the prayer and the petitions of Your servant. Show Your favor to Your desolate sanctuary for the Lord's sake.
27Dn 9:18 Listen, my God, and hear. Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city called by Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You based on our righteous acts, but based on Your abundant compassion.
27Dn 9:19 Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for Your own sake, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.
27Dn 9:20 While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before Yahweh my God concerning the holy mountain of my God--
27Dn 9:21 while I was praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the first vision, came to me in my extreme weariness, about the time of the evening offering.
27Dn 9:22 He gave me this explanation: "Daniel, I've come now to give you understanding.
27Dn 9:23 At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out, and I have come to give it, for you are treasured [by God]. So consider the message and understand the vision:
27Dn 9:24 Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city-- to bring the rebellion to an end, to put a stop to sin, to wipe away injustice, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy place.
27Dn 9:25 Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and 62 weeks. It will be rebuilt with a plaza and a moat, but in difficult times.
27Dn 9:26 After those 62 weeks the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the coming prince will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come with a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations are decreed.
27Dn 9:27 He will make a firm covenant with many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and offering. And the abomination of desolation will be on a wing of the temple until the decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator."
27Dn 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. The message was true and was about a great conflict. He understood the message and had understanding of the vision.
27Dn 10:2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
27Dn 10:3 I didn't eat any rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I didn't put any oil [on my body] until the three weeks were over.
27Dn 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,
27Dn 10:5 I looked up, and there was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of gold from Uphaz around his waist.
27Dn 10:6 His body was like topaz, his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
27Dn 10:7 Only I, Daniel, saw the vision. The men who were with me did not see it, but a great terror fell on them, and they ran and hid.
27Dn 10:8 I was left alone, looking at this great vision. No strength was left in me; my face grew deathly pale,and I was powerless.
27Dn 10:9 I heard the words he said, and when I heard them I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
27Dn 10:10 Suddenly, a hand touched me and raised me to my hands and knees.
27Dn 10:11 He said to me, "Daniel, you are a man treasured [by God]. Understand the words that I'm saying to you. Stand on your feet, for I have now been sent to you." After he said this to me, I stood trembling.
27Dn 10:12 "Don't be afraid, Daniel," he said to me, "for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your prayers were heard. I have come because of your prayers.
27Dn 10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for 21 days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me after I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
27Dn 10:14 Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the last days, for the vision refers to those days."
27Dn 10:15 While he was saying these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless.
27Dn 10:16 Suddenly one with human likeness touched my lips. I opened my mouth and said to the one standing in front of me, "My lord, because of the vision, I am overwhelmed and powerless.
27Dn 10:17 How can someone like me, your servant, speak with someone like you, my lord? Now I have no strength, and there is no breath in me."
27Dn 10:18 Then the one with human likeness touched me again and strengthened me.
27Dn 10:19 He said, "Don't be afraid, you who are treasured [by God]. Peace to you; be very strong!" As he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
27Dn 10:20 He said, "Do you know why I've come to you? I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come.
27Dn 10:21 No one has the courage to support me against them except Michael, your prince. However, I will tell you what is recorded in the book of truth.
27Dn 11:1 In the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to strengthen and protect him.
27Dn 11:2 Now I will tell you the truth. "Three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will be far richer than the others. By the power he gains through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
27Dn 11:3 Then a warrior king will arise; he will rule a vast realm and do whatever he wants.
27Dn 11:4 But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven, but not to his descendants; it will not be the same kingdom that he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and will go to others besides them.
27Dn 11:5 "The king of the South will grow powerful, but one of his commanders will grow more powerful and will rule a kingdom greater than his.
27Dn 11:6 After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement. She will not retain power, and his strength will not endure. She will be given up, together with her entourage, her father, and the one who supported her during those times.
27Dn 11:7 In the place of the king of the South, one from her family will rise up, come against the army, and enter the fortress of the king of the North. He will take action against them and triumph.
27Dn 11:8 He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious articles of silver and gold. For some years he will stay away from the king of the North,
27Dn 11:9 who will enter the kingdom of the king of the South and then return to his own land.
27Dn 11:10 "His sons will mobilize for war and assemble a large number of armed forces. They will advance, sweeping through like a flood,and will again wage war as far as his fortress.
27Dn 11:11 Infuriated, the king of the South will march out to fight with the king of the North, who will raise a great multitude, but the multitude will be handed over to his enemy.
27Dn 11:12 When the multitude is carried off, he will become arrogant and cause tens of thousands to fall, but he will not triumph.
27Dn 11:13 The king of the North will again raise a multitude larger than the first. After some years he will advance with a great army and many supplies.
27Dn 11:14 "In those times many will rise up against the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will assert themselves to fulfill a vision, but they will fail.
27Dn 11:15 Then the king of the North will come, build up an assault ramp, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South will not stand; even their select troops will not be able to resist.
27Dn 11:16 The king of the North who comes against him will do whatever he wants, and no one can oppose him. He will establish himself in the beautiful landwith total destruction in his hand.
27Dn 11:17 He will resolve to come with the force of his whole kingdom and will reach an agreement with him. He will give him a daughter in marriage to destroy it, but she will not stand with him or support him.
27Dn 11:18 Then he will turn his attention to the coasts and islands and capture many. But a commander will put an end to his taunting; instead, he will turn his taunts against him.
27Dn 11:19 He will turn his attention back to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble, fall, and be no more.
27Dn 11:20 "In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger or in battle.
27Dn 11:21 "In his place a despised person will arise; royal honors will not be given to him, but he will come during a time of peaceand seize the kingdom by intrigue.
27Dn 11:22 A flood of forces will be swept away before him; they will be shattered, as well as the covenant prince.
27Dn 11:23 After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully. He will rise to power with a small nation.
27Dn 11:24 During a time of peace, he will come into the richest parts of the province and do what his fathers and predecessors never did. He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers, and he will make plans against fortified cities, but only for a time.
27Dn 11:25 "With a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will prepare for battle with an extremely large and powerful army, but he will not succeed, because plots will be made against him.
27Dn 11:26 Those who eat his provisions will destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall slain.
27Dn 11:27 The two kings, whose hearts are bent on evil, will speak lies at the same table but to no avail, for still the end will come at the appointed time.
27Dn 11:28 The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant; he will take action, then return to his own land.
27Dn 11:29 "At the appointed time he will come again to the South, but this time will not be like the first.
27Dn 11:30 Ships of Kittimwill come against him, and being intimidated, he will withdraw. Then he will rage against the holy covenant and take action. On his return, he will favor those who abandon the holy covenant.
27Dn 11:31 His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination of desolation.
27Dn 11:32 With flattery he will corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.
27Dn 11:33 Those who are wise among the people will give understanding to many, yet they will die by sword and flame, and be captured and plundered for a time.
27Dn 11:34 When defeated, they will be helped by some, but many others will join them insincerely.
27Dn 11:35 Some of the wise will fall so that they may be refined, purified, and cleansed until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
27Dn 11:36 "Then the king will do whatever he wants. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and he will say outrageous things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, because what has been decreed will be accomplished.
27Dn 11:37 He will not show regard for the gods of his fathers, the god longed for by women, or for any other god, because he will magnify himself above all.
27Dn 11:38 Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses-- a god his fathers did not know-- with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches.
27Dn 11:39 He will deal with the strongest fortresses with [the help of] a foreign god. He will greatly honor those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing land as a reward.
27Dn 11:40 "At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships. He will invade countries and sweep through them like a flood.
27Dn 11:41 He will also invade the beautiful land, and many will fall. But these will escape from his power: Edom, Moab, and the prominent people of the Ammonites.
27Dn 11:42 He will extend his power against the countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape.
27Dn 11:43 He will get control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt. The Libyans and Cushites will also be in submission.
27Dn 11:44 But reports from the east and the north will terrify him, and he will go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many.
27Dn 11:45 He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain, but he will meet his end with no one to help him.
27Dn 12:1 At that time Michael the great prince who stands watch over your people will rise up. There will be a time of distress such as never has occurred since nations came into being until that time. But at that time all your people who are found written in the book will escape.
27Dn 12:2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt.
27Dn 12:3 Those who are wise will shine like the bright expanse [of the heavens], and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
27Dn 12:4 "But you, Daniel, keep these words secret and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will roam about, and knowledge will increase."
27Dn 12:5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and two others were standing there, one on this bank of the river and one on the other.
27Dn 12:6 One said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long until the end of these extraordinary things?"
27Dn 12:7 Then I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river. He raised both his hands toward heaven and swore by Him who lives eternally that it would be for a time, times, and half [a time]. When the power of the holy people is shattered, all these things will be completed.
27Dn 12:8 I heard but did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?"
27Dn 12:9 He said, "Go on your way, Daniel, for the words are secret and sealed until the time of the end.
27Dn 12:10 Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; none of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand.
27Dn 12:11 From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.
27Dn 12:12 Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches 1,335 days.
27Dn 12:13 But as for you, go on your way to the end; you will rest, then rise to your destiny at the end of the days."

28Hs 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.
28Hs 1:2 When the LORD first spoke to Hosea, He said this to him: Go and marry a promiscuous wife and [have] children of promiscuity, for the whole land has been promiscuous by abandoning the LORD.
28Hs 1:3 So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
28Hs 1:4 Then the LORD said to him: Name him Jezreel, for in a little while I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu and put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
28Hs 1:5 On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
28Hs 1:6 She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, and the LORD said to him: Name her No Compassion, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel. I will certainly take them away.
28Hs 1:7 But I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will deliver them by the LORD their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry.
28Hs 1:8 After Gomer had weaned No Compassion, she conceived and gave birth to a son.
28Hs 1:9 Then the LORD said: Name him Not My People, for you are not My people, and I will not be your God.
28Hs 1:10  Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where they were told: You are not My people, they will be called: Sons of the living God.
28Hs 1:11 And the Judeans and the Israelites will be gathered together. They will appoint for themselves a single ruler, and go up from the land. For the day of Jezreel will be great.
28Hs 2:1  Call your brothers: My People and your sisters: Compassion.
28Hs 2:2 Rebuke your mother; rebuke [her]. For she is not My wife and I am not her husband. Let her remove the promiscuous look from her face and her adultery from between her breasts.
28Hs 2:3 Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her as she was on the day of her birth. I will make her like a desert and like a parched land, and I will let her die of thirst.
28Hs 2:4 I will have no compassion on her children because they are the children of promiscuity.
28Hs 2:5 For their mother is promiscuous; she conceived them and acted shamefully. For she thought: I will go after my lovers, the men who give me my food and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink.
28Hs 2:6 Therefore, this is what I will do: I will block her way with thorns; I will enclose her with a wall, so that she cannot find her paths.
28Hs 2:7 She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will seek them but not find [them]. Then she will think: I will go back to my former husband, for then it was better for me than now.
28Hs 2:8 She does not recognize that it is I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil. I lavished silver and gold on her, which they used for Baal.
28Hs 2:9 Therefore, I will take back My grain in its time and My new wine in its season; I will take away My wool and linen, which were to cover her nakedness.
28Hs 2:10 Now I will expose her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from My hands.
28Hs 2:11 I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths-- all her festivals.
28Hs 2:12 I will devastate her vines and fig trees. She thinks that these are her wages that her lovers have given her. I will turn them into a thicket, and the wild animals will eat them.
28Hs 2:13 And I will punish her for the days of the Baals when she burned incense to them, put on her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but forgot Me. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
28Hs 2:14 Therefore, I am going to persuade her, lead her to the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her.
28Hs 2:15 There I will give her vineyards back to her and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as [she did] in the days of her youth, as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt.
28Hs 2:16 In that day-- the LORD's declaration-- you will call [Me]: My husband, and no longer call Me: My Baal.
28Hs 2:17 For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth; they will no longer be remembered by their names.
28Hs 2:18 On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely.
28Hs 2:19 I will take you to be My wife forever. I will take you to be My wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion.
28Hs 2:20 I will take you to be My wife in faithfulness, and you will know the LORD.
28Hs 2:21 On that day I will respond-- the LORD's declaration. I will respond to the sky, and it will respond to the earth.
28Hs 2:22 The earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
28Hs 2:23 I will sow her in the land for Myself, and I will have compassion on No Compassion; I will say to Not My People: You are My people, and he will say: [You are] My God.
28Hs 3:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the LORD loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
28Hs 3:2 So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver and five bushels of barley.
28Hs 3:3 I said to her, "You must live with me many days. Don't be promiscuous or belong to any man, and I will act the same way toward you."
28Hs 3:4 For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without ephod or household idols.
28Hs 3:5 Afterwards, the people of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
28Hs 4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, people of Israel, for the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land: There is no truth, no faithful love, and no knowledge of God in the land!
28Hs 4:2 Cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery are rampant; one act of bloodshed follows another.
28Hs 4:3 For this reason the land mourns, and everyone who lives in it languishes, along with the wild animals and the birds of the sky; even the fish of the sea disappear.
28Hs 4:4 But let no one dispute; let no one argue, for My case is against you priests.
28Hs 4:5 You will stumble by day; the prophet will also stumble with you by night. And I will destroy your mother.
28Hs 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving as My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your sons.
28Hs 4:7 The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me. I will change their honor into disgrace.
28Hs 4:8 They feed on the sin of My people; they have an appetite for their transgressions.
28Hs 4:9 [The same judgment] will happen to both people and priests. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
28Hs 4:10 They will eat but not be satisfied; they will be promiscuous but not multiply; for they have abandoned their devotion to the LORD.
28Hs 4:11 Promiscuity, wine, and new wine take away [one's] understanding.
28Hs 4:12 My people consult their wooden [idols], and their divining rods inform them. For a spirit of promiscuity leads them astray; they act promiscuously in disobedience to their God.
28Hs 4:13 They sacrifice on the mountaintops, and they burn offerings on the hills, and under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, because their shade is pleasant. And so your daughters act promiscuously and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
28Hs 4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they act promiscuously or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go off with prostitutes and make sacrifices with cult prostitutes. People without discernment are doomed.
28Hs 4:15 Israel, if you act promiscuously, don't let Judah become guilty! Do not go to Gilgal or make a pilgrimage to Beth-aven, and do not swear an oath: As the LORD lives!
28Hs 4:16 For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn cow. Can the LORD now shepherd them like a lamb in an open meadow?
28Hs 4:17 Ephraim is attached to idols; leave him alone!
28Hs 4:18 When their drinking is over, they turn to promiscuity. Israel's leaders fervently love disgrace.
28Hs 4:19 A wind with its wings will carry them off, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.
28Hs 5:1 Hear this, priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, royal house! For the judgment applies to you because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor.
28Hs 5:2 Rebels are deeply involved in slaughter; I will be a punishment for all of them.
28Hs 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me. For now, Ephraim, you have acted promiscuously; Israel is defiled.
28Hs 5:4 Their actions do not allow [them] to return to their God, for a spirit of promiscuity is among them, and they do not know the LORD.
28Hs 5:5 Israel's arrogance testifies against them. Both Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their wickedness; even Judah will stumble with them.
28Hs 5:6 They go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD but do not find [Him]; He has withdrawn from them.
28Hs 5:7 They betrayed the LORD; indeed, they gave birth to illegitimate children. Now the New Moon will devour them along with their fields.
28Hs 5:8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; raise the war cry in Beth-aven: After you, Benjamin!
28Hs 5:9 Ephraim will become a desolation on the day of punishment; I announce what is certain among the tribes of Israel.
28Hs 5:10 The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers; I will pour out My fury on them like water.
28Hs 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, for he is determined to follow what is worthless.
28Hs 5:12 So I am like rot to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah.
28Hs 5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent [a delegation] to the great king. But he cannot cure you or heal your wound.
28Hs 5:14 For I am like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. Yes, I will tear [them] to pieces and depart. I will carry [them] off, and no one can rescue [them].
28Hs 5:15 I will depart and return to My place until they recognize their guilt and seek My face; they will search for Me in their distress.
28Hs 6:1 Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn [us], and He will heal us; He has wounded [us], and He will bind up our wounds.
28Hs 6:2 He will revive us after two days, and on the third day He will raise us up so we can live in His presence.
28Hs 6:3 Let us strive to know the LORD. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land.
28Hs 6:4 What am I going to do with you, Ephraim? What am I going to do with you, Judah? Your loyalty is like the morning mist and like the early dew that vanishes.
28Hs 6:5 This is why I have used the prophets to cut them down; I have killed them with the words of My mouth. My judgment strikes like lightning.
28Hs 6:6 For I desire loyalty and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
28Hs 6:7 But they, like Adam, have violated the covenant; there they have betrayed Me.
28Hs 6:8 Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with bloody footprints.
28Hs 6:9 Like robbers who wait in ambush for someone, a band of priests murders on the road to Shechem. They commit atrocities.
28Hs 6:10 I have seen something horrible in the house of Israel: Ephraim's promiscuity is there; Israel is defiled.
28Hs 6:11 A harvest is also appointed for you, Judah. When I return My people from captivity,
28Hs 7:1 when I heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim and the crimes of Samaria will be exposed. For they practice fraud; a thief breaks in; a gang pillages outside.
28Hs 7:2 But they never consider that I remember all their evil. Now their sins are all around them; they are right in front of My face.
28Hs 7:3 They please the king with their evil, the princes with their lies.
28Hs 7:4 All of them commit adultery; [they are] like an oven heated by a baker who stops stirring [the fire] from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
28Hs 7:5 On the day of our king, the princes are sick with the heat of wine-- there is a conspiracy with traitors.
28Hs 7:6 For they-- their hearts like an oven-- draw him into their oven. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
28Hs 7:7 All of them are as hot as an oven, and they consume their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls on Me.
28Hs 7:8 Ephraim has allowed himself to get mixed up with the nations. Ephraim is unturned bread, baked on a griddle.
28Hs 7:9 Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice.
28Hs 7:10 Israel's arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the LORD their God, and for all this, they do not seek Him.
28Hs 7:11 So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove; they call to Egypt, and they go to Assyria.
28Hs 7:12 As they are going, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will discipline them in accordance with the news that reaches their assembly.
28Hs 7:13 Woe to them, for they fled from Me; destruction to them, for they rebelled against Me! Though I want to redeem [them], they speak lies against Me.
28Hs 7:14 They do not cry to Me from their hearts; rather, they wail on their beds. They slash themselves for grain and wine; they turn away from Me.
28Hs 7:15 I trained and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against Me.
28Hs 7:16 They turn, but not to what is above; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of the cursing of their tongue. They will be ridiculed for this in the land of Egypt.
28Hs 8:1 [Put] the horn to your mouth! One like an eagle comes against the house of the LORD, because they transgress My covenant and rebel against My law.
28Hs 8:2 Israel cries out to Me: My God, we know You!
28Hs 8:3 Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.
28Hs 8:4 They have installed kings, but not through Me. They have appointed leaders, but without My approval. They make their silver and gold into idols for themselves for their own destruction.
28Hs 8:5 Your calf-idol is rejected, Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
28Hs 8:6 For this thing is from Israel-- a craftsman made it, and it is not God. The calf of Samaria will be smashed to bits!
28Hs 8:7 Indeed, they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if they did, foreigners would swallow it up.
28Hs 8:8 Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like discarded pottery.
28Hs 8:9 For they have gone up to Assyria [like] a wild donkey going off on its own. Ephraim has paid for love.
28Hs 8:10 Even though they hire [lovers] among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to decrease in number under the burden of the king and leaders.
28Hs 8:11 When Ephraim multiplied his altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning.
28Hs 8:12 Though I were to write out for him ten thousand points of My law, they would be regarded as something alien.
28Hs 8:13 Though they offer sacrificial gifts and eat the flesh, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their guilt and punish their sins; they will return to Egypt.
28Hs 8:14 Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has also multiplied fortified cities. I will send fire on their cities, and it will consume their citadels.
28Hs 9:1 Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly as the nations do, for you have acted promiscuously, leaving your God. You have loved the wages of a prostitute on every grain-threshing floor.
28Hs 9:2 Threshing floor and wine vat will not sustain them, and the new wine will fail them.
28Hs 9:3 They will not stay in the land of the LORD. Instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
28Hs 9:4 They will not pour out their wine offerings to the LORD, and their sacrifices will not please Him. Their [food] will be like the bread of mourners; all who eat it become defiled. For their bread will be for their appetites [alone]; it will not enter the house of the LORD.
28Hs 9:5 What will you do on a festival day, on the day of the LORD's feast?
28Hs 9:6 For even if they flee from devastation, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Thistles will take possession of their precious silver; thorns will invade their tents.
28Hs 9:7 The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have come. Let Israel recognize it! The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane, because of the magnitude of your guilt and hostility.
28Hs 9:8 Ephraim's watchman is with my God. The prophet [encounters] a fowler's snare on all his ways. Hostility is in the house of his God!
28Hs 9:9 They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their guilt; He will punish their sins.
28Hs 9:10 I discovered Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers like the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, consecrated themselves to Shame, and became detestable, like the thing they loved.
28Hs 9:11 Ephraim's glory will fly away like a bird: no birth, no gestation, no conception.
28Hs 9:12 Even if they raise children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them!
28Hs 9:13 I have seen Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a meadow, so Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner.
28Hs 9:14 Give them, LORD-- What should You give? Give them a womb that miscarries and breasts that are dry!
28Hs 9:15 All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I came to hate them. I will drive them from My house because of their evil, wicked actions. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious.
28Hs 9:16 Ephraim is blighted; their roots are withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will kill the precious offspring of their wombs.
28Hs 9:17 My God will reject them because they have not listened to Him; they will become wanderers among the nations.
28Hs 10:1 Israel is a lush vine; it yields fruit for itself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better they made the sacred pillars.
28Hs 10:2 Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.
28Hs 10:3 In fact, they are now saying: "We have no king! For we do not fear the LORD. What can a king do for us?"
28Hs 10:4 They speak [mere] words, taking false oaths while making covenants. So lawsuits break out like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
28Hs 10:5 The residents of Samaria will have anxiety over the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its idolatrous priests rejoiced over it; the people will mourn over it, over its glory. It will certainly depart from them.
28Hs 10:6 The calf itself will be taken to Assyria as an offering to the great king. Ephraim will experience shame; Israel will be ashamed of its counsel.
28Hs 10:7 Samaria's king will disappear like foam on the surface of the water.
28Hs 10:8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. They will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" and to the hills, "Fall on us!"
28Hs 10:9 Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; they have taken their stand there. Will not war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah?
28Hs 10:10 I will discipline them at my discretion; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their two crimes.
28Hs 10:11 Ephraim is a well-trained young cow that loves to thresh, but I will place a yoke on her fine neck. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will plow; Jacob will do the final plowing.
28Hs 10:12 Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your untilled ground. It is time to seek the LORD until He comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain.
28Hs 10:13 You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in your large number of soldiers,
28Hs 10:14 the roar of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortifications will be demolished in a day of war, like Shalman's destruction of Beth-arbel. Mothers will be dashed to pieces along with [their] children.
28Hs 10:15 So it will be done to you, Bethel, because of your extreme evil. At dawn the king of Israel will be totally destroyed.
28Hs 11:1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.
28Hs 11:2 [The more] they called them, [the more] they departed from Me. They kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols.
28Hs 11:3 It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never knew that I healed them.
28Hs 11:4 I led them with human cords, with ropes of kindness. To them I was like one who eases the yoke from their jaws; I bent down to give them food.
28Hs 11:5 Israel will not return to the land of Egypt and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to repent.
28Hs 11:6 A sword will whirl through his cities; it will destroy and devour the bars of his gates, because of their schemes.
28Hs 11:7 My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to Him on high, He will not exalt them at all.
28Hs 11:8 How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I surrender you, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? I have had a change of heart; My compassion is stirred!
28Hs 11:9 I will not vent the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not come in rage.
28Hs 11:10 They will follow the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.
28Hs 11:11 They will be roused like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
28Hs 11:12  Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel, with deceit. Judah still wanders with El and is faithful to holy ones.
28Hs 12:1 Ephraim chases the wind and pursues the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and violence. He makes a covenant with Assyria, and olive oil is carried to Egypt.
28Hs 12:2 The LORD also has a dispute with Judah. He is about to punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him based on his actions.
28Hs 12:3 In the womb he grasped his brother's heel, and as an adult he wrestled with God.
28Hs 12:4 Jacob struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor. He found him at Bethel, and there He spoke with him.
28Hs 12:5 Yahweh is the God of Hosts; Yahweh is His name.
28Hs 12:6 But you must return to your God. Maintain love and justice, and always put your hope in God.
28Hs 12:7 A merchant loves to extort with dishonest scales in his hands.
28Hs 12:8 But Ephraim says: "How rich I have become; I made it all myself. In all my earnings, no one can find any crime in me that I can be punished for!"
28Hs 12:9 I have been the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will make you live in tents again, as in the festival days.
28Hs 12:10 I spoke through the prophets and granted many visions; I gave parables through the prophets.
28Hs 12:11 Since Gilead is full of evil, they will certainly come to nothing. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal; even their altars will be like heaps of rocks on the furrows of a field.
28Hs 12:12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram. Israel worked to earn a wife; he tended flocks for a wife.
28Hs 12:13 The LORD brought Israel from Egypt by a prophet, and Israel was tended by a prophet.
28Hs 12:14 Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and repay him for his contempt.
28Hs 13:1 When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel. But he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
28Hs 13:2 Now they continue to sin and make themselves a cast image, idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. People say about them, "Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves."
28Hs 13:3 Therefore, they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes, like chaff blown from a threshing floor, or like smoke from a window.
28Hs 13:4 I have been the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but Me, and no Savior exists besides Me.
28Hs 13:5 I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
28Hs 13:6 When they had pasture, they became satisfied; they were satisfied, and their hearts became proud. Therefore they forgot Me.
28Hs 13:7 So I will be like a lion to them; I will lurk like a leopard on the path.
28Hs 13:8 I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs and tear open the rib cage over their hearts. I will devour them there like a lioness, like a wild beast that would rip them open.
28Hs 13:9 I will destroy you, Israel; you have no help but Me.
28Hs 13:10 Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities, and the rulers you demanded, saying: Give me a king and leaders?
28Hs 13:11 I give you a king in My anger and take away [a king] in My wrath.
28Hs 13:12 Ephraim's guilt is preserved; his sin is stored up.
28Hs 13:13 Labor pains come on him. He is not a wise son; when the time comes, he will not be born.
28Hs 13:14 I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death. Death, where are your barbs? Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from My eyes.
28Hs 13:15 Although he flourishes among [his] brothers, an east wind will come, a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert. His water source will fail, and his spring will run dry. The wind will plunder the treasury of every precious item.
28Hs 13:16  Samaria will bear her guilt because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.
28Hs 14:1 Israel, return to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled in your sin.
28Hs 14:2 Take words [of repentance] with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him: "Forgive all [our] sin and accept what is good, so that we may repay You with praise from our lips.
28Hs 14:3 Assyria will not save us, we will not ride on horses, and we will no longer proclaim: Our gods! to the work of our hands. For the fatherless receives compassion in You."
28Hs 14:4 I will heal their apostasy; I will freely love them, for My anger will have turned from him.
28Hs 14:5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily and take root like [the cedars of] Lebanon.
28Hs 14:6 His new branches will spread, and his splendor will be like the olive tree, his fragrance, like [the forest of] Lebanon.
28Hs 14:7 The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:8 Ephraim, why should I have anything more to do with idols? It is I who answer and watch over him. I am like a flourishing pine tree; your fruit comes from Me.
28Hs 14:9 Let whoever is wise understand these things, and whoever is insightful recognize them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.

29Jl 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
29Jl 1:2 Hear this, you elders; listen, all you inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors?
29Jl 1:3 Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children the next generation.
29Jl 1:4 What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten; and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.
29Jl 1:5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the sweet wine, for it has been taken from your mouth.
29Jl 1:6 For a nation has invaded My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
29Jl 1:7 It has devastated My grapevine and splintered My fig tree. It has stripped off its bark and thrown it away; its branches have turned white.
29Jl 1:8 Grieve like a young woman dressed in sackcloth, [mourning] for the husband of her youth.
29Jl 1:9 Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, who are ministers of the LORD, mourn.
29Jl 1:10 The fields are destroyed; the land grieves; indeed, the grain is destroyed; the new wine is dried up; and the olive oil fails.
29Jl 1:11 Be ashamed, you farmers, wail, you vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
29Jl 1:12 The grapevine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the date palm, and the apple-- all the trees of the orchard-- have withered. Indeed, human joy has dried up.
29Jl 1:13 Dress [in sackcloth] and lament, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar. Come and spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, because grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
29Jl 1:14 Announce a sacred fast; proclaim an assembly! Gather the elders and all the residents of the land at the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
29Jl 1:15 Woe because of that day! For the Day of the LORD is near and will come as devastation from the Almighty.
29Jl 1:16 Hasn't the food been cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
29Jl 1:17 The seeds lie shriveled in their casings. The storehouses are in ruin, and the granaries are broken down, because the grain has withered away.
29Jl 1:18 How the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander in confusion since they have no pasture. Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
29Jl 1:19 I call to You, LORD, for fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have devoured all the trees of the countryside.
29Jl 1:20 Even the wild animals cry out to You, for the river beds are dried up, and fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness.
29Jl 2:1 Blow the horn in Zion; sound the alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the residents of the land tremble, for the Day of the LORD is coming; in fact, it is near--
29Jl 2:2 a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and dense overcast, like the dawn spreading over the mountains; a great and strong people [appears], such as never existed in ages past and never will again in all the generations to come.
29Jl 2:3 A fire destroys in front of them, and behind them a flame devours. The land in front of them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it is like a desert wasteland; there is no escape from them.
29Jl 2:4 Their appearance is like that of horses, and they gallop like war horses.
29Jl 2:5 They bound on the tops of the mountains. Their sound is like the sound of chariots, like the sound of fiery flames consuming stubble, like a mighty army deployed for war.
29Jl 2:6 Nations writhe in horror before them; all faces turn pale.
29Jl 2:7 They attack as warriors [attack]; they scale walls as men of war [do]. Each goes on his own path, and they do not change their course.
29Jl 2:8 They do not push each other; each man proceeds on his own path. They dodge the missiles, never stopping.
29Jl 2:9 They storm the city; they run on the wall; they climb into the houses; they enter through the windows like thieves.
29Jl 2:10 The earth quakes before them; the sky shakes. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars cease their shining.
29Jl 2:11 The LORD raises His voice in the presence of His army. His camp is very large; Those who carry out His command are powerful. Indeed, the Day of the LORD is terrible and dreadful-- who can endure it?
29Jl 2:12 Even now-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
29Jl 2:13 Tear your hearts, not just your clothes, and return to the LORD your God. For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful love, and He relents from sending disaster.
29Jl 2:14 Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind Him, [so you can] offer grain and wine to the LORD your God.
29Jl 2:15 Blow the horn in Zion! Announce a sacred fast; proclaim an assembly.
29Jl 2:16 Gather the people; sanctify the congregation; assemble the aged; gather the children, even those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his bedroom, and the bride her honeymoon chamber.
29Jl 2:17 Let the priests, the LORD's ministers, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say: "Have pity on Your people, LORD, and do not make Your inheritance a disgrace, an object of scorn among the nations. Why should it be said among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"
29Jl 2:18 Then the LORD became jealous for His land and spared His people.
29Jl 2:19 The LORD answered His people: Look, I am about to send you grain, new wine, and olive oil. You will be satiated with them, and I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations.
29Jl 2:20 I will drive the northerner far from you and banish him to a dry and desolate land, his front ranks into the Dead Sea, and his rear guard into the Mediterranean Sea. His stench will rise; yes, his rotten smell will rise, for he has done catastrophic things.
29Jl 2:21 Don't be afraid, land; rejoice and be glad, for the LORD has done great things.
29Jl 2:22 Don't be afraid, wild animals, for the wilderness pastures have turned green, the trees bear their fruit, and the fig tree and grapevine yield their riches.
29Jl 2:23 Children of Zion, rejoice and be glad in the LORD your God, because He gives you the autumn rain for your vindication. He sends showers for you, both autumn and spring rain as before.
29Jl 2:24 The threshing floors will be full of grain, and the vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil.
29Jl 2:25 I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust ate, the young locust, the destroying locust, and the devouring locust-- My great army that I sent against you.
29Jl 2:26 You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied. You will praise the name of Yahweh your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. My people will never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:27 You will know that I am present in Israel and that I am the LORD your God, and there is no other. My people will never again be put to shame.
29Jl 2:28  After this I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions.
29Jl 2:29 I will even pour out My Spirit on the male and female slaves in those days.
29Jl 2:30 I will display wonders in the heavens and on the earth: blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
29Jl 2:31 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awe-inspiring Day of the LORD comes.
29Jl 2:32 Then everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved, for there will be an escape for those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, as the LORD promised, among the survivors the LORD calls.
29Jl 3:1  Yes, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29Jl 3:2 I will gather all the nations and take them to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. I will enter into judgment with them there because of My people, My inheritance Israel. The nations have scattered the Israelites in foreign countries and divided up My land.
29Jl 3:3 They cast lots for My people; they bartered a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine to drink.
29Jl 3:4 And also: Tyre, Sidon, and all the territories of Philistia-- what are you to Me? Are you paying Me back or trying to get even with Me? I will quickly bring retribution on your heads.
29Jl 3:5 For you took My silver and gold and carried My finest treasures to your temples.
29Jl 3:6 You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to remove them far from their own territory.
29Jl 3:7 Look, I am about to rouse them up from the place where you sold them; I will bring retribution on your heads.
29Jl 3:8 I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation, for the LORD has spoken.
29Jl 3:9 Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for holy war; rouse the warriors; let all the men of war advance and attack!
29Jl 3:10 Hammer your plowshares into swords and your pruning knives into spears. Let even the weakling say: I am a warrior.
29Jl 3:11 Come quickly, all you surrounding nations; gather yourselves. Bring down Your warriors there, LORD.
29Jl 3:12 Let the nations be roused and come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit down to judge all the surrounding nations.
29Jl 3:13 Swing the sickle because the harvest is ripe. Come and trample [the grapes] because the winepress is full; the wine vats overflow because the wickedness of the nations is great.
29Jl 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the Day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
29Jl 3:15 The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will cease their shining.
29Jl 3:16 The LORD will roar from Zion and raise His voice from Jerusalem; heaven and earth will shake. But the LORD will be a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the Israelites.
29Jl 3:17 Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy, and foreigners will never overrun it again.
29Jl 3:18 In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. All the streams of Judah will flow with water, and a spring will issue from the LORD's house, watering the Valley of Acacias.
29Jl 3:19 Egypt will become desolate, and Edom a desert wasteland, because of the violence [done] to the people of Judah in whose land they shed innocent blood.
29Jl 3:20 But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
29Jl 3:21 I will pardon their bloodguilt, [which] I have not pardoned, for the LORD dwells in Zion.

30Am 1:1 The words of Amos, who was one of the sheep breeders from Tekoa-- what he saw regarding Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
30Am 1:2 He said: The LORD roars from Zion and raises His voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the summit of Carmel withers.
30Am 1:3 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Damascus for three crimes, even four, because they threshed Gilead with iron sledges.
30Am 1:4 Therefore, I will send fire against Hazael's palace, and it will consume Ben-hadad's citadels.
30Am 1:5 I will break down the gates of Damascus. I will cut off the ruler from the Valley of Aven, and the one who wields the scepter from Beth-eden. The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir. The LORD has spoken.
30Am 1:6 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Gaza for three crimes, even four, because they exiled a whole community, handing them over to Edom.
30Am 1:7 Therefore, I will send fire against the walls of Gaza, and it will consume its citadels.
30Am 1:8 I will cut off the ruler from Ashdod, and the one who wields the scepter from Ashkelon. I will also turn My hand against Ekron, and the remainder of the Philistines will perish. The Lord God has spoken.
30Am 1:9 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Tyre for three crimes, even four, because they handed over a whole community of exiles to Edom and broke a treaty of brotherhood.
30Am 1:10 Therefore, I will send fire against the walls of Tyre, and it will consume its citadels.
30Am 1:11 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Edom for three crimes, even four, because he pursued his brother with the sword. He stifled his compassion, his anger tore [at them] continually, and he harbored his rage incessantly.
30Am 1:12 Therefore, I will send fire against Teman, and it will consume the citadels of Bozrah.
30Am 1:13 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing the Ammonites for three crimes, even four, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory.
30Am 1:14 Therefore, I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah, and it will consume its citadels. There will be shouting on the day of battle and a violent wind on the day of the storm.
30Am 1:15 Their king and his princes will go into exile together. The LORD has spoken.
30Am 2:1 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Moab for three crimes, even four, because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom.
30Am 2:2 Therefore, I will send fire against Moab, and it will consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die with a tumult, with shouting and the sound of the ram's horn.
30Am 2:3 I will cut off the judge from the land and kill all its officials with him. The LORD has spoken.
30Am 2:4 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Judah for three crimes, even four, because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept His statutes. The lies that their ancestors followed have led them astray.
30Am 2:5 Therefore, I will send fire against Judah, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem.
30Am 2:6 The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Israel for three crimes, even four, because they sell a righteous person for silver and a needy person for a pair of sandals.
30Am 2:7 They trample the heads of the poor on the dust of the ground and block the path of the needy. A man and his father have sexual relations with the same girl, profaning My holy name.
30Am 2:8 They stretch out beside every altar on garments taken as collateral, and they drink in the house of their God wine obtained through fines.
30Am 2:9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite as Israel advanced; his height was like the cedars, and he was as sturdy as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath.
30Am 2:10 And I brought you from the land of Egypt and led you 40 years in the wilderness in order to possess the land of the Amorite.
30Am 2:11 I raised up some of your sons as prophets and some of your young men as Nazirites. Is this not the case, Israelites? [This is] the LORD's declaration.
30Am 2:12 But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets: Do not prophesy.
30Am 2:13 Look, I am about to crush [you] in your place as a wagon full of sheaves crushes [grain].
30Am 2:14 Escape will fail the swift, the strong one will not prevail by his strength, and the brave will not save his life.
30Am 2:15 The archer will not stand [his ground], the [one who is] swift of foot will not save himself, and the one riding a horse will not save his life.
30Am 2:16 Even the most courageous of the warriors will flee naked on that day-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 3:1 Listen to this message that the LORD has spoken against you, Israelites, against the entire clan that I brought from the land of Egypt:
30Am 3:2 I have known only you out of all the clans of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities.
30Am 3:3 Can two walk together without agreeing to meet?
30Am 3:4 Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey? Does a young lion growl from its lair unless it has captured [something]?
30Am 3:5 Does a bird land in a trap on the ground if there is no bait for it? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has caught nothing?
30Am 3:6 If a ram's horn is blown in a city, aren't people afraid? If a disaster occurs in a city, hasn't the LORD done it?
30Am 3:7 Indeed, the Lord God does nothing without revealing His counsel to His servants the prophets.
30Am 3:8 A lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken; who will not prophesy?
30Am 3:9 Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt: Assemble on the mountains of Samaria and see the great turmoil in the city and the acts of oppression within it.
30Am 3:10 The people are incapable of doing right-- the LORD's declaration-- those who store up violence and destruction in their citadels.
30Am 3:11 Therefore, the Lord God says: An enemy will surround the land; he will destroy your strongholds and plunder your citadels.
30Am 3:12 The LORD says: As the shepherd snatches two legs or a piece of an ear from the lion's mouth, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be rescued with [only] the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch.
30Am 3:13 Listen and testify against the house of Jacob-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God, the God of Hosts.
30Am 3:14 I will punish the altars of Bethel on the day I punish Israel for its crimes; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
30Am 3:15 I will demolish the winter house and the summer house; the houses [inlaid with] ivory will be destroyed, and the great houses will come to an end-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:1 Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan who are on the hill of Samaria, women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who say to their husbands, "Bring us something to drink."
30Am 4:2 The Lord God has sworn by His holiness: Look, the days are coming when you will be taken away with hooks, every last [one] of you with fishhooks.
30Am 4:3 You will go through breaches in the wall, each woman straight ahead, and you will be driven along toward Harmon. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:4 Come to Bethel and rebel; rebel even more at Gilgal! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tenths every three days.
30Am 4:5 Offer leavened bread as a thank offering, and loudly proclaim your freewill offerings, for that is what you Israelites love [to do]! [This is] the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:6 I gave you absolutely nothing to eat in all your cities, a shortage of food in all your communities, yet you did not return to Me-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:7 I also withheld the rain from you while there were still three months until harvest. I sent rain on one city but no rain on another. One field received rain while a field with no rain withered.
30Am 4:8 Two or three cities staggered to another city to drink water but were not satisfied, yet you did not return to Me-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:9 I struck you with blight and mildew; the locust devoured your many gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees, yet you did not return to Me-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:10 I sent plagues like those of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I caused the stench of your camp to fill your nostrils, yet you did not return to Me-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:11 I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick snatched from a fire, yet you did not return to Me-- the LORD's declaration.
30Am 4:12 Therefore, Israel, that is what I will do to you, and since I will do that to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God!
30Am 4:13 He is here: the One who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man, the One who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth. Yahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name.
30Am 5:1 Listen to this message that I am singing for you, a lament, house of Israel:
30Am 5:2 She has fallen; Virgin Israel will never rise again. She lies abandoned on her land, with no one to raise her up.
30Am 5:3 For the Lord God says: The city that marches out a thousand [strong] will have [only] a hundred left, and the one that marches out a hundred [strong] will have [only] ten left in the house of Israel.
30Am 5:4 For the LORD says to the house of Israel: Seek Me and live!
30Am 5:5 Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal or journey to Beer-sheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile, and Bethel will come to nothing.
30Am 5:6 Seek Yahweh and live, or He will spread like fire [throughout] the house of Joseph; it will consume [everything,] with no one at Bethel to extinguish it.
30Am 5:7 Those who turn justice into wormwood throw righteousness to the ground.
30Am 5:8 The One who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns darkness into dawn and darkens day into night, who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the earth-- Yahweh is His name.
30Am 5:9 He brings destruction on the strong, and it falls on the stronghold.
30Am 5:10 They hate the one who convicts [the guilty] at the city gate and despise the one who speaks with integrity.
30Am 5:11 Therefore, because you trample on the poor and exact a grain tax from him, you will never live in the houses of cut stone you have built; you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted.
30Am 5:12 For I know your crimes are many and your sins innumerable. They oppress the righteous, take a bribe, and deprive the poor of justice at the gates.
30Am 5:13 Therefore, the wise person will keep silent at such a time, for the days are evil.
30Am 5:14 Seek good and not evil so that you may live, and the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be with you, as you have claimed.
30Am 5:15 Hate evil and love good; establish justice in the gate. Perhaps the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
30Am 5:16 Therefore Yahweh, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says: There will be wailing in all the public squares; they will cry out in anguish in all the streets. The farmer will be called on to mourn, and professional mournersto wail.
30Am 5:17 There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you. The LORD has spoken.
30Am 5:18 Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD! What will the Day of the LORD be for you? It will be darkness and not light.
30Am 5:19 It will be like a man who flees from a lion only to have a bear confront him. He goes home and rests his hand against the wall only to have a snake bite him.
30Am 5:20 Won't the Day of the LORD be darkness rather than light, even gloom without any brightness in it?
30Am 5:21 I hate, I despise your feasts! I can't stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.
30Am 5:22 Even if you offer Me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept [them]; I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings of fattened cattle.
30Am 5:23 Take away from Me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
30Am 5:24 But let justice flow like water, and righteousness, like an unfailing stream.
30Am 5:25 "House of Israel, was it sacrifices and grain offerings that you presented to Me during the 40 years in the wilderness?
30Am 5:26 But you have taken up Sakkuthyour king and Kaiwanyour star god, images you have made for yourselves.
30Am 5:27 So I will send you into exile beyond Damascus." Yahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name. He has spoken.
30Am 6:1 Woe to those who are at ease in Zion and to those who feel secure on the hill of Samaria-- the notable people in this first of the nations, those the house of Israel comes to.
30Am 6:2 Cross over to Calneh and see; go from there to great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours?
30Am 6:3 You dismiss any thought of the evil day and bring in a reign of violence.
30Am 6:4 They lie on beds [inlaid with] ivory, sprawled out on their couches, and dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall.
30Am 6:5 They improvise songs to the sound of the harp and invent their own musical instruments like David.
30Am 6:6 They drink wine by the bowlful and anoint themselves with the finest oils but do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
30Am 6:7 Therefore, they will now go into exile as the first of the captives, and the feasting of those who sprawl out will come to an end.
30Am 6:8 The Lord God has sworn by Himself-- the declaration of Yahweh, the God of Hosts: I loathe Jacob's pride and hate his citadels, so I will hand over the city and everything in it.
30Am 6:9 And if there are 10 men left in one house, they will die.
30Am 6:10 A close relative and a burner,will remove his corpse from the house. He will call to someone in the inner recesses of the house, "Any more with you?" That person will reply, "None." Then he will say, "Silence, because Yahweh's name must not be invoked."
30Am 6:11 For the LORD commands: The large house will be smashed to pieces, and the small house to rubble.
30Am 6:12 Do horses run on rock, or does someone plow [it] with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood--
30Am 6:13 you who rejoice over Lo-debar and say, "Didn't we capture Karnaim for ourselves by our own strength?"
30Am 6:14 But look, I am raising up a nation against you, house of Israel-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord, the God of Hosts-- and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of the Arabah.
30Am 7:1 The Lord God showed me this: He was forming a swarm of locusts at the time the spring crop first began to sprout-- after the cutting of the king's hay.
30Am 7:2 When the locusts finished eating the vegetation of the land, I said, "Lord God, please forgive! How will Jacob survive since he is so small?"
30Am 7:3 The LORD relented concerning this. "It will not happen," He said.
30Am 7:4 The Lord God showed me this: The Lord God was calling for a judgment by fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the land.
30Am 7:5 Then I said, "Lord God, please stop! How will Jacob survive since he is so small?"
30Am 7:6 The LORD relented concerning this. "This will not happen either," said the Lord God.
30Am 7:7 He showed me this: The Lord was standing there by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand.
30Am 7:8 The LORD asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" I replied, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel; I will no longer spare them:
30Am 7:9 Isaac's high places will be deserted, and Israel's sanctuaries will be in ruins; I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword."
30Am 7:10 Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent [word] to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you [right here] in the house of Israel. The land cannot endure all his words,
30Am 7:11 for Amos has said this: 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland.'"
30Am 7:12 Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go away, you seer! Flee to the land of Judah. Earn your living and give [your] prophecies there,
30Am 7:13 but don't ever prophesy at Bethel again, for it is the king's sanctuary and a royal temple."
30Am 7:14 So Amos answered Amaziah, "I was not a prophet or the son of a prophet; rather, I was a herdsman, and I took care of sycamore figs.
30Am 7:15 But the LORD took me from following the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to My people Israel.'"
30Am 7:16 Now hear the word of the LORD. You say: Do not prophesy against Israel; do not preach against the house of Isaac.
30Am 7:17 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Your wife will be a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, and your land will be divided up with a measuring line. You yourself will die on pagan soil, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland.
30Am 8:1 The Lord God showed me this: A basket of summer fruit.
30Am 8:2 He asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" I replied, "A basket of summer fruit." The LORD said to me, "The end has come for My people Israel; I will no longer spare them.
30Am 8:3 In that day the temple songs will become wailing"-- the Lord GOD's declaration. "Many dead bodies, thrown everywhere! Silence!"
30Am 8:4 Hear this, you who trample on the needy and do away with the poor of the land,
30Am 8:5 asking, "When will the New Moon be over so we may sell grain, and the Sabbath, so we may market wheat? We can reduce the measure while increasing the price and cheat with dishonest scales.
30Am 8:6 We can buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and even sell the wheat husks!"
30Am 8:7 The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: I will never forget all their deeds.
30Am 8:8 Because of this, won't the land quake and all who dwell in it mourn? All of it will rise like the Nile; it will surge and then subside like the Nile in Egypt.
30Am 8:9 And in that day-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- I will make the sun go down at noon; I will darken the land in the daytime.
30Am 8:10 I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; I will cause everyone to wear sackcloth and every head to be shaved. I will make that grief like mourning for an only son and its outcome like a bitter day.
30Am 8:11 Hear this! The days are coming-- [this is] the declaration of the Lord God-- when I will send a famine through the land: not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD.
30Am 8:12 People will stagger from sea to sea and roam from north to east, seeking the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.
30Am 8:13 In that day the beautiful young women, the young men also, will faint from thirst.
30Am 8:14 Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, "As your god lives, Dan," or "As the wayof Beer-sheba lives"-- they will fall, never to rise again.
30Am 9:1 I saw the LORD standing beside the altar, and He said: Strike the capitals of the pillars so that the thresholds shake; knock them down on the heads of all the people. Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword. None of those who flee will get away; none of their fugitives will escape.
30Am 9:2 If they dig down to Sheol, from there My hand will take them; if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down.
30Am 9:3 If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will track them down and seize them; if they conceal themselves from My sight on the sea floor, from there I will command the [sea] serpent to bite them.
30Am 9:4 And if they are driven by their enemies into captivity, from there I will command the sword to kill them. I will fix My eyes on them for harm and not for good.
30Am 9:5 The Lord, the God of Hosts-- He touches the earth; it melts, and all who dwell on it mourn; all of it rises like the Nile and subsides like the Nile of Egypt.
30Am 9:6 He builds His upper chambers in the heavens and lays the foundation of His vault on the earth. He summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth. Yahweh is His name.
30Am 9:7 Israelites, are you not like the Cushites to Me? [This is] the LORD's declaration. Didn't I bring Israel from the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?
30Am 9:8 Look, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth. However, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob-- the LORD's declaration--
30Am 9:9 for I am about to give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one shakes a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground.
30Am 9:10 All the sinners among My people, who say: Disaster will never overtake or confront us, will die by the sword.
30Am 9:11 In that day I will restore the fallen booth of David: I will repair its gaps, restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old,
30Am 9:12 so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that are called by My name-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- He will do this.
30Am 9:13 Hear this! The days are coming-- the LORD's declaration-- when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the one who treads grapes, the sower of seed. The mountains will drip with sweet wine, and all the hills will flow [with it].
30Am 9:14 I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel. They will rebuild and occupy ruined cities, plant vineyards and drink their wine, make gardens and eat their produce.
30Am 9:15 I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them. Yahweh your God has spoken.
31
31Ob 1:1 This is what the Lord God has said about Edom: We have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent among the nations: Rise up, and let us go to war against her.
31Ob 1:2 Look, I will make you insignificant among the nations; you will be deeply despised.
31Ob 1:3 Your presumptuous heart has deceived you, you who live in clefts of the rock in your home on the heights, who say to yourself: Who can bring me down to the ground?
31Ob 1:4 Though you seem to soar like an eagle and make your nest among the stars, even from there I will bring you down. [This is] the LORD's declaration.
31Ob 1:5 If thieves came to you, if marauders by night-- how ravaged you will be!-- wouldn't they steal only what they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn't they leave some grapes?
31Ob 1:6 How Esau will be pillaged, his hidden treasures searched out!
31Ob 1:7 Everyone who has a treaty with you will drive you to the border; everyone at peace with you will deceive and conquer you. Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you. He will be unaware of it.
31Ob 1:8 In that day-- the LORD's declaration-- will I not eliminate the wise ones of Edom and those who understand from the hill country of Esau?
31Ob 1:9 Teman, your warriors will be terrified so that everyone from the hill country of Esau will be destroyed by slaughter.
31Ob 1:10 You will be covered with shame and destroyed forever because of violence done to your brother Jacob.
31Ob 1:11 On the day you stood aloof, on the day strangers captured his wealth, while foreigners entered his gate and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were just like one of them.
31Ob 1:12 Do not gloat over your brother in the day of his calamity; do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction; do not boastfully mock in the day of distress.
31Ob 1:13 Do not enter the gate of My people in the day of their disaster. Yes, you-- do not gloat over their misery in the day of their disaster and do not appropriate their possessions in the day of their disaster.
31Ob 1:14 Do not stand at the crossroads to cut off their fugitives, and do not hand over their survivors in the day of distress.
31Ob 1:15 For the Day of the LORD is near, against all the nations. As you have done, so it will be done to you; what you deserve will return on your own head.
31Ob 1:16 For as you have drunk on My holy mountain, so all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and gulp down and be as though they had never been.
31Ob 1:17 But there will be a deliverance on Mount Zion, and it will be holy; the house of Jacob will dispossess those who dispossessed them.
31Ob 1:18 Then the house of Jacob will be a [blazing] fire, and the house of Joseph a [burning] flame, but the house of Esau will be stubble; they will set them on fire and consume them. Therefore no survivor will remain of the house of Esau, for the LORD has spoken.
31Ob 1:19 [People from] the Negev will possess the hill country of Esau; [those from] the Judean foothills will possess [the land of] the Philistines. They will possess the territories of Ephraim and Samaria, while Benjamin will possess Gilead.
31Ob 1:20 The exiles of the Israelites who are in Halah who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negev.
31Ob 1:21 Saviors will ascend Mount Zion to rule over the hill country of Esau, but the kingdom will be the LORD's.

32Jnh 1:1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:
32Jnh 1:2 "Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because their wickedness has confronted Me."
32Jnh 1:3 However, Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the LORD's presence. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, from the LORD's presence.
32Jnh 1:4 Then the LORD hurled a violent wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break apart.
32Jnh 1:5 The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his god. They threw the ship's cargo into the sea to lighten the load. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel and had stretched out and fallen into a deep sleep.
32Jnh 1:6 The captain approached him and said, "What are you doing sound asleep? Get up! Call to your god. Maybe this god will consider us, and we won't perish."
32Jnh 1:7 "Come on!" the sailors said to each other. "Let's cast lots. Then we will know who is to blame for this trouble we're in." So they cast lots, and the lot singled out Jonah.
32Jnh 1:8 Then they said to him, "Tell us who is to blame for this trouble we're in. What is your business and where are you from? What is your country and what people are you from?"
32Jnh 1:9 He answered them, "I am a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land."
32Jnh 1:10 Then the men were even more afraid and said to him, "What is this you've done?" For the men knew he was fleeing from the LORD's presence, because he had told them.
32Jnh 1:11 So they said to him, "What should we do to you to calm this sea that's against us?" For the sea was getting worse and worse.
32Jnh 1:12 He answered them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea so it may quiet down for you, for I know that I'm to blame for this violent storm that is against you."
32Jnh 1:13 Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not because the sea was raging against them more and more.
32Jnh 1:14 So they called out to the LORD: "Please, Yahweh, don't let us perish because of this man's life, and don't charge us with innocent blood! For You, Yahweh, have done just as You pleased."
32Jnh 1:15 Then they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
32Jnh 1:16 The men feared the LORD even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
32Jnh 1:17  Then the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the fish three days and three nights.
32Jnh 2:1 Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish:
32Jnh 2:2 I called to the LORD in my distress, and He answered me. I cried out for help in the belly of Sheol; You heard my voice.
32Jnh 2:3 You threw me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, and the current overcame me. All Your breakers and Your billows swept over me.
32Jnh 2:4 But I said: I have been banished from Your sight, yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.
32Jnh 2:5 The waters engulfed me up to the neck; the watery depths overcame me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
32Jnh 2:6 I sank to the foundations of the mountains; the earth with its prison bars closed behind me forever! But You raised my life from the Pit, LORD my God!
32Jnh 2:7 As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer came to You, to Your holy temple.
32Jnh 2:8 Those who cling to worthless idols forsake faithful love,
32Jnh 2:9 but as for me, I will sacrifice to You with a voice of thanksgiving. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!
32Jnh 2:10 Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
32Jnh 3:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:
32Jnh 3:2 "Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach the message that I tell you."
32Jnh 3:3 So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the LORD's command. Now Nineveh was an extremely large city, a three-day walk.
32Jnh 3:4 Jonah set out on the first day of his walk in the city and proclaimed, "In 40 days Nineveh will be overthrown!"
32Jnh 3:5 The men of Nineveh believed in God. They proclaimed a fast and dressed in sackcloth-- from the greatest of them to the least.
32Jnh 3:6 When word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
32Jnh 3:7 Then he issued a decree in Nineveh: By order of the king and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, is to taste anything at all. They must not eat or drink water.
32Jnh 3:8 Furthermore, both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth, and everyone must call out earnestly to God. Each must turn from his evil ways and from the violence he is doing.
32Jnh 3:9 Who knows? God may turn and relent; He may turn from His burning anger so that we will not perish.
32Jnh 3:10 Then God saw their actions-- that they had turned from their evil ways-- so God relented from the disaster He had threatened to do to them. And He did not do it.
32Jnh 4:1 But Jonah was greatly displeased and became furious.
32Jnh 4:2 He prayed to the LORD: "Please, LORD, isn't this what I said while I was still in my own country? That's why I fled toward Tarshish in the first place. I knew that You are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to become angry, rich in faithful love, and One who relents from [sending] disaster.
32Jnh 4:3 And now, LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:4 The LORD asked, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
32Jnh 4:5 Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made himself a shelter there and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city.
32Jnh 4:6 Then the LORD God appointed a plant, and it grew up to provide shade over Jonah's head to ease his discomfort. Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant.
32Jnh 4:7 When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, and it withered.
32Jnh 4:8 As the sun was rising, God appointed a scorching east wind. The sun beat down on Jonah's head so that he almost fainted, and he wanted to die. He said, "It's better for me to die than to live."
32Jnh 4:9 Then God asked Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?" "[Yes,]" he replied. "It is right. I'm angry enough to die!"
32Jnh 4:10 So the LORD said, "You cared about the plant, which you did not labor over and did not grow. It appeared in a night and perished in a night.
32Jnh 4:11 Should I not care about the great city of Nineveh, which has more than 120,000 people who cannot distinguish between their right and their left, as well as many animals?"

33Mc 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite-- what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
33Mc 1:2 Listen, all you peoples; pay attention, earth and everyone in it! The Lord God will be a witness against you, the Lord, from His holy temple.
33Mc 1:3 Look, the LORD is leaving His place and coming down to trample the heights of the earth.
33Mc 1:4 The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart, like wax near a fire, like water cascading down a mountainside.
33Mc 1:5 All this will happen because of Jacob's rebellion and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Isn't it Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Isn't it Jerusalem?
33Mc 1:6 Therefore, I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the countryside, a planting area for a vineyard. I will roll her stones into the valley and expose her foundations.
33Mc 1:7 All her carved images will be smashed to pieces, all her wages will be burned in the fire, and I will destroy all her idols. Since she collected the wages of a prostitute, they will be used again for a prostitute.
33Mc 1:8 Because of this I will lament and wail; I will walk barefoot and naked. I will howl like the jackals and mourn like ostriches.
33Mc 1:9 For her wound is incurable and has reached even Judah; it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:10 Don't announce it in Gath, don't weep at all. In Beth-leaphrah roll in the dust.
33Mc 1:11 Depart in shameful nakedness, you residents of Shaphir; the residents of Zaanan will not come out. Beth-ezel is lamenting; its support is taken from you.
33Mc 1:12 Though the residents of Maroth anxiously wait for something good, calamity has come from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:13 Harness the horses to the chariot, you residents of Lachish. This was the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion, because Israel's acts of rebellion can be traced to you.
33Mc 1:14 Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib are a deception to the kings of Israel.
33Mc 1:15 I will again bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobility of Israel will come to Adullam.
33Mc 1:16 Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair in sorrow for your precious children; make yourselves as bald as an eagle, for they have been taken from you into exile.
33Mc 2:1 Woe to those who dream up wickedness and prepare evil [plans] on their beds! At morning light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.
33Mc 2:2 They covet fields and seize them; they also take houses. They deprive a man of his home, a person of his inheritance.
33Mc 2:3 Therefore, the LORD says: I am now planning a disaster against this nation; you cannot free your necks from it. Then you will not walk so proudly because it will be an evil time.
33Mc 2:4 In that day one will take up a taunt against you, and lament mournfully, saying: We are totally ruined! He measures out the allotted land of my people. How He removes [it] from me! He allots our fields to traitors.
33Mc 2:5 Therefore, there will be no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by casting lots.
33Mc 2:6 "Stop your preaching," they preach. "They should not preach these things; shame will not overtake us."
33Mc 2:7 House of Jacob, should it be asked: "Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these the things He does?" Don't My words bring good to the one who walks uprightly?
33Mc 2:8 But recently My people have risen up like an enemy: You strip off the splendid robe from those who are passing through confidently, like those returning from war.
33Mc 2:9 You force the women of My people out of their comfortable homes, and you take My blessing from their children forever.
33Mc 2:10 Get up and leave, for this is not your place of rest, because defilement brings destruction-- a grievous destruction!
33Mc 2:11 If a man of spirit comes and invents lies: "I will preach to you about wine and beer," he would be just the preacher for this people!
33Mc 2:12 I will indeed gather all of you, Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the middle of its fold. It will be noisy with people.
33Mc 2:13 One who breaks open [the way] will advance before them; they will break out, pass through the gate, and leave by it. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader.
33Mc 3:1 Then I said: "Now listen, leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Aren't you supposed to know what is just?
33Mc 3:2 You hate good and love evil. You tear off the skin of people and [strip] their flesh from their bones.
33Mc 3:3 You eat the flesh of my people after you strip their skin from them and break their bones. You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot, like meat in a caldron."
33Mc 3:4 Then they will cry out to the LORD, but He will not answer them. He will hide His face from them at that time because of the crimes they have committed.
33Mc 3:5 This is what the LORD says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who proclaim peace when they have [food] to sink their teeth into but declare war against the one who puts nothing in their mouths.
33Mc 3:6 Therefore, it will be night for you-- without visions; it will grow dark for you-- without divination. The sun will set on these prophets, and the daylight will turn black over them.
33Mc 3:7 Then the seers will be ashamed and the diviners disappointed. They will all cover their mouths because there will be no answer from God.
33Mc 3:8 But as for me, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD, with justice and courage, to proclaim to Jacob his rebellion and to Israel his sin.
33Mc 3:9 Listen to this, leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice and pervert everything that is right,
33Mc 3:10 who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice.
33Mc 3:11 Her leaders issue rulings for a bribe, her priests teach for payment, and her prophets practice divination for money. Yet they lean on the Lord, saying, "Isn't the LORD among us? No calamity will overtake us."
33Mc 3:12 Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket.
33Mc 4:1 In the last days the mountain of the LORD's house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. Peoples will stream to it,
33Mc 4:2 and many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about His ways so we may walk in His paths." For instruction will go out of Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:3 He will settle disputes among many peoples and provide arbitration for strong nations that are far away. They will beat their swords into plows, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not take up the sword against nation, and they will never again train for war.
33Mc 4:4 But each man will sit under his grapevine and under his fig tree with no one to frighten [him]. For the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has promised [this].
33Mc 4:5 Though all the peoples each walk in the name of their gods, we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
33Mc 4:6 On that day-- [this is] the LORD's declaration-- I will assemble the lame and gather the scattered, those I have injured.
33Mc 4:7 I will make the lame into a remnant, those far removed into a strong nation. Then the LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from this time on and forever.
33Mc 4:8 And you, watchtower for the flock, fortified hill of Daughter Zion, the former rule will come to you, sovereignty will come to Daughter Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:9 Now, why are you shouting loudly? Is there no king with you? Has your counselor perished, so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?
33Mc 4:10 Writhe and cry out, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor. For now you will leave the city and camp in the open fields. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the power of your enemies!
33Mc 4:11 Many nations have now assembled against you; they say, "Let her be defiled, and let us feast our eyes on Zion."
33Mc 4:12 But they do not know the LORD's intentions or understand His plan, that He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
33Mc 4:13 Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will make your horns iron and your hooves bronze, so you can crush many peoples. Then you will devote what they plundered to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
33Mc 5:1  Now daughter [who is] under attack, you slash yourself [in grief]; a siege is set against us! They are striking the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod.
33Mc 5:2  Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are small among the clans of Judah; One will come from you to be ruler over Israel for Me. His origin is from antiquity, from eternity.
33Mc 5:3 Therefore, He will abandon them until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of His brothers will return to the people of Israel.
33Mc 5:4 He will stand and shepherd [them] in the strength of Yahweh, in the majestic name of Yahweh His God. They will live securely, for then His greatness will extend to the ends of the earth.
33Mc 5:5 There will be peace. When Assyria invades our land, when it marches against our fortresses, we will raise against it seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
33Mc 5:6 They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with a drawn blade. So He will rescue us from Assyria when it invades our land, when it marches against our territory.
33Mc 5:7 Then the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or linger for mankind.
33Mc 5:8 Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples, like a lion among animals of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which tramples and tears as it passes through, and there is no one to rescue [them].
33Mc 5:9 Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, and all your enemies will be destroyed.
33Mc 5:10 In that day-- the LORD's declaration-- I will remove your horses from you and wreck your chariots.
33Mc 5:11 I will remove the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses.
33Mc 5:12 I will remove sorceries from your hands, and you will not have any more fortune-tellers.
33Mc 5:13 I will remove your carved images and sacred pillars from you, so that you will not bow down again to the work of your hands.
33Mc 5:14 I will pull up the Asherah poles from among you and demolish your cities.
33Mc 5:15 I will take vengeance in anger and wrath against the nations that have not obeyed [Me].
33Mc 6:1 Now listen to what the LORD is saying: Rise, plead [your] case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
33Mc 6:2 Listen to the LORD's lawsuit, you mountains and enduring foundations of the earth, because the LORD has a case against His people, and He will argue it against Israel.
33Mc 6:3 My people, what have I done to you, or how have I wearied you? Testify against Me!
33Mc 6:4 Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from that place of slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you.
33Mc 6:5 My people, remember what Balak king of Moab proposed, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and [what happened] from Acacia Grove to Gilgal, so that you may acknowledge the LORD's righteous acts.
33Mc 6:6 What should I bring before the LORD when I come to bow before God on high? Should I come before Him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?
33Mc 6:7 Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand streams of oil? Should I give my firstborn for my transgression, the child of my body for my own sin?
33Mc 6:8 He has told you men what is good and what it is the LORD requires of you: Only to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God.
33Mc 6:9 The voice of the LORD calls out to the city (and it is wise to fear Your name): "Pay attention to the rod and the One who ordained it.
33Mc 6:10 Are there still the treasures of wickedness and the accursed short measure in the house of the wicked?
33Mc 6:11 Can I excuse wicked scales or bags of deceptive weights?
33Mc 6:12 For the wealthy of the city are full of violence, and its residents speak lies; the tongues in their mouths are deceitful.
33Mc 6:13 "As a result, I have begun to strike you severely, bringing desolation because of your sins.
33Mc 6:14 You will eat but not be satisfied, for there will be hunger within you. What you acquire, you cannot save, and what you do save, I will give to the sword.
33Mc 6:15 You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not anoint yourself with oil; and [you will tread] grapes but not drink the wine.
33Mc 6:16 The statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab's house have been observed; you have followed their policies. Therefore, I will make you a desolate place and the city's residents an object of contempt; you will bear the scorn of My people."
33Mc 7:1 How sad for me! For I am like one who-- when the summer fruit has been gathered after the gleaning of the grape harvest-- [finds] no grape cluster to eat, no early fig, which I crave.
33Mc 7:2 Godly people have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people. All of them wait in ambush to shed blood; they hunt each other with a net.
33Mc 7:3 Both hands are good at accomplishing evil: the official and the judge demand a bribe; when the powerful man communicates his evil desire, they plot it together.
33Mc 7:4 The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is worse than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchmen, [the day of] your punishment, is coming; at this time their panic is here.
33Mc 7:5 Do not rely on a friend; don't trust in a close companion. Seal your mouth from the woman who lies in your arms.
33Mc 7:6 For a son considers his father a fool, a daughter opposes her mother, and a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law; a person's enemies are the people in his own home.
33Mc 7:7 But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
33Mc 7:8 Do not rejoice over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will stand up; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
33Mc 7:9 Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the LORD's rage until He argues my case and establishes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His salvation.
33Mc 7:10 Then my enemy will see, and she will be covered with shame, the one who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look at her in triumph; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets.
33Mc 7:11 A day will come for rebuilding your walls; on that day [your] boundary will be extended.
33Mc 7:12 On that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates River and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
33Mc 7:13 Then the earth will become a wasteland because of its inhabitants, and as a result of their actions.
33Mc 7:14 Shepherd Your people with Your staff, the flock that is Your possession. They live alone in a scrubland, surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in ancient times.
33Mc 7:15 I will show them wondrous deeds as in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt.
33Mc 7:16 Nations will see and be ashamed of all their power. They will put [their] hands over [their] mouths, and their ears will become deaf.
33Mc 7:17 They will lick the dust like a snake; they will come trembling out of their hiding places like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will tremble before the LORD our God; they will stand in awe of You.
33Mc 7:18 Who is a God like You, removing iniquity and passing over rebellion for the remnant of His inheritance? He does not hold on to His anger forever, because He delights in faithful love.
33Mc 7:19 He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
33Mc 7:20 You will show loyalty to Jacob and faithful love to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from days long ago.

34Nah 1:1 The oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
34Nah 1:2 The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is fierce in wrath. The LORD takes vengeance against His foes; He is furious with His enemies.
34Nah 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will never leave [the guilty] unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
34Nah 1:4 He rebukes the sea so that it dries up, and He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; even the flower of Lebanon withers.
34Nah 1:5 The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; the earth tremblesat His presence-- the world and all who live in it.
34Nah 1:6 Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, even rocks are shattered before Him.
34Nah 1:7 The LORD is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; He cares for those who take refuge in Him.
34Nah 1:8 But He will completely destroy Nineveh with an overwhelming flood, and He will chase His enemies into darkness.
34Nah 1:9 Whatever you plot against the Lord, He will bring [it] to complete destruction; oppression will not rise up a second time.
34Nah 1:10 For they will be consumed like entangled thorns, like a drunkard's drink, and like straw that is fully dry.
34Nah 1:11 One has gone out from Nineveh, who plots evil against the LORD, and is a wicked counselor.
34Nah 1:12 This is what the LORD says: Though they are strong and numerous, they will still be mowed down, and he will pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer.
34Nah 1:13 For I will now break off his yoke from you and tear off your shackles.
34Nah 1:14 The LORD has issued an order concerning you: There will be no offspring to carry on your name. I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.
34Nah 1:15  Look to the mountains-- the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out.
34Nah 2:1 One who scatters is coming up against you. Man the fortifications! Watch the road! Brace yourself! Summon all your strength!
34Nah 2:2 For the LORD will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel, though ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their vine branches.
34Nah 2:3 The shields of his warriors are dyed red; the valiant men are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariot flash like fire on the day of its [battle] preparations, and the spears are brandished.
34Nah 2:4 The chariots dash madly through the streets; they rush around in the plazas. They look like torches; they dart back and forth like lightning.
34Nah 2:5 He gives orders to his officers; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.
34Nah 2:6 The river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away.
34Nah 2:7 Beauty is stripped, she is carried away; her ladies-in-waiting moan like the sound of doves, and beat their breasts.
34Nah 2:8 Nineveh has been like a pool of water from her [first] days, but they are fleeing. "Stop! Stop!" [they cry,] but no one turns back.
34Nah 2:9 "Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!" There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.
34Nah 2:10 Desolation, decimation, devastation! Hearts melt, knees tremble, loins shake, every face grows pale!
34Nah 2:11 Where is the lions' lair, or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled, and the lion's cub, with nothing to frighten them away?
34Nah 2:12 The lion mauled whatever its cubs needed and strangled [prey] for its lionesses. It filled up its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey.
34Nah 2:13 Beware, I am against you-- the declaration of the Lord of Hosts. I will make your chariots go up in smoke and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the sound of your messengers will never be heard again.
34Nah 3:1 Woe to the city of blood, totally deceitful, full of plunder, never without prey.
34Nah 3:2 The crack of the whip and rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and jolting chariot!
34Nah 3:3 Charging horseman, flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses, dead bodies without end-- they stumble over their dead.
34Nah 3:4 Because of the continual prostitution of the prostitute, the attractive mistress of sorcery, who betrays nations by her prostitution and clans by her witchcraft,
34Nah 3:5 I am against you-- the declaration of the Lord of Hosts. I will lift your skirts over your face and display your nakedness to nations, your shame to kingdoms.
34Nah 3:6 I will throw filth on you and treat you with contempt; I will make a spectacle of you.
34Nah 3:7 Then all who see you will recoil from you, saying: Nineveh is devastated; who will show sympathy to her? Where can I find anyone to comfort you?
34Nah 3:8 Are you better than Thebes that sat along the Nile with water surrounding her, whose rampart was the sea, the river her wall?
34Nah 3:9 Cush and Egypt were her endless source of strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.
34Nah 3:10 Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity. Her children were also dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her nobles were bound in chains.
34Nah 3:11 You also will become drunk; you will hide yourself. You also will seek refuge from the enemy.
34Nah 3:12 All your fortresses are fig trees with figs that ripened first; when shaken, they fall-- right into the mouth of the eater!
34Nah 3:13 Look, your troops are women among you; the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars [of your gates].
34Nah 3:14 Draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses. Step into the clay and tread the mortar; take hold of the brick-mold!
34Nah 3:15 The fire will devour you there; the sword will cut you down. It will devour you like the young locust. Multiply yourselves like the young locust, multiply like the swarming locust!
34Nah 3:16 You have made your merchants more numerous than the stars of the sky. The young locust strips [the land] and flies away.
34Nah 3:17 Your court officials are like the swarming locust, and your scribes like clouds of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day; when the sun rises, they take off, and no one knows where they are.
34Nah 3:18 King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your officers sleep. Your people are scattered across the mountains with no one to gather [them] together.
34Nah 3:19 There is no remedy for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news about you will clap their hands because of you, for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?

35Hab 1:1 The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
35Hab 1:2 How long, LORD, must I call for help and You do not listen, or cry out to You about violence and You do not save?
35Hab 1:3 Why do You force me to look at injustice? Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? Oppression and violence are right in front of me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict escalates.
35Hab 1:4 This is why the law is ineffective and justice never emerges. For the wicked restrict the righteous; therefore, justice comes out perverted.
35Hab 1:5 Look at the nations and observe-- be utterly astounded! For something is taking place in your days that you will not believe when you hear about it.
35Hab 1:6 Look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter, impetuous nation that marches across the earth's open spaces to seize territories not its own.
35Hab 1:7 They are fierce and terrifying; their views of justice and sovereignty stem from themselves.
35Hab 1:8 Their horses are swifter than leopards and more fierce than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead; their horsemen come from distant [lands]. They fly like an eagle, swooping to devour.
35Hab 1:9 All of them come to do violence; their faces are set in determination. They gather prisoners like sand.
35Hab 1:10 They mock kings, and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortress and build siege ramps to capture it.
35Hab 1:11 Then they sweep by like the wind and pass through. They are guilty; their strength is their god.
35Hab 1:12 Are You not from eternity, Yahweh my God? My Holy One, You will not die. LORD, You appointed them to execute judgment; [my] Rock, You destined them to punish [us].
35Hab 1:13 [Your] eyes are too pure to look on evil, and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate those who are treacherous? Why are You silent while one who is wicked swallows up one who is more righteous than himself?
35Hab 1:14 You have made mankind like the fish of the sea, like marine creatures that have no ruler.
35Hab 1:15 The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook, catch them in their dragnet, and gather them in their fishing net; that is why they are glad and rejoice.
35Hab 1:16 That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet and burn incense to their fishing net, for by these things their portion is rich and their food plentiful.
35Hab 1:17 Will they therefore empty their net and continually slaughter nations without mercy?
35Hab 2:1 I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the lookout tower. I will watch to see what He will say to me and what I should reply about my complaint.
35Hab 2:2 The LORD answered me: Write down this vision; clearly inscribe it on tablets so one may easily read it.
35Hab 2:3 For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it testifies about the end and will not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, since it will certainly come and not be late.
35Hab 2:4 Look, his ego is inflated; he is without integrity. But the righteous one will live by his faith.
35Hab 2:5 Moreover, wine betrays; an arrogant man is never at rest. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, and like Death he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations to himself; he collects all the peoples for himself.
35Hab 2:6 Won't all of these take up a taunt against him, with mockery and riddles about him? They will say: Woe to him who amasses what is not his-- how much longer?-- and loads himself with goods taken in pledge.
35Hab 2:7 Won't your creditors suddenly arise, and those who disturb you wake up? Then you will become spoil for them.
35Hab 2:8 Since you have plundered many nations, all the peoples who remain will plunder you-- because of human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them.
35Hab 2:9 Woe to him who unjustly gains wealth for his house to place his nest on high, to escape from the reach of disaster!
35Hab 2:10 You have planned shame for your house by wiping out many peoples and sinning against your own self.
35Hab 2:11 For the stones will cry out from the wall, and the rafters will answer them from the woodwork.
35Hab 2:12 Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and founds a town with injustice!
35Hab 2:13 Is it not from the LORD of Hosts, that the peoples labor [only] to fuel the fire and countries exhaust themselves for nothing?
35Hab 2:14 For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD's glory, as the waters cover the sea.
35Hab 2:15 Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink, pouring out your wrath and even making them drunk, in order to look at their nakedness!
35Hab 2:16 You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory. You also-- drink, and expose your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD's right hand will come around to you, and utter disgrace will cover your glory.
35Hab 2:17 For [your] violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you; the destruction of animals will terrify you, because of [your] human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them.
35Hab 2:18 What use is a carved idol after its craftsman carves it? It is [only] a cast image, a teacher of lies. For the one who crafts its shape trusts in it and makes idols that cannot speak.
35Hab 2:19 Woe to him who says to wood: Wake up! or to mute stone: Come alive! Can it teach? Look! It may be plated with gold and silver, yet there is no breath in it at all.
35Hab 2:20 But the LORD is in His holy temple; let everyone on earth be silent in His presence.
35Hab 3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. According to Shigionoth.
35Hab 3:2 LORD, I have heard the report about You; LORD, I stand in awe of Your deeds. Revive [Your work] in these years; make [it] known in these years. In [Your] wrath remember mercy!
35Hab 3:3 God comes from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His splendor covers the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise.
35Hab 3:4 [His] brilliance is like light; rays are flashing from His hand. This is where His power is hidden.
35Hab 3:5 Plague goes before Him, and pestilence follows in His steps.
35Hab 3:6 He stands and shakes the earth; He looks and startles the nations. The age-old mountains break apart; the ancient hills sink down. His pathways are ancient.
35Hab 3:7 I see the tents of Cushan in distress; the tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.
35Hab 3:8 Are You angry at the rivers, LORD? Is Your wrath against the rivers? Or is Your rage against the sea when You ride on Your horses, Your victorious chariot?
35Hab 3:9 You took the sheath from Your bow; the arrows are ready to be used with an oath. Selah You split the earth with rivers.
35Hab 3:10 The mountains see You and shudder; a downpour of water sweeps by. The deep roars with its voice and lifts its waves high.
35Hab 3:11 Sun and moon stand still in [their] lofty residence, at the flash of Your flying arrows, at the brightness of Your shining spear.
35Hab 3:12 You march across the earth with indignation; You trample down the nations in wrath.
35Hab 3:13 You come out to save Your people, to save Your anointed. You crush the leader of the house of the wicked and strip [him] from foot to neck. Selah
35Hab 3:14 You pierce his head with his own spears; his warriors storm out to scatter us, gloating as if ready to secretly devour the weak.
35Hab 3:15 You tread the sea with Your horses, stirring up the great waters.
35Hab 3:16 I heard, and I trembled within; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered my bones; I trembled where I stood. Now I must quietly wait for the day of distress to come against the people invading us.
35Hab 3:17 Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no fruit on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,
35Hab 3:18 yet I will triumph in the LORD; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation!
35Hab 3:19 Yahweh my Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer and enables me to walk on mountain heights! [For the choir director: on stringed instruments.]

36Zph 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.
36Zph 1:2 I will completely sweep away everything from the face of the earth-- [this is] the LORD's declaration.
36Zph 1:3 I will sweep away man and animal; I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and the ruins along with the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth-- the LORD's declaration.
36Zph 1:4 I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all the residents of Jerusalem. I will cut off from this place every vestige of Baal, the names of the pagan priests along with the priests;
36Zph 1:5 those who bow in worship on the rooftops to the heavenly host; those who bow and pledge loyalty to the LORD but also pledge loyalty to Milcom;
36Zph 1:6 and those who turn back from following the LORD, who do not seek the LORD or inquire of Him.
36Zph 1:7 Be silent in the presence of the Lord God, for the Day of the LORD is near. Indeed, the LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests.
36Zph 1:8 On the day of the LORD's sacrifice I will punish the officials, the king's sons, and all who are dressed in foreign clothing.
36Zph 1:9 On that day I will punish all who skip over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.
36Zph 1:10 On that day-- the LORD's declaration-- there will be an outcry from the Fish Gate, a wailing from the Second District, and a loud crashing from the hills.
36Zph 1:11 Wail, you residents of the Hollow, for all the merchants will be silenced; all those loaded with silver will be cut off.
36Zph 1:12 And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men who settle down comfortably, who say to themselves: The LORD will not do good or evil.
36Zph 1:13 Their wealth will become plunder and their houses a ruin. They will build houses but never live [in them], plant vineyards but never drink their wine.
36Zph 1:14 The great Day of the LORD is near, near and rapidly approaching. Listen, the Day of the LORD-- there the warrior's cry is bitter.
36Zph 1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,
36Zph 1:16 a day of trumpet [blast] and battle cry against the fortified cities, and against the high corner towers.
36Zph 1:17 I will bring distress on mankind, and they will walk like the blind because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their flesh like dung.
36Zph 1:18 Their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the LORD's wrath. The whole earth will be consumed by the fire of His jealousy. For He will make a complete, yes, a horrifying end of all the inhabitants of the earth.
36Zph 2:1 Gather yourselves together; gather together, undesirable nation,
36Zph 2:2 before the decree takes effect and the day passes like chaff, before the burning of the LORD's anger overtakes you, before the day of the LORD's anger overtakes you.
36Zph 2:3 Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth, who carry out what He commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be concealed on the day of the LORD's anger.
36Zph 2:4 For Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon will become a ruin. Ashdod will be driven out at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
36Zph 2:5 Woe, inhabitants of the seacoast, nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy you until there is no one left.
36Zph 2:6 The seacoast will become pasturelands with caves for shepherds and folds for sheep.
36Zph 2:7 The coastland will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah; they will find pasture there. They will lie down in the evening among the houses of Ashkelon, for the LORD their God will return to them and restore their fortunes.
36Zph 2:8 I have heard the taunting of Moab and the insults of the Ammonites, who have taunted My people and threatened their territory.
36Zph 2:9 Therefore, as I live-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel-- Moab will be like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah-- a place overgrown with weeds, a salt pit, and a perpetual wasteland. The remnant of My people will plunder them; the remainder of My nation will dispossess them.
36Zph 2:10 This is what they get for their pride, because they have taunted and acted arrogantly against the people of the LORD of Hosts.
36Zph 2:11 The LORD will be terrifying to them when He starves all the gods of the earth. Then all the distant coastlands of the nations will bow in worship to Him, each in its own place.
36Zph 2:12 You Cushites will also be slain by My sword.
36Zph 2:13 He will also stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolate ruin, dry as the desert.
36Zph 2:14 Herds will lie down in the middle of it, every kind of wild animal. Both the desert owl and the screech owl will roost in the capitals of its pillars. [Their] calls will sound from the window, but devastation will be on the threshold, for He will expose the cedar work.
36Zph 2:15 This is the self-assured city that lives in security, that thinks to herself: I am, and there is no one besides me. What a desolation she has become, a place for wild animals to lie down! Everyone who passes by her jeers and shakes his fist.
36Zph 3:1 Woe to the city that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressive city!
36Zph 3:2 She has not obeyed; she has not accepted discipline. She has not trusted in the LORD; she has not drawn near to her God.
36Zph 3:3 The princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the night, which leave nothing for the morning.
36Zph 3:4 Her prophets are reckless-- treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to instruction.
36Zph 3:5 The righteous LORD is in her; He does no wrong. He applies His justice morning by morning; He does not fail at dawn, yet the one who does wrong knows no shame.
36Zph 3:6 I have cut off nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have laid waste their streets, with no one to pass through. Their cities lie devastated, without a person, without an inhabitant.
36Zph 3:7 I thought: You will certainly fear Me and accept correction. Then her dwelling place would not be cut off [based on] all that I had allocated to her. However, they became more corrupt in all their actions.
36Zph 3:8 Therefore, wait for Me-- the LORD's declaration-- until the day I rise up for plunder. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, in order to pour out My indignation on them, all My burning anger; for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of My jealousy.
36Zph 3:9 For I will then restore pure speech to the peoples so that all of them may call on the name of Yahweh and serve Him with a single purpose.
36Zph 3:10 From beyond the rivers of Cush My supplicants, My dispersed people, will bring an offering to Me.
36Zph 3:11 On that day you will not be put to shame because of everything you have done in rebelling against Me. For then I will remove your boastful braggarts from among you, and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain.
36Zph 3:12 I will leave a meek and humble people among you, and they will trust in the name of Yahweh.
36Zph 3:13 The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. But they will pasture and lie down, with nothing to make [them] afraid.
36Zph 3:14 Sing for joy, Daughter Zion; shout loudly, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all [your] heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
36Zph 3:15 The LORD has removed your punishment; He has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, the LORD, is among you; you need no longer fear harm.
36Zph 3:16 On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear; Zion, do not let your hands grow weak.
36Zph 3:17 The LORD your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will bring [you] quietness with His love. He will delight in you with shouts of joy."
36Zph 3:18 I will gather those who have been driven from the appointed festivals; [They will be] a tribute from you, and reproach [on her].
36Zph 3:19 Yes, at that time I will deal with all who afflict you. I will save the lame and gather the scattered; I will make those who were disgraced throughout the earth receive praise and fame.
36Zph 3:20 At that time I will bring you back, yes, at the time I will gather you. I will make you famous and praiseworthy among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes. Yahweh has spoken.

37Hg 1:1 In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:
37Hg 1:2 "The LORD of Hosts says this: These people say: The time has not come for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt."
37Hg 1:3 The word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet:
37Hg 1:4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?"
37Hg 1:5 Now, the LORD of Hosts says this: "Think carefully about your ways:
37Hg 1:6 You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough to be satisfied. You drink but never have enough to become drunk. You put on clothes but never have enough to get warm. The wage earner [puts his] wages into a bag with a hole in it."
37Hg 1:7 The LORD of Hosts says this: "Think carefully about your ways.
37Hg 1:8 Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house. Then I will be pleased with it and be glorified," says the LORD.
37Hg 1:9 "You expected much, but then it amounted to little. When you brought [the harvest] to your house, I ruined it. Why?" [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. "Because My house still lies in ruins, while each of you is busy with his own house.
37Hg 1:10 So on your account, the skies have withheld the dew and the land its crops.
37Hg 1:11 I have summoned a drought on the fields and the hills, on the grain, new wine, olive oil, and whatever the ground yields, on the people and animals, and on all that your hands produce."
37Hg 1:12 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the entire remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD.
37Hg 1:13 Haggai, the LORD's messenger, delivered the LORD's message to the people, "I am with you"-- the LORD's declaration.
37Hg 1:14 The LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. They began work on the house of Yahweh of Hosts, their God,
37Hg 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
37Hg 2:1 On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet:
37Hg 2:2 "Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people:
37Hg 2:3 Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Doesn't it seem like nothing to you?
37Hg 2:4 Even so, be strong, Zerubbabel"-- the LORD's declaration. "Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land"-- the LORD's declaration. "Work! For I am with you"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
37Hg 2:5 "[This is] the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt, and My Spirit is present among you; don't be afraid."
37Hg 2:6 For the LORD of Hosts says this: "Once more, in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
37Hg 2:7 I will shake all the nations so that the treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory," says the LORD of Hosts.
37Hg 2:8 "The silver and gold belong to Me"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
37Hg 2:9 "The final glory of this house will be greater than the first," says the LORD of Hosts. "I will provide peace in this place"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
37Hg 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet:
37Hg 2:11 "This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Ask the priests for a ruling.
37Hg 2:12 If a man is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy?" The priests answered, "No."
37Hg 2:13 Then Haggai asked, "If someone defiled by [contact with] a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?" The priests answered, "It becomes defiled."
37Hg 2:14 Then Haggai replied, "So is this people, and so is this nation before Me"-- the LORD's declaration. "And so is every work of their hands; even what they offer there is defiled.
37Hg 2:15 "Now, reflect back from this day: Before one stone was placed on another in the LORD's temple,
37Hg 2:16 what state were you in? When someone came to a [grain] heap of 20 measures, it [only] amounted to 10; when one came to the winepress to dip 50 measures from the vat, it [only] amounted to 20.
37Hg 2:17 I struck you-- all the work of your hands-- with blight, mildew, and hail, but you didn't turn to Me"-- the LORD's declaration.
37Hg 2:18 "Consider carefully from this day forward; from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid; consider it carefully.
37Hg 2:19 Is there still seed left in the granary? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet produced. But from this day on I will bless you."
37Hg 2:20 The word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
37Hg 2:21 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
37Hg 2:22 I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the Gentile kingdoms. I will overturn chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders will fall, each by his brother's sword.
37Hg 2:23 On that day"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, My servant"-- the LORD's declaration-- "and make you like My signet ring, for I have chosen you." [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.

38Zch 1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:
38Zch 1:2 "The LORD was extremely angry with your ancestors.
38Zch 1:3 So tell the people: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Return to Me"-- [this is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 1:4 Do not be like your ancestors; the earlier prophets proclaimed to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Turn from your evil ways and your evil deeds. But they did not listen or pay attention to Me"-- the LORD's declaration.
38Zch 1:5 "Where are your ancestors now? And do the prophets live forever?
38Zch 1:6 But didn't My words and My statutes that I commanded My servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? They repented and said: As the LORD of Hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so He has dealt with us."
38Zch 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:
38Zch 1:8 I looked out in the night and saw a man riding on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in the valley. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
38Zch 1:9 I asked, "What are these, my lord?" The angel who was talking to me replied, "I will show you what they are."
38Zch 1:10 Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, "They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."
38Zch 1:11 They reported to the Angel of the LORD standing among the myrtle trees, "We have patrolled the earth, and right now the whole earth is calm and quiet."
38Zch 1:12 Then the Angel of the LORD responded, "How long, LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that You have been angry with these 70 years?"
38Zch 1:13 The LORD replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
38Zch 1:14 So the angel who was speaking with me said, "Proclaim: The LORD of Hosts says: I am extremely jealous for Jerusalem and Zion.
38Zch 1:15 I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease, for I was a little angry, but they made it worse.
38Zch 1:16 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I have graciously returned to Jerusalem; My house will be rebuilt within it"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.
38Zch 1:17 "Proclaim further: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: My cities will again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will once more comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:18  Then I looked up and saw four horns.
38Zch 1:19 So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?" And he said to me, "These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
38Zch 1:21 I asked, "What are they coming to do?" He replied, "These are the horns that scattered Judah so no one could raise his head. These [craftsmen] have come to terrify them, to cut off the horns of the nations that raised [their] horns against the land of Judah to scatter it."
38Zch 2:1  I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38Zch 2:2 I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem to determine its width and length."
38Zch 2:3 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him.
38Zch 2:4 He said to him, "Run and tell this young man: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the number of people and livestock in it."
38Zch 2:5 The declaration of the LORD: "I will be a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory within it."
38Zch 2:6 "Get up! Leave the land of the north"-- the LORD's declaration-- "for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven"-- the LORD's declaration.
38Zch 2:7 "Go, Zion! Escape, you who are living with Daughter Babylon."
38Zch 2:8 For the LORD of Hosts says this: "He has sent Me for [His] glory against the nations who are plundering you, for anyone who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.
38Zch 2:9 I will move against them with My power, and they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.
38Zch 2:10 "Daughter Zion, shout for joy and be glad, for I am coming to dwell among you"-- the LORD's declaration.
38Zch 2:11 "Many nations will join themselves to the LORD on that day and become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.
38Zch 2:12 The LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem.
38Zch 2:13 Let all people be silent before the LORD, for He is coming from His holy dwelling."
38Zch 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
38Zch 3:2 The LORD said to Satan: "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! May the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn't this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?"
38Zch 3:3 Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood before the Angel.
38Zch 3:4 So He spoke to those standing before Him, "Take off his filthy clothes!" Then He said to him, "See, I have removed your guilt from you, and I will clothe you with splendid robes."
38Zch 3:5 Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him in garments while the Angel of the LORD was standing nearby.
38Zch 3:6 Then the Angel of the LORD charged Joshua:
38Zch 3:7 "This is what the LORD of Hosts says: If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, you will both rule My house and take care of My courts; I will also grant you access among these who are standing here.
38Zch 3:8 "Listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your colleagues sitting before you; indeed, these men are a sign that I am about to bring My servant, the Branch.
38Zch 3:9 Notice the stone I have set before Joshua; on [that] one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave an inscription on it"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "and I will take away the guilt of this land in a single day.
38Zch 3:10 On that day, each of you will invite his neighbor to [sit] under [his] vine and fig tree." [This is] the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 4:1 The angel who was speaking with me then returned and roused me as one awakened out of sleep.
38Zch 4:2 He asked me, "What do you see?" I replied, "I see a solid gold lampstand there with a bowl on its top. It has seven lamps on it and seven channels for each of the lamps on its top.
38Zch 4:3 There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left."
38Zch 4:4 Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 4:5 "Don't you know what they are?" replied the angel who was speaking with me. I said, "No, my lord."
38Zch 4:6 So he answered me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 4:7 'What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!'"
38Zch 4:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me:
38Zch 4:9 "Zerubbabel's hands have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.
38Zch 4:10 For who scorns the day of small things? These seven eyes of the LORD, which scan throughout the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line in Zerubbabel's hand."
38Zch 4:11 I asked him, "What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?"
38Zch 4:12 And I questioned him further, "What are the two olive branches beside the two gold conduits, from which golden [oil] pours out?"
38Zch 4:13 Then he inquired of me, "Don't you know what these are?" "No, my lord," I replied.
38Zch 4:14 "These are the two anointed ones," he said, "who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38Zch 5:1 I looked up again and saw a flying scroll.
38Zch 5:2 "What do you see?" he asked me. "I see a flying scroll," I replied, "30 feet long and 15 feet wide."
38Zch 5:3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going out over the whole land, for every thief will be removed according to what is written on one side, and everyone who swears [falsely] will be removed according to what is written on the other side.
38Zch 5:4 I will send it out,"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. It will stay inside his house and destroy it along with its timbers and stones."
38Zch 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and told me, "Look up and see what this is that is approaching."
38Zch 5:6 So I asked, "What is it?" He responded, "It's a measuring basket that is approaching." And he continued, "This is their iniquity in all the land."
38Zch 5:7 Then a lead cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.
38Zch 5:8 "This is Wickedness," he said. He shoved her down into the basket and pushed the lead weight over its opening.
38Zch 5:9 Then I looked up and saw two women approaching with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and sky.
38Zch 5:10 So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the basket?"
38Zch 5:11 "To build a shrine for it in the land of Shinar," he told me. "When that is ready, [the basket] will be placed there on its pedestal."
38Zch 6:1 Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains. And the mountains were made of bronze.
38Zch 6:2 The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot black horses,
38Zch 6:3 the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses-- [all] strong horses.
38Zch 6:4 So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38Zch 6:5 The angel told me, "These are the four spiritsof heaven going out after presenting themselves to the Lord of the whole earth.
38Zch 6:6 The one with the black horses is going to the land of the north, the white horses are going after them, but the dappled horses are going to the land of the south."
38Zch 6:7 As the strong horses went out, they wanted to go patrol the earth, and the LORD said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
38Zch 6:8 Then He summoned me saying, "See, those going to the land of the north have pacified My Spirit in the northern land."
38Zch 6:9 The word of the LORD came to me:
38Zch 6:10 "Take [an offering] from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
38Zch 6:11 Take silver and gold, make crowns and place them on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
38Zch 6:12 You are to tell him: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Here is a man whose name is Branch; He will branch out from His place and build the LORD's temple.
38Zch 6:13 Yes, He will build the LORD's temple; He will be clothed in splendor and will sit on His throne and rule. There will also be a priest on His throne, and there will be peaceful counsel between the two of them.
38Zch 6:14 The crown will reside in the LORD's temple as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah.
38Zch 6:15 People who are far off will come and build the LORD's temple, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you. This will happen when you fully obey the LORD your God."
38Zch 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
38Zch 7:2 Now [the people of] Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to plead for the LORD's favor
38Zch 7:3 by asking the priests who were at the house of the LORD of Hosts as well as the prophets, "Should we mourn and fast in the fifth month as we have done these many years?"
38Zch 7:4 Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me:
38Zch 7:5 "Ask all the people of the land and the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh [months] for these 70 years, did you really fast for Me?
38Zch 7:6 When you eat and drink, don't you eat and drink [simply] for yourselves?
38Zch 7:7 Aren't [these] the words that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and secure, along with its surrounding cities, and when the southern region and the Judean foothills were inhabited?"
38Zch 7:8 The word of the LORD came to Zechariah:
38Zch 7:9 "The LORD of Hosts says this: Render true justice. Show faithful love and compassion to one another.
38Zch 7:10 Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the stranger or the poor, and do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.
38Zch 7:11 But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder; they closed their ears so they could not hear.
38Zch 7:12 They made their hearts like a rock so as not to obey the law or the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 7:13 Just as He had called, and they would not listen, so when they called, I would not listen," says the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 7:14 "I scattered them with a windstorm over all the nations that had not known them, and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one coming or going. They turned a pleasant land into a desolation."
38Zch 8:1 The word of the LORD of Hosts came:
38Zch 8:2 "The LORD of Hosts says this: I am extremely jealous for Zion; I am jealous for her with great wrath."
38Zch 8:3 The LORD says this: "I will return to Zion and live in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, the mountain of the LORD of Hosts, and the Holy Mountain."
38Zch 8:4 The LORD of Hosts says this: "Old men and women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of advanced age.
38Zch 8:5 The streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in them."
38Zch 8:6 The LORD of Hosts says this: "Though it may seem incredible to the remnant of this people in those days, should it also seem incredible to Me?"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 8:7 The LORD of Hosts says this: "I will save My people from the land of the east and the land of the west.
38Zch 8:8 I will bring them [back] to live in Jerusalem. They will be My people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God."
38Zch 8:9 The LORD of Hosts says this: "Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words that the prophets spoke when the foundations were laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 8:10 For prior to those days neither man nor beast had wages. There was no safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I turned everyone against his neighbor.
38Zch 8:11 But now, I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
38Zch 8:12 "For they will sow in peace: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the skies will yield their dew. I will give the remnant of this people all these things as an inheritance.
38Zch 8:13 As you have been a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Don't be afraid; let your hands be strong."
38Zch 8:14 For the LORD of Hosts says this: "As I resolved to treat you badly when your fathers provoked Me to anger, and would not relent," says the LORD of Hosts,
38Zch 8:15 "so I have resolved again in these days to do what is good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Don't be afraid.
38Zch 8:16 These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another; render honest and peaceful judgments in your gates.
38Zch 8:17 Do not plot evil in your hearts against your neighbor, and do not love perjury, for I hate all this"-- the LORD's declaration.
38Zch 8:18 Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me:
38Zch 8:19 "The LORD of Hosts says this: The fast of the fourth [month], the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will become times of joy, gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace."
38Zch 8:20 The LORD of Hosts says this: "Peoples will yet come, the residents of many cities;
38Zch 8:21 the residents of one city will go to another, saying: Let's go at once to plead for the LORD's favor and to seek the LORD of Hosts. I am also going.
38Zch 8:22 Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem and to plead for the LORD's favor."
38Zch 8:23 The LORD of Hosts says this: "In those days, 10 men from nations of every language will grab the robe of a Jewish man tightly, urging: Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."
38Zch 9:1 An Oracle The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, and Damascus is its resting place-- for the eyes of men are on the LORD-- against all the tribes of Israel
38Zch 9:2 and also against Hamath, which borders it, as well as Tyre and Sidon, though they are very shrewd.
38Zch 9:3 Tyre has built herself a fortress; she has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.
38Zch 9:4 Listen! The Lord will impoverish her and cast her wealth into the sea; she herself will be consumed by fire.
38Zch 9:5 Ashkelon will see it and be afraid; Gaza too, and will writhe in great pain, as will Ekron, for her hope will fail. There will cease to be a king in Gaza, and Ashkelon will become uninhabited.
38Zch 9:6 A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.
38Zch 9:7 I will remove the blood from their mouths and the detestable things from between their teeth. Then they too will become a remnant for our God; they will become like a clan in Judah and Ekron like the Jebusites.
38Zch 9:8 I will set up camp at My house against an army, against those who march back and forth, and no oppressor will march against them again, for now I have seen with My own eyes.
38Zch 9:9 Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your King is coming to you; He is righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38Zch 9:10 I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. The bow of war will be removed, and He will proclaim peace to the nations. His dominion will extend from sea to sea, from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.
38Zch 9:11 As for you, because of the blood of your covenant, I will release your prisoners from the waterless cistern.
38Zch 9:12 Return to a stronghold, you prisoners who have hope; today I declare that I will restore double to you.
38Zch 9:13 For I will bend Judah [as My bow]; I will fill that bow with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece. I will make you like a warrior's sword.
38Zch 9:14 Then the LORD will appear over them, and His arrow will fly like lightning. The Lord God will sound the trumpet and advance with the southern storms.
38Zch 9:15 The LORD of Hosts will defend them. They will consume and conquer with slingstones; they will drink and be rowdy as if with wine. They will be as full as the sprinkling basin, like [those] at the corners of the altar.
38Zch 9:16 The LORD their God will save them on that day as the flock of His people; for they are like jewels in a crown, sparkling over His land.
38Zch 9:17 How lovely and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine, the young women.
38Zch 10:1 Ask the LORD for rain in the season of spring rain. The LORD makes the rain clouds, and He will give them showers of rain and crops in the field for everyone.
38Zch 10:2 For the idols speak falsehood, and the diviners see illusions; they relate empty dreams and offer empty comfort. Therefore [the people] wander like sheep; they suffer affliction because there is no shepherd.
38Zch 10:3 My anger burns against the shepherds, so I will punish the leaders. For the LORD of Hosts has tended His flock, the house of Judah; He will make them like His majestic steed in battle.
38Zch 10:4 From them will come the cornerstone, from them the tent peg, from them the battle bow, from them every ruler. Together
38Zch 10:5 they will be like warriors in battle trampling down the mud of the streets. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and they will put horsemen to shame.
38Zch 10:6 I will strengthen the house of Judah and deliver the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them, and they will be as though I had never rejected them. For I am the LORD their God, and I will answer them.
38Zch 10:7 Ephraim will be like a warrior, and their hearts will be glad as if with wine. Their children will see it and be glad; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.
38Zch 10:8 I will whistle and gather them because I have redeemed them; they will be as numerous as they once were.
38Zch 10:9 Though I sow them among the nations, they will remember Me in the distant lands; they and their children will live and return.
38Zch 10:10 I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, but it will not be enough for them.
38Zch 10:11 He will pass through the sea of distress and strike the waves of the sea; all the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will come to an end.
38Zch 10:12 I will strengthen them in the LORD, and they will march in His name-- [this is] Yahweh's declaration.
38Zch 11:1 Open your gates, Lebanon, and fire will consume your cedars.
38Zch 11:2 Wail, cypress, for the cedar has fallen; the glorious [trees] are destroyed! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the stately forest has fallen!
38Zch 11:3 Listen to the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. Listen to the roar of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed.
38Zch 11:4 The LORD my God says this: "Shepherd the flock intended for slaughter.
38Zch 11:5 Those who buy them slaughter them but are not punished. Those who sell them say: Praise the LORD because I have become rich! Even their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
38Zch 11:6 Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land"-- the LORD's declaration. "Instead, I will turn everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver [it] from them."
38Zch 11:7 So I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter, the afflicted of the flock. I took two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock.
38Zch 11:8 In one month I got rid of three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.
38Zch 11:9 Then I said, "I will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is going astray go astray; let the rest devour each other's flesh."
38Zch 11:10 Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples.
38Zch 11:11 It was annulled on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD.
38Zch 11:12 Then I said to them, "If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep [them]." So they weighed my wages, 30 pieces of silver.
38Zch 11:13 "Throw it to the potter," the LORD said to me-- this magnificent price I was valued by them. So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the house of the LORD, to the potter.
38Zch 11:14 Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
38Zch 11:15 The LORD also said to me: "Take the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38Zch 11:16 I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are going astray, and he will not seek the lost or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy, but he will devour the flesh of the fat [sheep] and tear off their hooves.
38Zch 11:17 Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! May a sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm wither away and his right eye go completely blind!"
38Zch 12:1 An Oracle The word of the LORD concerning Israel. A declaration of the LORD, who stretched out the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.
38Zch 12:2 "Look, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering for the peoples who surround the city. The siege against Jerusalem will also involve Judah.
38Zch 12:3 On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who try to lift it will injure themselves severely when all the nations of the earth gather against her.
38Zch 12:4 On that day"-- the LORD's declaration-- "I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah but strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.
38Zch 12:5 Then [each of] the leaders of Judah will think to himself: The residents of Jerusalem are my strength through the LORD of Hosts, their God.
38Zch 12:6 On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves; they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and the left, while Jerusalem continues to be inhabited on its site, in Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:7 The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of David's house and the glory of Jerusalem's residents may not be greater than that of Judah.
38Zch 12:8 On that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the one who is weakest among them will be like David on that day, and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of the LORD, before them.
38Zch 12:9 On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:10 "Then I will pour out a spiritof grace and prayer on the house of David and the residents of Jerusalem, and they will look at Me whom they pierced. They will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child and weep bitterly for Him as one weeps for a firstborn.
38Zch 12:11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38Zch 12:12 The land will mourn, every family by itself: the family of David's house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan's house by itself and their women by themselves;
38Zch 12:13 the family of Levi's house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself and their women by themselves;
38Zch 12:14 all the remaining families, every family by itself, and their women by themselves.
38Zch 13:1 "On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the residents of Jerusalem, [to wash away] sin and impurity.
38Zch 13:2 On that day"-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts-- "I will erase the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered. I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
38Zch 13:3 If a man still prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him: You cannot remain alive because you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD. When he prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through.
38Zch 13:4 On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive.
38Zch 13:5 He will say: I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the soil, for a man purchased me as a servant since my youth.
38Zch 13:6 If someone asks him: What are these wounds on your chest?-- then he will answer: The wounds I received in the house of my friends.
38Zch 13:7 Sword, awake against My shepherd, against the man who is My associate-- the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will also turn My hand against the little ones.
38Zch 13:8 In the whole land-- the LORD's declaration-- two-thirds will be cut off and die, but a third will be left in it.
38Zch 13:9 I will put this third through the fire; I will refine them as silver is refined and test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say: They are My people, and they will say: The LORD is our God."
38Zch 14:1 A day of the LORD is coming when your plunder will be divided in your presence.
38Zch 14:2 I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle. The city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women raped. Half the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.
38Zch 14:3 Then the LORD will go out to fight against those nations as He fights on a day of battle.
38Zch 14:4 On that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. The Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, forming a huge valley, so that half the mountain will move to the north and half to the south.
38Zch 14:5 You will flee by My mountain valley, for the valley of the mountains will extend to Azal. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come and all the holy ones with Him.
38Zch 14:6 On that day there will be no light; the sunlight and moonlight will diminish.
38Zch 14:7 It will be a day known [only] to Yahweh, without day or night, but there will be light at evening.
38Zch 14:8 On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea, in summer and winter alike.
38Zch 14:9 On that day Yahweh will become king over all the earth-- Yahweh alone, and His name alone.
38Zch 14:10 All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will be changed into a plain. But [Jerusalem] will be raised up and will remain on its site from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
38Zch 14:11 People will live there, and never again will there be a curse of destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell in security.
38Zch 14:12 This will be the plague the LORD strikes all the peoples with, who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
38Zch 14:13 On that day a great panic from the LORD will be among them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will rise against the other.
38Zch 14:14 Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected: gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.
38Zch 14:15 The same plague as the previous one will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals that are in those camps.
38Zch 14:16 Then all the survivors from the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, and to celebrate the Festival of Booths.
38Zch 14:17 Should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, rain will not fall on them.
38Zch 14:18 And if the people of Egypt will not go up and enter, then rain will not fall on them; this will be the plague the LORD inflicts on the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Booths.
38Zch 14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt and all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Booths.
38Zch 14:20 On that day, [the words] HOLY TO THE LORD will be on the bells of the horses. The pots in the house of the LORD will be like the sprinkling basins before the altar.
38Zch 14:21 Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of Hosts. Everyone who sacrifices will come and take some of the pots to cook in. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of Hosts.

39Mal 1:1 An oracle: The word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.
39Mal 1:2 "I have loved you," says the LORD. But you ask: "How have You loved us?" "Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother?" [This is] the LORD's declaration. "Even so, I loved Jacob,
39Mal 1:3 but I hated Esau. I turned his mountains into a wasteland, and [gave] his inheritance to the desert jackals."
39Mal 1:4 Though Edom says: "We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins," the LORD of Hosts says this: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called a wicked country and the people the LORD has cursed forever.
39Mal 1:5 Your own eyes will see this, and you yourselves will say: The LORD is great, [even] beyond the borders of Israel.
39Mal 1:6 "A son honors [his] father, and a servant his master. But if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is [your] fear of Me? says the LORD of Hosts to you priests, who despise My name." Yet you ask: "How have we despised Your name?"
39Mal 1:7 "By presenting defiled food on My altar." You ask: "How have we defiled You?" When you say: "The LORD's table is contemptible."
39Mal 1:8 "When you present a blind [animal] for sacrifice, is it not wrong? And when you present a lame or sick [animal], is it not wrong? Bring it to your governor! Would he be pleased with you or show you favor?" asks the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 1:9 "And now ask for God's favor. Will He be gracious to us? [Since] this has come from your hands, will He show any of you favor?" asks the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 1:10 "I wish one of you would shut the [temple] doors, so you would no longer kindle a useless [fire on] My altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of Hosts, "and I will accept no offering from your hands.
39Mal 1:11 "For My name will be great among the nations, from the rising of the sun to its setting. Incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name in every place because My name will be great among the nations," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 1:12 But you are profaning itwhen you say: "The Lord's table is defiled, and its product, its food, is contemptible."
39Mal 1:13 You also say: "Look, what a nuisance!" "And you scorn it," says the LORD of Hosts. "You bring stolen, lame, or sick animals. You bring this as an offering! Am I to accept that from your hands?" asks the LORD.
39Mal 1:14 "The deceiver is cursed who has an [acceptable] male in his flock and makes a vow but sacrifices a defective [animal] to the Lord. For I am a great King," says the LORD of Hosts, "and My name will be feared among the nations.
39Mal 2:1 "Therefore, this decree is for you priests:
39Mal 2:2 If you don't listen, and if you don't take it to heart to honor My name," says the LORD of Hosts, "I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. In fact, I have already begun to curse them because you are not taking it to heart.
39Mal 2:3 "Look, I am going to rebuke your descendants, and I will spread animal waste over your faces, the waste from your festival sacrifices, and you will be taken away with it.
39Mal 2:4 Then you will know that I sent you this decree so My covenant with Levi may continue," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 2:5 "My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave these to him; it called for reverence, and he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.
39Mal 2:6 True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing wrong was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and fairness and turned many from sin.
39Mal 2:7 For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 2:8 "You, on the other hand, have turned from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have violated the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 2:9 "So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people because you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in [your] instruction."
39Mal 2:10 Don't all of us have one Father? Didn't one God create us? Why then do we act treacherously against one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
39Mal 2:11 Judah has acted treacherously, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the LORD's sanctuary, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
39Mal 2:12 To the man who does this, may the LORD cut off any descendants from the tents of Jacob, even if they present an offering to the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 2:13 And this is another thing you do: you cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning, because He no longer respects your offerings or receives [them] gladly from your hands.
39Mal 2:14 Yet you ask, "For what reason?" Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have acted treacherously against her, though she was your marriage partner and your wife by covenant.
39Mal 2:15 Didn't the one [God] make [us] with a remnant of His life-breath? And what does the One seek? A godly offspring. So watch yourselves carefully, and do not act treacherously against the wife of your youth.
39Mal 2:16 "If he hates and divorces [his wife]," says the LORD God of Israel, "he covers his garment with injustice," says the LORD of Hosts. Therefore, watch yourselves carefully, and do not act treacherously.
39Mal 2:17 You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you ask, "How have we wearied [Him]?" When you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the LORD's sight, and He is pleased with them," or "Where is the God of justice?"
39Mal 3:1 "See, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. Then the Lord you seek will suddenly come to His temple, the Messenger of the covenant you desire-- see, He is coming," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 3:2 But who can endure the day of His coming? And who will be able to stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner's fire and like cleansing lye.
39Mal 3:3 He will be like a refiner and purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.
39Mal 3:4 And the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will please the LORD as in days of old and years gone by.
39Mal 3:5 "I will come to you in judgment, and I will be ready to witness against sorcerers and adulterers; against those who swear falsely; against those who oppress the widow and the fatherless, and cheat the wage earner; and against those who deny [justice to] the foreigner. They do not fear Me," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 3:6 "Because I, Yahweh, have not changed, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.
39Mal 3:7 "Since the days of your fathers, you have turned from My statutes; you have not kept [them]. Return to Me, and I will return to you," says the LORD of Hosts. But you ask: "How can we return?"
39Mal 3:8 "Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me!" You ask: "How do we rob You?" "[By not making the payments] of 10 percent and the contributions.
39Mal 3:9 You are suffering under a curse, yet you-- the whole nation-- are [still] robbing Me.
39Mal 3:10 Bring the full 10 percent into the storehouse so that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this way," says the LORD of Hosts. "See if I will not open the floodgates of heaven and pour out a blessing for you without measure.
39Mal 3:11 I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not ruin the produce of your ground, and your vine in your field will not be barren," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 3:12 "Then all the nations will consider you fortunate, for you will be a delightful land," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 3:13 "Your words against Me are harsh," says the LORD. Yet you ask: "What have we spoken against You?"
39Mal 3:14 You have said: "It is useless to serve God. What have we gained by keeping His requirements and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?
39Mal 3:15 So now we consider the arrogant to be fortunate. Not only do those who commit wickedness prosper, they even test God and escape."
39Mal 3:16 At that time those who feared the LORD spoke to one another. The LORD took notice and listened. So a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who feared Yahweh and had high regard for His name.
39Mal 3:17 "They will be Mine," says the LORD of Hosts, "a special possession on the day I am preparing. I will have compassion on them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.
39Mal 3:18 So you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.
39Mal 4:1  "For indeed, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and everyone who commits wickedness will become stubble. The coming day will consume them," says the LORD of Hosts, "not leaving them root or branches.
39Mal 4:2 But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and playfully jump like calves from the stall.
39Mal 4:3 You will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing," says the LORD of Hosts.
39Mal 4:4 "Remember the instruction of Moses My servant, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.
39Mal 4:5 Look, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome Day of the LORD comes.
39Mal 4:6  And he will turn the hearts of fathers to [their] children and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse."
