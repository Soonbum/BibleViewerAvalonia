111Kg 1:1 Now King David was old and getting on in years. Although they covered him with bedclothes, he could not get warm.
111Kg 1:2 So his servants said to him: "Let us search for a young virgin for my lord the king. She is to attend the king and be his caregiver. She is to lie by your side so that my lord the king will get warm."
111Kg 1:3 They searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel; they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
111Kg 1:4 The girl was of unsurpassed beauty, and she became the king's caregiver. She served him, but he was not intimate with her.
111Kg 1:5 Adonijah son of Haggith kept exalting himself, saying, "I will be king!" He also assembled chariots, cavalry, and 50 men to run ahead of him.
111Kg 1:6 But his father had never once reprimanded him by saying, "Why do you act this way?" In addition, he was quite handsome and was born after Absalom.
111Kg 1:7 He conspired with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest. They supported Adonijah,
111Kg 1:8 but Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's warriors did not side with Adonijah.
111Kg 1:9 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king,
111Kg 1:10 but he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the warriors, or his brother Solomon.
111Kg 1:11 Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know [it]?
111Kg 1:12 Now please come and let me advise you. Save your life and the life of your son Solomon.
111Kg 1:13 Go, approach King David and say to him, 'My lord king, did you not swear to your servant: Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne? So why has Adonijah become king?'
111Kg 1:14 At that moment, while you are still there speaking with the king, I'll come in after you and confirm your words."
111Kg 1:15 So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
111Kg 1:16 Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king, and he asked, "What do you want?"
111Kg 1:17 She replied, "My lord, you swore to your servant by the LORD your God, 'Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne.'
111Kg 1:18 Now look, Adonijah has become king. And, my lord king, you didn't know [it].
111Kg 1:19 He has lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he did not invite your servant Solomon.
111Kg 1:20 Now, my lord king, the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
111Kg 1:21 Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be regarded as criminals."
111Kg 1:22 At that moment, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived,
111Kg 1:23 and it was announced to the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." He came into the king's presence and bowed to him with his face to the ground.
111Kg 1:24 "My lord king," Nathan said, "did you say, 'Adonijah is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne?'
111Kg 1:25 For today he went down and lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And look! They're eating and drinking in his presence, and they're saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
111Kg 1:26 But he did not invite me-- me, your servant-- or Zadok the priest or Benaiah son of Jehoiada or your servant Solomon.
111Kg 1:27 I'm certain my lord the king would not have let this happen without letting your servant know who will sit on my lord the king's throne after him."
111Kg 1:28 King David responded by saying, "Call in Bathsheba for me." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.
111Kg 1:29 The king swore an oath and said, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from every difficulty,
111Kg 1:30 just as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel: Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne in my place, that is exactly what I will do this very day."
111Kg 1:31 Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, paying homage to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
111Kg 1:32 King David then said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada for me." So they came into the king's presence.
111Kg 1:33 The king said to them, "Take my servants with you, have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.
111Kg 1:34 There, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him as king over Israel. You are to blow the ram's horn and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'
111Kg 1:35 You are to come up after him, and he is to come in and sit on my throne. He is the one who is to become king in my place; he is the one I have commanded to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
111Kg 1:36 " Amen," Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied to the king. "May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so affirm it.
111Kg 1:37 Just as the LORD was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."
111Kg 1:38 Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down, had Solomon ride on King David's mule, and took him to Gihon.
111Kg 1:39 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram's horn, and all the people proclaimed, "Long live King Solomon!"
111Kg 1:40 All the people followed him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth split open from the sound.
111Kg 1:41 Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard [the noise] as they finished eating. Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn and said, "Why is the town in such an uproar?"
111Kg 1:42 He was still speaking when Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest, suddenly arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are an excellent man, and you must be bringing good news."
111Kg 1:43 "Unfortunately not," Jonathan answered him. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
111Kg 1:44 And with Solomon, the king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have had him ride on the king's mule.
111Kg 1:45 Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have gone from there rejoicing. The town has been in an uproar; that's the noise you heard.
111Kg 1:46 Solomon has even taken his seat on the royal throne.
111Kg 1:47 "The king's servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.' Then the king bowed in worship on his bed.
111Kg 1:48 And the king went on to say this: 'May the LORD God of Israel be praised! Today He has provided one to sit on my throne, and I am a witness.'"
111Kg 1:49 Then all of Adonijah's guests got up trembling and went their separate ways.
111Kg 1:50 Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar.
111Kg 1:51 It was reported to Solomon: "Look, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon first swear to me that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'"
111Kg 1:52 Then Solomon said, "If he is a man of character, then not a single hair of his will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, then he dies."
111Kg 1:53 So King Solomon sent for him, and they took him down from the altar. He came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your home."
111Kg 2:1 As the time approached for David to die, he instructed his son Solomon,
111Kg 2:2 "As for me, I am going the way of all of the earth. Be strong and brave,
111Kg 2:3 and keep your obligation to the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commandments, judgments, and testimonies. This is written in the law of Moses, so that you will have success in everything you do and wherever you turn,
111Kg 2:4 and so that the LORD will carry out His promise that He made to me: 'If your sons are careful to walk faithfully before Me with their whole mind and heart, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 2:5 "You also know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two commanders of Israel's army, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He murdered them [in a time] of peace to avenge blood shed in war. He spilled that blood on his own waistband and on the sandals of his feet.
111Kg 2:6 Act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head descend to Sheol in peace.
111Kg 2:7 "Show loyalty to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table because they supported me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
111Kg 2:8 "Keep an eye on Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim who is with you. He uttered malicious curses against me the day I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, and I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will never kill you with the sword.'
111Kg 2:9 So don't let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man. You know how to deal with him to bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood."
111Kg 2:10 Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
111Kg 2:11 The [length of] time David reigned over Israel was 40 years: he reigned seven years in Hebron and 33 years in Jerusalem.
111Kg 2:12 Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingship was firmly established.
111Kg 2:13 Now Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked, "Do you come peacefully?" "Peacefully," he replied,
111Kg 2:14 and then asked, "May I talk with you?" "Go ahead," she answered.
111Kg 2:15 "You know the kingship was mine," he said. "All Israel expected me to be king, but then the kingship was turned over to my brother, for the LORD gave it to him.
111Kg 2:16 So now I have just one request of you; don't turn me down." She said to him, "Go on."
111Kg 2:17 He replied, "Please speak to King Solomon since he won't turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife."
111Kg 2:18 "Very well," Bathsheba replied. "I will speak to the king for you."
111Kg 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, sat down on his throne, and had a throne placed for the king's mother. So she sat down at his right hand.
111Kg 2:20 Then she said, "I have just one small request of you. Don't turn me down." "[Go ahead and] ask, mother," the king replied, "for I won't turn you down."
111Kg 2:21 So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife."
111Kg 2:22 King Solomon answered his mother, "Why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my elder brother, you might as well ask the kingship for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab son of Zeruiah."
111Kg 2:23 Then Solomon took an oath by the LORD: "May God punish me and do so severely if Adonijah has not made this request at the cost of his life.
111Kg 2:24 And now, as the LORD lives, the One who established me, seated me on the throne of my father David, and made me a dynasty as He promised-- I swear Adonijah will be put to death today!"
111Kg 2:25 Then King Solomon gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died.
111Kg 2:26 The king said to Abiathar the priest, "Go to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death today, since you carried the ark of the Lord God in the presence of my father David and you suffered through all that my father suffered."
111Kg 2:27 So Solomon banished Abiathar from being the LORD's priest, and it fulfilled the LORD's prophecy He had spoken at Shiloh against Eli's family.
111Kg 2:28 The news reached Joab. Since he had supported Adonijah but not Absalom, Joab fled to the LORD's tabernacle and took hold of the horns of the altar.
111Kg 2:29 It was reported to King Solomon: "Joab has fled to the LORD's tabernacle and is now beside the altar." Then Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada and told [him], "Go and strike him down!"
111Kg 2:30 So Benaiah went to the tabernacle and said to Joab, "This is what the king says: 'Come out!' " But Joab said, "No, for I will die here." So Benaiah took a message back to the king, "This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me."
111Kg 2:31 The king said to him, "Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him in order to remove from me and from my father's house the blood that Joab shed without just cause.
111Kg 2:32 The LORD will bring back his own blood on his own head because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he, without my father David's knowledge. With his sword, Joab murdered Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army.
111Kg 2:33 Their blood will come back on Joab's head and on the head of his descendants forever, but for David, his descendants, his dynasty, and his throne, there will be peace from the LORD forever."
111Kg 2:34 Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and put him to death. He was buried at his house in the wilderness.
111Kg 2:35 Then the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab's place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place.
111Kg 2:36 Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but don't leave there [and go] anywhere else.
111Kg 2:37 On the day you do leave and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will certainly die. Your blood will be on your own head."
111Kg 2:38 Shimei said to the king, "The sentence is fair; your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken." And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
111Kg 2:39 But then, at the end of three years, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. Shimei was informed, "Look, your slaves are in Gath."
111Kg 2:40 So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath to search for his slaves. He went and brought them back from Gath.
111Kg 2:41 It was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned.
111Kg 2:42 So the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Didn't I make you swear by the LORD and warn you, saying, 'On the day you leave and go anywhere else, know for sure that you will certainly die'? And you said to me, 'The sentence is fair; I will obey.'
111Kg 2:43 So why have you not kept the LORD's oath and the command that I gave you?"
111Kg 2:44 The king also said, "You yourself know all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore, the LORD has brought back your evil on your head,
111Kg 2:45 but King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain established before the LORD forever."
111Kg 2:46 Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in Solomon's hand.
111Kg 3:1 Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying Pharaoh's daughter. Solomon brought her to the city of David until he finished building his palace, the LORD's temple, and the wall surrounding Jerusalem.
111Kg 3:2 However, the people were sacrificing on the high places, because until that time a temple for the LORD's name had not been built.
111Kg 3:3 Solomon loved the LORD by walking in the statutes of his father David, but he also sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
111Kg 3:4 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there because it was the most famous high place. He offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar.
111Kg 3:5 At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night. God said, "Ask. What should I give you?"
111Kg 3:6 And Solomon replied, "You have shown great and faithful love to Your servant, my father David, because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and integrity. You have continued this great and faithful love for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.
111Kg 3:7 "LORD my God, You have now made Your servant king in my father David's place. Yet I am just a youth with no experience in leadership.
111Kg 3:8 Your servant is among Your people You have chosen, a people too numerous to be numbered or counted.
111Kg 3:9 So give Your servant an obedient heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?"
111Kg 3:10 Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had requested this.
111Kg 3:11 So God said to him, "Because you have requested this and did not ask for long life or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies, but you asked discernment for yourself to understand justice,
111Kg 3:12 I will therefore do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before and never will be again.
111Kg 3:13 In addition, I will give you what you did not ask for: both riches and honor, so that no man in any kingdom will be your equal during your entire life.
111Kg 3:14 If you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commandments just as your father David did, I will give you a long life."
111Kg 3:15 Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He went to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants.
111Kg 3:16 Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
111Kg 3:17 One woman said, "Please my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was in the house.
111Kg 3:18 On the third day after I gave birth, she also had a baby and we were alone. No one else was with us in the house; just the two of us were there.
111Kg 3:19 During the night this woman's son died because she lay on him.
111Kg 3:20 She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was asleep. She laid him at her breast, and she put her dead son in my arms.
111Kg 3:21 When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. That morning, when I looked closely at him I realized that he was not the son I gave birth to."
111Kg 3:22 "No," the other woman said. "My son is the living one; your son is the dead one." The first woman said, "No, your son is the dead one; my son is the living one." So they argued before the king.
111Kg 3:23 The king replied, "This woman says, 'This is my son who is alive, and your son is dead,' but that woman says, 'No, your son is dead, and my son is alive.'"
111Kg 3:24 The king continued, "Bring me a sword." So they brought the sword to the king.
111Kg 3:25 Solomon said, "Cut the living boy in two and give half to one and half to the other."
111Kg 3:26 The woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she felt great compassion for her son. "My lord, give her the living baby," she said, "but please don't have him killed!" But the other one said, "He will not be mine or yours. Cut [him in two]!"
111Kg 3:27 The king responded, "Give the living baby to the first woman, and don't kill him. She is his mother."
111Kg 3:28 All Israel heard about the judgment the king had given, and they stood in awe of the king because they saw that God's wisdom was in him to carry out justice.
111Kg 4:1 King Solomon ruled over Israel,
111Kg 4:2 and these were his officials: Azariah son of Zadok, priest;
111Kg 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha, secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud, historian;
111Kg 4:4 Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar, priests;
111Kg 4:5 Azariah son of Nathan, in charge of the deputies; Zabud son of Nathan, a priest and adviser to the king;
111Kg 4:6 Ahishar, in charge of the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda, in charge of forced labor.
111Kg 4:7 Solomon had 12 deputies for all Israel. They provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month out of the year.
111Kg 4:8 These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
111Kg 4:9 Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
111Kg 4:10 Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (he had Socoh and the whole land of Hepher);
111Kg 4:11 Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (Taphath daughter of Solomon was his wife);
111Kg 4:12 Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam;
111Kg 4:13 Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, 60 great cities with walls and bronze bars);
111Kg 4:14 Ahinadab son of Iddo, [in] Mahanaim;
111Kg 4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also had married a daughter of Solomon-- Basemath);
111Kg 4:16 Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
111Kg 4:17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar;
111Kg 4:18 Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin;
111Kg 4:19 Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. There was one deputy in the land of Judah.
111Kg 4:20 Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea; [they were] eating, drinking, and rejoicing.
111Kg 4:21  Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt. They offered tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
111Kg 4:22 Solomon's provisions for one day were 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of meal,
111Kg 4:23 10 fattened oxen, 20 range oxen, and 100 sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and pen-fed poultry,
111Kg 4:24 for he had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza and over all the kings west of the Euphrates. He had peace on all his surrounding borders.
111Kg 4:25 Throughout Solomon's [reign], Judah and Israel lived in safety from Dan to Beer-sheba, each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.
111Kg 4:26 Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.
111Kg 4:27 Each of those deputies for a month in turn provided food for King Solomon and for everyone who came to King Solomon's table. They neglected nothing.
111Kg 4:28 Each man brought the barley and the straw for the chariot teams and the other horses to the required place according to his assignment.
111Kg 4:29 God gave Solomon wisdom, very great insight, and understanding as [vast] as the sand on the seashore.
111Kg 4:30 Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
111Kg 4:31 He was wiser than anyone-- wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, sons of Mahol. His reputation extended to all the surrounding nations.
111Kg 4:32 Solomon composed 3,000 proverbs, and his songs numbered 1,005.
111Kg 4:33 He described trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He also taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
111Kg 4:34 People came from everywhere, [sent] by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, to listen to Solomon's wisdom.
111Kg 5:1 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that he had been anointed king in his father's place, for Hiram had always been friends with David.
111Kg 5:2 Solomon sent [this message] to Hiram:
111Kg 5:3 "You know my father David was not able to build a temple for the name of the LORD his God. This was because of the warfare all around him until the LORD put his enemies under his feet.
111Kg 5:4 The LORD my God has now given me rest all around; there is no enemy or crisis.
111Kg 5:5 So I plan to build a temple for the name of the LORD my God, according to what the LORD promised my father David: 'I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the temple for My name.'
111Kg 5:6 "Therefore, command that cedars from Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants' wages according to whatever you say, for you know that not a man among us knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians."
111Kg 5:7 When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he greatly rejoiced and said, "May the LORD be praised today! He has given David a wise son to be over this great people!"
111Kg 5:8 Then Hiram sent [a reply] to Solomon, saying, "I have heard your message; I will do everything you want regarding the cedar and cypress timber.
111Kg 5:9 My servants will bring [the logs] down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will break them apart there, and you can take them away. You then can meet my needs by providing my household with food."
111Kg 5:10 So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted,
111Kg 5:11 and Solomon provided Hiram with 100,000 bushels of wheat as food for his household and 110,000 gallons of beaten oil. Solomon did this for Hiram year after year.
111Kg 5:12 The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
111Kg 5:13 Then King Solomon drafted forced laborers from all Israel; the labor force numbered 30,000 men.
111Kg 5:14 He sent 10,000 to Lebanon each month in shifts; one month they were in Lebanon, two months they were at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
111Kg 5:15 Solomon had 70,000 porters and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains,
111Kg 5:16 not including his 3,300 deputies in charge of the work. They ruled over the people doing the work.
111Kg 5:17 The king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones.
111Kg 5:18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried [the stone] and prepared the timber and stone for the temple's construction.
111Kg 6:1 Solomon [began to] build the temple for the LORD in the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of his reign over Israel, in the second month, in the month of Ziv.
111Kg 6:2 The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
111Kg 6:3 The portico in front of the temple sanctuary was 30 feet long extending across the temple's width, and 15 feet deep in front of the temple.
111Kg 6:4 He also made windows with beveled frames for the temple.
111Kg 6:5 He then built a chambered structure along the temple wall, encircling the walls of the temple, that is, the sanctuary and the inner sanctuary. And he made side chambers all around.
111Kg 6:6 The lowest chamber was seven and a half feet wide, the middle was nine feet wide, and the third was 10 and a half feet wide. He also provided offset ledges for the temple all around the outside so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.
111Kg 6:7 The temple's construction used finished stones cut at the quarry so that no hammer, chisel, or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.
111Kg 6:8 The door for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the temple. They went up a stairway to the middle [chamber], and from the middle to the third.
111Kg 6:9 When he finished building the temple, he paneled it with boards and planks of cedar.
111Kg 6:10 He built the chambers along the entire temple, joined to the temple with cedar beams; [each story was] seven and a half feet high.
111Kg 6:11 The word of the LORD came to Solomon:
111Kg 6:12 "As for this temple you are building-- if you walk in My statutes, execute My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill My promise to you, which I made to your father David.
111Kg 6:13 I will live among the Israelites and not abandon My people Israel."
111Kg 6:14 When Solomon finished building the temple,
111Kg 6:15 he paneled the interior temple walls with cedar boards; from the temple floor to the surface of the ceiling he overlaid the interior with wood. He also overlaid the floor with cypress boards.
111Kg 6:16 Then he lined 30 feet of the rear of the temple with cedar boards from the floor to the surface of the ceiling, and he built the interior as an inner sanctuary, the most holy place.
111Kg 6:17 The temple, that is, the sanctuary in front of the most holy place, was 60 feet long.
111Kg 6:18 The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with [ornamental] gourds and flower blossoms. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen.
111Kg 6:19 He prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple to put the ark of the LORD's covenant there.
111Kg 6:20 The interior of the sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high; he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the cedar altar.
111Kg 6:21 Next, Solomon overlaid the interior of the temple with pure gold, and he hung gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary and overlaid it with gold.
111Kg 6:22 So he added the gold overlay to the entire temple until everything was completely finished, including the entire altar that belongs in the inner sanctuary.
111Kg 6:23 In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim 15 feet high out of olive wood.
111Kg 6:24 One wing of the [first] cherub was seven and a half feet long, and the other wing was seven and a half feet long. The wingspan was 15 feet from tip to tip.
111Kg 6:25 The second cherub also was 15 feet; both cherubim had the same size and shape.
111Kg 6:26 The first cherub's height was 15 feet and so was the second cherub's.
111Kg 6:27 Then he put the cherubim inside the inner temple. Since their wings were spread out, the first one's wing touched [one] wall while the second cherub's wing touched the other wall, and in the middle of the temple their wings were touching wing to wing.
111Kg 6:28 He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
111Kg 6:29 He carved all the surrounding temple walls with carved engravings-- cherubim, palm trees and flower blossoms-- in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.
111Kg 6:30 He overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.
111Kg 6:31 For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he made olive wood doors. The pillars of the doorposts were five-sided.
111Kg 6:32 The two doors were made of olive wood. He carved cherubim, palm trees and flower blossoms on them and overlaid them with gold, hammering gold over the cherubim and palm trees.
111Kg 6:33 In the same way, he made four-sided olive wood doorposts for the sanctuary entrance.
111Kg 6:34 The two doors were made of cypress wood; the first door had two folding sides, and the second door had two folding panels.
111Kg 6:35 He carved cherubim, palm trees and flower blossoms on them and overlaid them with gold applied evenly over the carving.
111Kg 6:36 He built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams.
111Kg 6:37 The foundation of the LORD's temple was laid in [Solomon's] fourth year in the month of Ziv.
111Kg 6:38 In [his] eleventh year in the eighth month, in the month of Bul, the temple was completed in every detail and according to every specification. So he built it in seven years.
111Kg 7:1 Solomon completed his entire palace-complex after 13 years of construction.
111Kg 7:2 He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on top of the pillars.
111Kg 7:3 It was paneled above with cedar at the top of the chambers that [rested] on 45 pillars, fifteen per row.
111Kg 7:4 There were three rows of window frames, facing each other in three tiers.
111Kg 7:5 All the doors and doorposts had rectangular frames, the openings facing each other in three tiers.
111Kg 7:6 He made the hall of pillars 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. A portico was in front of the pillars, and a canopy with pillars were in front of them.
111Kg 7:7 He made the Hall of the Throne where he would judge-- the Hall of Judgment. It was paneled with cedar from the floor to the rafters.
111Kg 7:8 Solomon's own palace where he would live, in the other courtyard behind the hall, was of similar construction. And he made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, his wife.
111Kg 7:9 All of these [buildings] were of costly stones, cut to size and sawed with saws on the inner and outer surfaces, from foundation to coping and from the outside to the great courtyard.
111Kg 7:10 The foundation was made of large, costly stones 12 and 15 feet long.
111Kg 7:11 Above were also costly stones, cut to size, as well as cedar wood.
111Kg 7:12 Around the great courtyard, as well as the inner courtyard of the LORD's temple and the portico of the temple, were three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams.
111Kg 7:13 King Solomon had Hiram brought from Tyre.
111Kg 7:14 He was a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a bronze craftsman. Hiram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge to do every kind of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work.
111Kg 7:15 He cast two [hollow] bronze pillars: each 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference.
111Kg 7:16 He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars; seven and a half feet was the height of the first capital, and seven and a half feet was also the height of the second capital.
111Kg 7:17 The capitals on top of the pillars had gratings of latticework, wreaths made of chainwork-- seven for the first capital and seven for the second.
111Kg 7:18 He made the pillars with two encircling rows of pomegranates on the one grating to cover the capital on top; he did the same for the second capital.
111Kg 7:19 And the capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, six feet [high].
111Kg 7:20 The capitals on the two pillars were also immediately above the rounded surface next to the grating, and 200 pomegranates were in rows encircling each capital.
111Kg 7:21 He set up the pillars at the portico of the sanctuary: he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin; then he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz.
111Kg 7:22 The tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. Then the work of the pillars was completed.
111Kg 7:23 He made the cast [metal] reservoir, 15 feet from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was seven and a half feet high and 45 feet in circumference.
111Kg 7:24 [Ornamental] gourds encircled it below the brim, 10 every half yard, completely encircling the reservoir. The gourds were cast in two rows when the reservoir was cast.
111Kg 7:25 It stood on 12 oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The reservoir was on top of them and all their hindquarters were toward the center.
111Kg 7:26 The reservoir was three inches thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup or of a lily blossom. It held 11,000 gallons.
111Kg 7:27 Then he made 10 bronze water carts. Each water cart was six feet long, six feet wide, and four and a half feet high.
111Kg 7:28 This was the design of the carts: They had frames; the frames were between the cross-pieces,
111Kg 7:29 and on the frames between the cross-pieces were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the cross-pieces there was a pedestal above, and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
111Kg 7:30 Each cart had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. Underneath the four corners of the basin were cast supports, each next to a wreath.
111Kg 7:31 And the water cart's opening inside the crown on top was 18 inches wide. The opening was round, made as a pedestal 27 inches wide. On it were carvings, but their frames were square, not round.
111Kg 7:32 There were four wheels under the frames, and the wheel axles were part of the water cart; each wheel was 27 inches tall.
111Kg 7:33 The wheels' design was similar to that of chariot wheels: their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal.
111Kg 7:34 Four supports were at the four corners of each water cart; each support was one piece with the water cart.
111Kg 7:35 At the top of the cart was a band nine inches high encircling it; also, at the top of the cart, its braces and its frames were one piece with it.
111Kg 7:36 He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the plates of its braces and on its frames, wherever each had space, with encircling wreaths.
111Kg 7:37 In this way he made the 10 water carts using the same casting, dimensions, and shape for all of them.
111Kg 7:38 Then he made 10 bronze basins-- each basin holding 220 gallons and each was six feet wide-- one basin for each of the 10 water carts.
111Kg 7:39 He set five water carts on the right side of the temple and five on the left side. He put the reservoir near the right side of the temple toward the southeast.
111Kg 7:40 Then Hiram made the basins, the shovels, and the sprinkling basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he was doing for King Solomon on the LORD's temple:
111Kg 7:41 two pillars; bowls for the capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two gratings for covering both bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars;
111Kg 7:42 the 400 pomegranates for the two gratings (two rows of pomegranates for each grating covering both capitals' bowls on top of the pillars);
111Kg 7:43 the 10 water carts; the 10 basins on the water carts;
111Kg 7:44 the reservoir; the 12 oxen underneath the reservoir;
111Kg 7:45 and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling basins. All the utensils that Hiram made for King Solomon at the LORD's temple [were made] of burnished bronze.
111Kg 7:46 The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.
111Kg 7:47 Solomon left all the utensils unweighed because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
111Kg 7:48 Solomon also made all the equipment in the LORD's temple: the gold altar; the gold table that the bread of the Presence was placed on;
111Kg 7:49 the pure gold lampstands in front of the inner sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left; the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs;
111Kg 7:50 the pure gold ceremonial bowls, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles, and firepans; and the gold hinges for the doors of the inner temple (that is, the most holy place) and for the doors of the temple sanctuary.
111Kg 7:51 So all the work King Solomon did in the LORD's temple was completed. Then Solomon brought in the consecrated things of his father David-- the silver, the gold, and the utensils-- and put them in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.
111Kg 8:1 At that time Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the tribal heads and the ancestral leaders of the Israelites before him at Jerusalem in order to bring the ark of the LORD's covenant from Zion, the city of David.
111Kg 8:2 So all the men of Israel were assembled in the presence of King Solomon in the seventh month, the month of Ethanim at the festival.
111Kg 8:3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark.
111Kg 8:4 The priests and the Levites brought the ark of the LORD, the tent of meeting, and the holy utensils that were in the tent.
111Kg 8:5 King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel, who had gathered around him and were with him in front of the ark, were sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered, because there were so many.
111Kg 8:6 The priests brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the most holy place beneath the wings of the cherubim.
111Kg 8:7 For the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim covered the ark and its poles from above.
111Kg 8:8 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen from outside [the sanctuary]; they are there to this day.
111Kg 8:9 Nothing was in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Horeb,where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of the land of Egypt.
111Kg 8:10 When the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the LORD's temple,
111Kg 8:11 and because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
111Kg 8:12 Then Solomon said: The LORD said that He would dwell in thick darkness,
111Kg 8:13 but I have indeed built an exalted temple for You, a place for Your dwelling forever.
111Kg 8:14 The king turned around and blessed the entire congregation of Israel while they were standing.
111Kg 8:15 He said: May the LORD God of Israel be praised! He spoke directly to my father David, and He has fulfilled [the promise] by His power. He said,
111Kg 8:16 "Since the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city to build a temple in among any of the tribes of Israel, so that My name would be there. But I have chosen David to rule My people Israel."
111Kg 8:17 It was in the desire of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
111Kg 8:18 But the LORD said to my father David, "Since it was your desire to build a temple for My name, you have done well to have this desire.
111Kg 8:19 Yet you are not the one to build it; instead, your son, your own offspring, will build it for My name."
111Kg 8:20 The LORD has fulfilled what He promised. I have taken the place of my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
111Kg 8:21 I have provided a place there for the ark, where the LORD's covenant is that He made with our ancestors when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
111Kg 8:22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire congregation of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
111Kg 8:23 He said: LORD God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping the gracious covenant with Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.
111Kg 8:24 You have kept what You promised to Your servant, my father David. You spoke directly [to him] and You fulfilled [Your promise] by Your power as it is today.
111Kg 8:25 Therefore, LORD God of Israel, keep what You promised to Your servant, my father David: You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons guard their walk before Me as you have walked before Me.
111Kg 8:26 Now LORD God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant, my father David.
111Kg 8:27 But will God indeed live on earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built.
111Kg 8:28 Listen to Your servant's prayer and his petition, LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant prays before You today,
111Kg 8:29 so that Your eyes may watch over this temple night and day, toward the place where You said: My name will be there, and so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.
111Kg 8:30 Hear the petition of Your servant and Your people Israel, which they pray toward this place. May You hear in Your dwelling place in heaven. May You hear and forgive.
111Kg 8:31 When a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
111Kg 8:32 may You hear in heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing what he has done on his own head and providing justice for the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
111Kg 8:33 When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and praise Your name, and they pray and plead with You for mercy in this temple,
111Kg 8:34 may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave their ancestors.
111Kg 8:35 When the skies are shut and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and praise Your name, and they turn from their sins because You are afflicting them,
111Kg 8:36 may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way they should walk in. May You send rain on Your land that You gave Your people for an inheritance.
111Kg 8:37 When there is famine on the earth, when there is pestilence, when there is blight, mildew, locust, or grasshopper, when their enemy besieges them in the region of their fortified cities, [when there is] any plague or illness,
111Kg 8:38 whatever prayer or petition anyone from Your people Israel might have-- each man knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple--
111Kg 8:39 may You hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, and may You forgive, act, and repay the man, according to all his ways, since You know his heart, for You alone know every human heart,
111Kg 8:40 so that they may fear You all the days they live on the land You gave our ancestors.
111Kg 8:41 Even for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name--
111Kg 8:42 for they will hear of Your great name, mighty hand, and outstretched arm, and will come and pray toward this temple--
111Kg 8:43 may You hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all the foreigner asks You for. Then all the people on earth will know Your name, to fear You as Your people Israel do and know that this temple I have built is called by Your name.
111Kg 8:44 When Your people go out to fight against their enemies, wherever You send them, and they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the temple I have built for Your name,
111Kg 8:45 may You hear their prayer and petition in heaven and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:46 When they sin against You-- for there is no one who does not sin-- and You are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, and their captors deport them to the enemy's country-- whether distant or nearby--
111Kg 8:47 and when they come to their senses in the land where they were deported and repent and petition You in their captors' land: "We have sinned and done wrong; we have been wicked,"
111Kg 8:48 and when they return to You with their whole mind and heart in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and when they pray to You in the direction of their land that You gave their ancestors, the city You have chosen, and the temple I have built for Your name,
111Kg 8:49 may You hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:50 May You forgive Your people who sinned against You and all their rebellions against You, and may You give them compassion in the eyes of their captors, so that they may be compassionate to them.
111Kg 8:51 For they are Your people and Your inheritance; You brought them out of Egypt, out of the middle of an iron furnace.
111Kg 8:52 May Your eyes be open to Your servant's petition and to the petition of Your people Israel, listening to them whenever they call to You.
111Kg 8:53 For You, Lord God, have set them apart as Your inheritance from all the people on earth, as You spoke through Your servant Moses when You brought their ancestors out of Egypt.
111Kg 8:54 When Solomon finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up from kneeling before the altar of the LORD, with his hands spread out toward heaven,
111Kg 8:55 and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel with a loud voice:
111Kg 8:56 "May the LORD be praised! He has given rest to His people Israel according to all He has said. Not one of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses has failed.
111Kg 8:57 May the LORD our God be with us as He was with our ancestors. May He not abandon us or leave us.
111Kg 8:58 May He incline our hearts toward Him to walk in all His ways and to keep His commands, ordinances, and judgments, which He commanded our ancestors.
111Kg 8:59 May my words I have made my petition with before the LORD be near the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold His servant's cause and the cause of His people Israel, as each day requires,
111Kg 8:60 and so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God. There is no other!
111Kg 8:61 Let your heart be completely devoted to the LORD our God to walk in His ordinances and to keep His commands, as it is today."
111Kg 8:62 The king and all Israel with him were offering sacrifices in the LORD's presence.
111Kg 8:63 Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD: 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. In this manner the king and all the Israelites dedicated the LORD's temple.
111Kg 8:64 On the same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORD's temple because that was where he offered the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the fellowship offerings since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to accommodate the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.
111Kg 8:65 Solomon and all Israel with him-- a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt-- observed the festival at that time in the presence of the LORD our God, seven days, and seven [more] days-- 14 days.
111Kg 8:66 On the fifteenth day he sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went home to their tents rejoicing and with joyful hearts for all the goodness that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel.
111Kg 9:1 When Solomon finished building the temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all that Solomon desired to do,
111Kg 9:2 the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time just as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
111Kg 9:3 The LORD said to him: I have heard your prayer and petition you have made before Me. I have consecrated this temple you have built, to put My name there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there at all times.
111Kg 9:4 As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing everything I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
111Kg 9:5 I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
111Kg 9:6 If you or your sons turn away from following Me and do not keep My commands-- My statutes that I have set before you-- and if you go and serve other gods and worship them,
111Kg 9:7 I will cut off Israel from the land I gave them, and I will reject the temple I have sanctified for My name. Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.
111Kg 9:8 Though this temple is [now] exalted, every passerby will be appalled and will hiss. They will say: Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?
111Kg 9:9 Then they will say: Because they abandoned the LORD their God who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt. They clung to other gods and worshiped and served them. Because of this, the LORD brought all this ruin on them.
111Kg 9:10 At the end of 20 years during which Solomon had built the two houses, the LORD's temple and the royal palace--
111Kg 9:11 Hiram king of Tyre having supplied him with cedar and cypress logs and gold for his every wish-- King Solomon gave Hiram 20 towns in the land of Galilee.
111Kg 9:12 So Hiram went out from Tyre to look over the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them.
111Kg 9:13 So he said, "What are these towns you've given me, my brother?" So he called them the Land of Cabul, as they are [still called] today.
111Kg 9:14 Now Hiram had sent the king 9,000 pounds of gold.
111Kg 9:15 This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon had imposed to build the LORD's temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
111Kg 9:16 Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He then burned it down, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
111Kg 9:17 Then Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon,
111Kg 9:18 Baalath, Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah,
111Kg 9:19 all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon, the chariot cities, the cavalry cities, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or anywhere else in the land of his dominion.
111Kg 9:20 As for all the peoples who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites--
111Kg 9:21 their descendants who remained in the land after them, those whom the Israelites were unable to annihilate-- Solomon imposed forced labor on them; [it is this way] until today.
111Kg 9:22 But Solomon did not consign the Israelites to slavery; they were soldiers, his servants, his commanders, his captains, and commanders of his chariots and his cavalry.
111Kg 9:23 These were the deputies who were over Solomon's work: 550 who ruled over the people doing the work.
111Kg 9:24 Pharaoh's daughter moved from the city of David to the house that Solomon had built for her; he then built the terraces.
111Kg 9:25 Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, and he burned incense with them in the LORD's presence. So he completed the temple.
111Kg 9:26 King Solomon put together a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.
111Kg 9:27 With the fleet, Hiram sent his servants, experienced seamen, along with Solomon's servants.
111Kg 9:28 They went to Ophir and acquired gold there-- 16 tons-- and delivered it to Solomon.
111Kg 10:1 The queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame connected with the name of the LORD and came to test him with difficult questions.
111Kg 10:2 She came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones. She came to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that was on her mind.
111Kg 10:3 So Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain to her.
111Kg 10:4 When the queen of Sheba observed all of Solomon's wisdom, the palace he had built,
111Kg 10:5 the food at his table, his servants' residence, his attendants' service and their attire, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he offered at the LORD's temple, it took her breath away.
111Kg 10:6 She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true.
111Kg 10:7 But I didn't believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, I was not even told half. Your wisdom and prosperity far exceed the report I heard.
111Kg 10:8 How happy are your men. How happy are these servants of yours, who always stand in your presence hearing your wisdom.
111Kg 10:9 May the LORD your God be praised! He delighted in you and put you on the throne of Israel, because of the LORD's eternal love for Israel. He has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness."
111Kg 10:10 Then she gave the king four and a half tons of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again did such a quantity of spices arrive as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
111Kg 10:11 In addition, Hiram's fleet that carried gold from Ophir brought from Ophir a large quantity of almug wood and precious stones.
111Kg 10:12 The king made the almug wood into steps for the LORD's temple and the king's palace and into harps and lyres for the singers. Never [before] had such almug wood come, and [the like] has not been seen [again] even to this very day.
111Kg 10:13 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire-- whatever she asked-- besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she, along with her servants, returned to her own country.
111Kg 10:14 The weight of gold that came to Solomon annually was 25 tons,
111Kg 10:15 besides what came from merchants, traders' merchandise, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
111Kg 10:16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 15 pounds of gold went into each shield.
111Kg 10:17 He made 300 small shields of hammered gold; about four pounds of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
111Kg 10:18 The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with fine gold.
111Kg 10:19 The throne had six steps; there was a rounded top at the back of the throne, armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.
111Kg 10:20 Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom.
111Kg 10:21 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, since it was considered as nothing in Solomon's time,
111Kg 10:22 for the king had ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram's fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
111Kg 10:23 King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the world in riches and in wisdom.
111Kg 10:24 The whole world wanted an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
111Kg 10:25 Every man would bring his annual tribute: items of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, and horses and mules.
111Kg 10:26 Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen and stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
111Kg 10:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills.
111Kg 10:28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue. The king's traders bought them from Kue at the going price.
111Kg 10:29 A chariot was imported from Egypt for 15 pounds [of silver], and a horse for about four pounds. In the same way, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram through their agents.
111Kg 11:1 King Solomon loved many foreign women in addition to Pharaoh's daughter: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women
111Kg 11:2 from the nations that the LORD had told the Israelites about, "Do not intermarry with them, and they must not intermarry with you, because they will turn you away [from Me] to their gods." Solomon was deeply attached to these women and loved [them].
111Kg 11:3 He had 700 wives who were princesses and 300 concubines, and they turned his heart away [from the LORD].
111Kg 11:4 When Solomon was old, his wives seduced him [to follow] other gods. His heart was not completely with the LORD his God, as his father David's heart had been.
111Kg 11:5 Solomon followed Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
111Kg 11:6 Solomon did what was evil in the LORD's sight, and unlike his father David, he did not completely follow the LORD.
111Kg 11:7 At that time, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable idol of Moab, and for Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites on the hill across from Jerusalem.
111Kg 11:8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who were burning incense and offering sacrifices to their gods.
111Kg 11:9 The LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
111Kg 11:10 He had commanded him about this, so that he would not follow other gods, but Solomon did not do what the LORD had commanded.
111Kg 11:11 Then the LORD said to Solomon, "Since you have done this and did not keep My covenant and My statutes, which I commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.
111Kg 11:12 However, I will not do it during your lifetime because of your father David; I will tear it out of your son's hand.
111Kg 11:13 Yet, I will not tear the entire kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem that I chose."
111Kg 11:14 So the LORD raised up Hadad the Edomite as an enemy against Solomon. He was of the royal family in Edom.
111Kg 11:15 Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab, the commander of the army, had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom.
111Kg 11:16 For Joab and all Israel had remained there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom.
111Kg 11:17 Hadad fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites from his father's servants. At the time Hadad was a small boy.
111Kg 11:18 Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, ordered that he [be given] food, and gave him land.
111Kg 11:19 Pharaoh liked Hadad so much that he gave him a wife, the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes.
111Kg 11:20 Tahpenes' sister gave birth to Hadad's son Genubath. Tahpenes [herself] weaned him in Pharaoh's palace, and Genubath [lived] there along with Pharaoh's sons.
111Kg 11:21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me leave, so I can go to my own country."
111Kg 11:22 But Pharaoh asked him, "What do you lack here with me for you to want to go back to your own country?" "Nothing," he replied, "but please let me leave."
111Kg 11:23 God raised up Rezon son of Eliada as an enemy against Solomon. Rezon had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah
111Kg 11:24 and gathered men to himself. He became captain of a raiding party when David killed the Zobaites. He went to Damascus, lived there, and became king in Damascus.
111Kg 11:25 Rezon was Israel's enemy throughout Solomon's reign, adding to the trouble Hadad [had caused]. He ruled over Aram, but he loathed Israel.
111Kg 11:26 Now Solomon's servant, Jeroboam son of Nebat, was an Ephraimite from Zeredah. His widowed mother's name was Zeruah. Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon,
111Kg 11:27 and this is the reason he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces [and] repaired the opening in the wall of the city of his father David.
111Kg 11:28 Now the man Jeroboam was capable, and Solomon noticed the young man because he was getting things done. So he appointed him over the entire labor force of the house of Joseph.
111Kg 11:29 During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as Jeroboam came out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself with a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field.
111Kg 11:30 Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he had on, tore it into 12 pieces,
111Kg 11:31 and said to Jeroboam, "Take 10 pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I am about to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand. I will give you 10 tribes,
111Kg 11:32 but one tribe will remain his because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem, the city I chose out of all the tribes of Israel.
111Kg 11:33 For they have abandoned Me; they have bowed the knee to Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, to Chemosh, the god of Moab, and to Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways to do right in My eyes and to carry out My statutes and My judgments as his father David did.
111Kg 11:34 " 'However, I will not take the whole kingdom from his hand but will let him be ruler all the days of his life because of My servant David, whom I chose and who kept My commandments and My statutes.
111Kg 11:35 I will take 10 tribes of the kingdom from his son's hand and give them to you.
111Kg 11:36 I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city I chose for Myself to put My name there.
111Kg 11:37 I will appoint you, and you will reign as king over all you want, and you will be king over Israel.
111Kg 11:38 " 'After that, if you obey all I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and My commandments as My servant David did, I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David, and I will give you Israel.
111Kg 11:39 I will humble David's descendants, because of [their unfaithfulness], but not forever.'"
111Kg 11:40 Therefore, Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he remained until Solomon's death.
111Kg 11:41 The rest of the events of Solomon's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and his wisdom, are written about in the Book of Solomon's Events.
111Kg 11:42 The length of Solomon's reign in Jerusalem over all Israel totaled 40 years.
111Kg 11:43 Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam became king in his place.
111Kg 12:1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.
111Kg 12:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard [about it], for he was still in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon's presence, Jeroboam stayed in Egypt.
111Kg 12:3 They summoned him, and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam:
111Kg 12:4 "Your father made our yoke harsh. You, therefore, lighten your father's harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
111Kg 12:5 Rehoboam replied, "Go home for three days and then return to me." So the people left.
111Kg 12:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, "How do you advise me to respond to these people?"
111Kg 12:7 They replied, "Today if you will be a servant to these people and serve them, and if you respond to them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever."
111Kg 12:8 But he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and served him.
111Kg 12:9 He asked them, "What message do you advise that we send back to these people who said to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
111Kg 12:10 Then the young men who had grown up with him told him, "This is what you should say to these people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!' This is what you should tell them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins!
111Kg 12:11 Although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips.'"
111Kg 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had ordered: "Return to me on the third day."
111Kg 12:13 Then the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice the elders had given him
111Kg 12:14 and spoke to them according to the young men's advice: "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips."
111Kg 12:15 The king did not listen to the people, because the turn of events came from the LORD to carry out His word, which the LORD had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
111Kg 12:16 When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered him: What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Israel, return to your tents; David, now look after your own house! So Israel went to their tents,
111Kg 12:17 but Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.
111Kg 12:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to get into the chariot and flee to Jerusalem.
111Kg 12:19 Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today.
111Kg 12:20 When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. No one followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone.
111Kg 12:21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized 180,000 choice warriors from the entire house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
111Kg 12:22 But a revelation from God came to Shemaiah, the man of God:
111Kg 12:23 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
111Kg 12:24 'This is what the LORD says: You are not to march up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for I have done this.' " So they listened to what the LORD said and went back as He had told them.
111Kg 12:25 Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built Penuel.
111Kg 12:26 Jeroboam said to himself, "[The way things are going] now, the kingdom might return to the house of David.
111Kg 12:27 If these people regularly go to offer sacrifices in the LORD's temple in Jerusalem, the heart of these people will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will murder me and go back to the king of Judah."
111Kg 12:28 So the king sought advice. Then he made two gold calves, and he said to the people, "Going to Jerusalem is too difficult for you. Israel, here is your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt."
111Kg 12:29 He set up one in Bethel, and put the other in Dan.
111Kg 12:30 This led to sin; the people walked [in procession] before one of the calves all the way to Dan.
111Kg 12:31 Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places and set up priests from every class of people who were not Levites.
111Kg 12:32 Jeroboam made a festival in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival in Judah. He offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up. He also stationed in Bethel the priests for the high places he had set up.
111Kg 12:33 He offered sacrifices on the altar he had set up in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month he had decided on his own. He made a festival for the Israelites, offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense.
111Kg 13:1 A man of God came from Judah to Bethel by a revelation from the LORD while Jeroboam was standing beside the altar to burn incense.
111Kg 13:2 The man of God cried out against the altar by a revelation from the LORD: "Altar, altar, this is what the LORD says, 'A son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah, and he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who are burning incense on you. Human bones will be burned on you.'"
111Kg 13:3 He gave a sign that day. He said, "This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: 'The altar will now be ripped apart, and the ashes that are on it will be spilled out.'"
111Kg 13:4 When the king heard the word that the man of God had cried out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Arrest him!" But the hand he stretched out against him withered, and he could not pull it back to himself.
111Kg 13:5 The altar was ripped apart, and the ashes spilled off the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
111Kg 13:6 Then the king responded to the man of God, "Please plead for the favor of the LORD your God and pray for me so that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God pleaded for the favor of the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him and became as it had been at first.
111Kg 13:7 Then the king declared to the man of God, "Come home with me, refresh yourself, and I'll give you a reward."
111Kg 13:8 But the man of God replied, "If you were to give me half your house, I still wouldn't go with you, and I wouldn't eat bread or drink water in this place,
111Kg 13:9 for this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or go back the way you came.'"
111Kg 13:10 So he went another way; he did not go back by the way he had come to Bethel.
111Kg 13:11 Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel. His son came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. His sons also told their father the words that he had spoken to the king.
111Kg 13:12 Then their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" His sons had seen the way taken by the man of God who had come from Judah.
111Kg 13:13 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him, and he got on it.
111Kg 13:14 He followed the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. He asked him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he said.
111Kg 13:15 Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread."
111Kg 13:16 But he answered, "I cannot go back with you, eat bread, or drink water with you in this place,
111Kg 13:17 for a message came to me by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or go back by the way you came.'"
111Kg 13:18 He said to him, "I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD: 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.' " The old prophet deceived him,
111Kg 13:19 and the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.
111Kg 13:20 While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back,
111Kg 13:21 and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because you rebelled against the command of the LORD and did not keep the commandment that the LORD your God commanded you,
111Kg 13:22 but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the place that He said to you: Do not eat bread and do not drink water, your corpse will never reach the grave of your fathers.'"
111Kg 13:23 So after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet he had brought back.
111Kg 13:24 When he left, a lion met him along the way and killed him. His corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey was standing beside it; the lion was standing beside the corpse too.
111Kg 13:25 There were men passing by who saw the corpse thrown on the road and the lion standing beside it, and they went and spoke [about it] in the city where the old prophet lived.
111Kg 13:26 When the prophet who had brought him back from his way heard [about it], he said, "He is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD. The LORD has given him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD that He spoke to him."
111Kg 13:27 Then the old prophet instructed his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." They saddled it,
111Kg 13:28 and he went and found the corpse of the man of God thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse or mauled the donkey.
111Kg 13:29 So the prophet lifted the corpse of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back. The old prophet came into to the city to mourn and to bury him.
111Kg 13:30 Then he laid the corpse in his own grave, and they mourned over him: "Oh, my brother!"
111Kg 13:31 After he had buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, you must bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones,
111Kg 13:32 for the word that he cried out by a revelation from the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Samaria is certain to happen."
111Kg 13:33 After all this Jeroboam did not repent of his evil way but again set up priests from every class of people for the high places. Whoever so desired it, he ordained, and they became priests of the high places.
111Kg 13:34 For the house of Jeroboam, this was the sin that caused it to be wiped out and annihilated from the face of the earth.
111Kg 14:1 At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became sick.
111Kg 14:2 Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go disguise yourself, so they won't know that you're Jeroboam's wife, and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who told about me becoming king over this people.
111Kg 14:3 Take with you 10 loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."
111Kg 14:4 Jeroboam's wife did that: she went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah's house. Ahijah could not see; his gaze was fixed due to his age.
111Kg 14:5 But the LORD had said to Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming soon to ask you about her son, for he is sick. You are to say such and such to her. When she arrives, she will be disguised."
111Kg 14:6 When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? I have bad news for you.
111Kg 14:7 Go tell Jeroboam, 'This is what the LORD God of Israel says: I raised you up from among the people, appointed you ruler over My people Israel,
111Kg 14:8 tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you. But you were not like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all of his heart, doing only what is right in My eyes.
111Kg 14:9 You behaved more wickedly than all who were before you. In order to provoke Me, you have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and cast images, but you have flung Me behind your back.
111Kg 14:10 Because of all this, I am about to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam: I will eliminate all of Jeroboam's males, both slave and free, in Israel; I will sweep away the house of Jeroboam as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone!
111Kg 14:11 Anyone who belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat, for the LORD has said it!'
111Kg 14:12 "As for you, get up and go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the boy will die.
111Kg 14:13 All Israel will mourn for him and bury him, for this one alone out of Jeroboam's [sons] will come to the grave, because in him [alone] out of the house of Jeroboam something was found pleasing to the LORD God of Israel.
111Kg 14:14 The LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel, who will eliminate the house of Jeroboam. This is the day, yes, even today!
111Kg 14:15 For the LORD will strike Israel [and the people will shake] as a reed shakes in water. He will uproot Israel from this good soil that He gave to their forefathers. He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates because they made their Asherah poles, provoking the LORD.
111Kg 14:16 He will give up Israel, because of Jeroboam's sins that he committed and caused Israel to commit."
111Kg 14:17 Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As she was crossing the threshold of the house, the boy died.
111Kg 14:18 He was buried, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.
111Kg 14:19 As for the rest of the events of Jeroboam's [reign], how he waged war and how he reigned, note that they are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 14:20 The length of Jeroboam's reign was 22 years. He rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab became king in his place.
111Kg 14:21 Now Rehoboam, Solomon's son, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king; he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name. Rehoboam's mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
111Kg 14:22 Judah did what was evil in the LORD's eyes. They provoked Him to jealous anger more than all that their ancestors had done with the sins they committed.
111Kg 14:23 They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree;
111Kg 14:24 there were even male shrine prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the nations the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
111Kg 14:25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem.
111Kg 14:26 He seized the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the treasuries of the royal palace. He took everything. He took all the gold shields that Solomon had made.
111Kg 14:27 King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them into the care of the captains of the royal escortswho guarded the entrance to the king's palace.
111Kg 14:28 Whenever the king entered the LORD's temple, the royal escorts would carry the shields, then they would take them back to the royal escorts' armory.
111Kg 14:29 The rest of the events of Rehoboam's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
111Kg 14:30 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns.
111Kg 14:31 Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite. His son Abijam became king in his place.
111Kg 15:1 In the eighteenth year of [Israel's] King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah;
111Kg 15:2 he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
111Kg 15:3 Abijam walked in all the sins his father had done before him, and he was not completely devoted to the LORD his God as his ancestor David had been.
111Kg 15:4 But because of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem
111Kg 15:5 because David did what was right in the LORD's eyes, and he did not turn aside from anything He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
111Kg 15:6 There had been war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of Rehoboam's life.
111Kg 15:7 The rest of the events of Abijam's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings. There was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
111Kg 15:8 Abijam rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Asa became king in his place.
111Kg 15:9 In the twentieth year of Israel's King Jeroboam, Asa became king of Judah;
111Kg 15:10 he reigned 41 years in Jerusalem. His grandmother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
111Kg 15:11 Asa did what was right in the LORD's eyes, as his ancestor David had done.
111Kg 15:12 He banished the male shrine prostitutes from the land and removed all of the idols that his fathers had made.
111Kg 15:13 He also removed his grandmother Maacah from being queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. Asa chopped down her obscene image and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
111Kg 15:14 The high places were not taken away; but Asa's heart was completely with the LORD his entire life.
111Kg 15:15 He brought his father's consecrated gifts and his own consecrated gifts into the LORD's temple: silver, gold, and utensils.
111Kg 15:16 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
111Kg 15:17 Israel's King Baasha went to war against Judah. He built Ramah in order to deny anyone access to Judah's King Asa.
111Kg 15:18 So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the treasuries of the royal palace and put it into the hands of his servants. Then King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon son of Hezion king of Aram who lived in Damascus, saying,
111Kg 15:19 "There is a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me."
111Kg 15:20 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, all Chinneroth, and the whole land of Naphtali.
111Kg 15:21 When Baasha heard [about it], he quit building Ramah and stayed in Tirzah.
111Kg 15:22 Then King Asa gave a command to everyone without exception in Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had built it with. Then King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah with them.
111Kg 15:23 The rest of all the events of Asa's [reign], along with all his might, all his accomplishments, and the cities he built, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings. But in his old age he developed a disease in his feet.
111Kg 15:24 Then Asa rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his forefather David. His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place.
111Kg 15:25 Nadab son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Judah's King Asa; he reigned over Israel two years.
111Kg 15:26 Nadab did what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the example of his father and the sin he had caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 15:27 Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon of the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.
111Kg 15:28 In the third year of Judah's King Asa, Baasha killed Nadab and reigned in his place.
111Kg 15:29 When Baasha became king, he struck down the entire house of Jeroboam. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone alive until he had destroyed his family according to the word of the LORD He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
111Kg 15:30 This was because of Jeroboam's sins he had committed and had caused Israel to commit in the provocation he had provoked the LORD God of Israel with.
111Kg 15:31 The rest of the events of Nadab's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 15:32 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
111Kg 15:33 In the third year of Judah's King Asa, Baasha son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah; [he reigned] 24 years.
111Kg 15:34 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the example of Jeroboam and the sin he had caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha:
111Kg 16:2 "Because I raised you up from the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, but you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin, provoking Me with their sins,
111Kg 16:3 take note: I will sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat:
111Kg 16:4 Anyone who belongs to Baasha and dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and anyone who is his and dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.
111Kg 16:5 The rest of the events of Baasha's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and might, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 16:6 Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah became king in his place.
111Kg 16:7 Through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani the word of the LORD also came against Baasha and against his house because of all the evil he had done in the LORD's sight, provoking Him with the work of his hands and being like the house of Jeroboam, and because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam.
111Kg 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of Judah's King Asa, Elah son of Baasha became king over Israel in Tirzah; [he reigned] two years.
111Kg 16:9 His servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him while Elah was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was in charge of the household at Tirzah.
111Kg 16:10 In the twenty-seventh year of Judah's King Asa, Zimri went in, struck Elah down, and killed him. Then Zimri became king in his place.
111Kg 16:11 When he became king, as soon as he was seated on his throne, Zimri struck down the entire house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male, whether of his kinsmen or his friends.
111Kg 16:12 So Zimri exterminated the entire house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD He had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,
111Kg 16:13 because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Elah, which they committed and caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD God of Israel with their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:14 The rest of the events of Elah's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of Judah's King Asa, Zimri became king for seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines.
111Kg 16:16 When the encamped troops heard that Zimri had not only conspired but had also struck down the king, then all Israel made Omri, the army commander, king over Israel that very day in the camp.
111Kg 16:17 Omri along with all Israel marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
111Kg 16:18 When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned down the royal palace over himself. He died
111Kg 16:19 because of his sin he committed by doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and by following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:20 The rest of the events of Zimri's [reign], along with the conspiracy that he instigated, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 16:21 At that time the people of Israel were split in half: half the people followed Tibni son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
111Kg 16:22 However, the people who followed Omri proved stronger than those who followed Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
111Kg 16:23 In the thirty-first year of Judah's King Asa, Omri became king over Israel; [he reigned] 12 years. He reigned six years in Tirzah,
111Kg 16:24 then he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for 150 pounds of silver, and he built up the hill. He named the city he built Samaria based on the name Shemer, the owner of the hill.
111Kg 16:25 Omri did what was evil in the LORD's sight; he did more evil than all who were before him.
111Kg 16:26 He followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat and the sins he caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD God of Israel with their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:27 The rest of the events of Omri's [reign], along with his accomplishments and the might he exercised, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 16:28 Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. His son Ahab became king in his place.
111Kg 16:29 Ahab son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Judah's King Asa; Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria 22 years.
111Kg 16:30 But Ahab son of Omri did what was evil in the LORD's sight more than all who were before him.
111Kg 16:31 Then, as if following the sin of Jeroboam son of Nebat were a trivial matter, he married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and then proceeded to serve Baal and worship him.
111Kg 16:32 He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he had built in Samaria.
111Kg 16:33 Ahab also made an Asherah pole. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
111Kg 16:34 During his reign, Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn, he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his youngest, he set up its gates, according to the word of the LORD He had spoken through Joshua son of Nun.
111Kg 17:1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, from the Gilead settlers, said to Ahab, "As the LORD God of Israel lives, I stand before Him, and there will be no dew or rain during these years except by my command!"
111Kg 17:2 Then a revelation from the LORD came to him:
111Kg 17:3 "Leave here, turn eastward, and hide yourself at the Wadi Cherith where it enters the Jordan.
111Kg 17:4 You are to drink from the wadi. I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there."
111Kg 17:5 So he did what the LORD commanded. Elijah left and lived by the Wadi Cherith where it enters the Jordan.
111Kg 17:6 The ravens kept bringing him bread and meat in the morning and in the evening, and he drank from the wadi.
111Kg 17:7 After a while, the wadi dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
111Kg 17:8 Then the word of the LORD came to him:
111Kg 17:9 "Get up, go to Zarephath that belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman who is a widow to provide for you there."
111Kg 17:10 So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow woman gathering wood. Elijah called to her and said, "Please bring me a little water in a cup and let me drink."
111Kg 17:11 As she went to get it, he called to her and said, "Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand."
111Kg 17:12 But she said, "As the LORD your God lives, I don't have anything baked-- only a handful of flour in the jar and a bit of oil in the jug. Just now, I am gathering a couple of sticks in order to go prepare it for myself and my son so we can eat it and die."
111Kg 17:13 Then Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said. Only make me a small loaf from it and bring it out to me. Afterwards, you may make some for yourself and your son,
111Kg 17:14 for this is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'The flour jar will not become empty and the oil jug will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the surface of the land.'"
111Kg 17:15 So she proceeded to do according to the word of Elijah. She and he and her household ate for many days.
111Kg 17:16 The flour jar did not become empty, and the oil jug did not run dry, according to the word of the LORD He had spoken through Elijah.
111Kg 17:17 After this, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. His illness became very severe until no breath remained in him.
111Kg 17:18 She said to Elijah, "Man of God, what do we have in common? Have you come to remind me of my guilt and to kill my son?"
111Kg 17:19 But Elijah said to her, "Give me your son." So he took him from her arms, brought him up to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
111Kg 17:20 Then he cried out to the LORD and said, "My LORD God, have You also brought tragedy on the widow I am staying with by killing her son?"
111Kg 17:21 Then he stretched himself out over the boy three times. He cried out to the LORD and said, "My LORD God, please let this boy's life return to him!"
111Kg 17:22 So the LORD listened to Elijah's voice, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.
111Kg 17:23 Then Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, "Look, your son is alive."
111Kg 17:24 Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know you are a man of God and the LORD's word in your mouth is the truth."
111Kg 18:1 After a long time, the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year: "Go and present yourself to Ahab. I will send rain on the surface of the land."
111Kg 18:2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.
111Kg 18:3 Ahab called for Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. Obadiah was a man who greatly feared the LORD
111Kg 18:4 and took 100 prophets and hid them, 50 men to a cave, and provided them with food and water when Jezebel slaughtered the LORD's prophets.
111Kg 18:5 Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go throughout the land to every spring of water and to every wadi. Perhaps we'll find grass so we can keep the horses and mules alive and not have to destroy any cattle."
111Kg 18:6 They divided the land between them in order to cover it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
111Kg 18:7 While Obadiah was [walking] along the road, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized him, he fell with his face [to the ground] and said, "Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
111Kg 18:8 "It is I," he replied. "Go tell your lord, 'Elijah is here!'"
111Kg 18:9 But Obadiah said, "What sin have I committed, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death?
111Kg 18:10 As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you. When they said, 'He is not here,' he made that kingdom or nation swear they had not found you.
111Kg 18:11 "Now you say, 'Go tell your lord, "Elijah is here!"'
111Kg 18:12 But when I leave you, the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off to some place I don't know. Then when I go report to Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. But [I], your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.
111Kg 18:13 Wasn't it reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the LORD's prophets? I hid 100 of the prophets of the LORD, 50 men to a cave, and I provided them with food and water.
111Kg 18:14 Now you say, 'Go tell your lord, "Elijah is here!" ' He will kill me!"
111Kg 18:15 Then Elijah said, "As the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, today I will present myself to Ahab."
111Kg 18:16 Obadiah went to meet Ahab and report to him. Then Ahab went to meet Elijah.
111Kg 18:17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is that you, you destroyer of Israel?"
111Kg 18:18 He replied, "I have not destroyed Israel, but you and your father's house have, because you have abandoned the LORD's commandments and followed the Baals.
111Kg 18:19 Now summon all Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table."
111Kg 18:20 So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel.
111Kg 18:21 Then Elijah approached all the people and said, "How long will you hesitate between two opinions? If Yahweh is God, follow Him. But if Baal, follow him." But the people didn't answer him a word.
111Kg 18:22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I am the only remaining prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
111Kg 18:23 Let two bulls be given to us. They are to choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and place it on the wood but not light the fire. I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not light the fire.
111Kg 18:24 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh. The God who answers with fire, He is God." All the people answered, "That [sounds] good."
111Kg 18:25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god but don't light the fire."
111Kg 18:26 So they took the bull that he gave them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "Baal, answer us!" But there was no sound; no one answered. Then they did their lame dance around the altar they had made.
111Kg 18:27 At noon Elijah mocked them. He said, "Shout loudly, for he's a god! Maybe he's thinking it over; maybe he has wandered away; or maybe he's on the road. Perhaps he's sleeping and will wake up!"
111Kg 18:28 They shouted loudly, and cut themselves with knives and spears, according to their custom, until blood gushed out on them.
111Kg 18:29 All afternoon, they kept on raving until the offering of the evening sacrifice, but there was no sound, no one answered, no one paid attention.
111Kg 18:30 Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near me." So all the people approached him. Then he repaired the LORD's altar that had been torn down:
111Kg 18:31 Elijah took 12 stones-- according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Israel will be your name"--
111Kg 18:32 and he built an altar with the stones in the name of Yahweh. Then he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold about four gallons.
111Kg 18:33 Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood. He said, "Fill four water pots with water and pour it on the offering to be burned and on the wood."
111Kg 18:34 Then he said, "A second time!" and they did it a second time. And then he said, "A third time!" and they did it a third time.
111Kg 18:35 So the water ran all around the altar; he even filled the trench with water.
111Kg 18:36 At the time for offering the [evening] sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached [the altar] and said, "LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that at Your word I have done all these things.
111Kg 18:37 Answer me, LORD! Answer me so that this people will know that You, Yahweh, are God and that You have turned their hearts back."
111Kg 18:38 Then Yahweh's fire fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.
111Kg 18:39 When all the people saw it, they fell facedown and said, "Yahweh, He is God! Yahweh, He is God!"
111Kg 18:40 Then Elijah ordered them, "Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let even one of them escape." So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon and slaughtered them there.
111Kg 18:41 Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a rainstorm."
111Kg 18:42 So Ahab went to eat and drink, but Elijah went up to the summit of Carmel. He bowed down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
111Kg 18:43 Then he said to his servant, "Go up and look toward the sea." So he went up, looked, and said, "There's nothing." Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."
111Kg 18:44 On the seventh time, he reported, "There's a cloud as small as a man's hand coming from the sea." Then Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Get [your chariot] ready and go down so the rain doesn't stop you.'"
111Kg 18:45 In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and there was a downpour. So Ahab got in [his chariot] and went to Jezreel.
111Kg 18:46 The power of the LORD was on Elijah, and he tucked his mantle under his belt and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
111Kg 19:1 Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
111Kg 19:2 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "May the gods punish me and do so severely if I don't make your life like the life of one of them by this time tomorrow!"
111Kg 19:3 Then Elijah became afraid and immediately ran for his life. When he came to Beer-sheba that belonged to Judah, he left his servant there,
111Kg 19:4 but he went on a day's journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. He said, "[I have had] enough! LORD, take my life, for I'm no better than my fathers."
111Kg 19:5 Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree. Suddenly, an angel touched him. The angel told him, "Get up and eat."
111Kg 19:6 Then he looked, and there at his head was a loaf of bread baked over hot stones and a jug of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again.
111Kg 19:7 Then the angel of the LORD returned a second time and touched him. He said, "Get up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you."
111Kg 19:8 So he got up, ate, and drank. Then on the strength from that food, he walked 40 days and 40 nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.
111Kg 19:9 He entered a cave there and spent the night. Then the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:10 He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God of Hosts, but the Israelites have abandoned Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are looking for me to take my life."
111Kg 19:11 Then He said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the LORD's presence." At that moment, the LORD passed by. A great and mighty wind was tearing at the mountains and was shattering cliffs before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
111Kg 19:12 After the earthquake there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire there was a voice, a soft whisper.
111Kg 19:13 When Elijah heard [it], he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Suddenly, a voice came to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:14 "I have been very zealous for the LORD God of Hosts," he replied, "but the Israelites have abandoned Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they're looking for me to take my life."
111Kg 19:15 Then the LORD said to him, "Go and return by the way you came to the Wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
111Kg 19:16 You are to anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.
111Kg 19:17 Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Jehu.
111Kg 19:18 But I will leave 7,000 in Israel-- every knee that has not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him."
111Kg 19:19 Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat as he was plowing. Twelve teams of oxen were in front of him, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah walked by him and threw his mantle over him.
111Kg 19:20 Elisha left the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, "Please let me kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you." "Go on back," he replied, "for what have I done to you?"
111Kg 19:21 So he turned back from following him, took the team of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen's wooden yoke and plow, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he left, followed Elijah, and served him.
111Kg 20:1 Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army. Thirty-two kings, along with horses and chariotry, were with him. He marched up, besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
111Kg 20:2 He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, "This is what Ben-hadad says:
111Kg 20:3 'Your silver and your gold are mine! And Your best wives and children are mine as well!'"
111Kg 20:4 Then the king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord king: I am yours, along with all that I have."
111Kg 20:5 The messengers then returned and said, "This is what Ben-hadad says: 'I have sent [messengers] to you, saying: Your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children you are to give to me.
111Kg 20:6 But at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your palace and your servants' houses. Whatever is precious to you, they will lay their hands on and take away.'"
111Kg 20:7 Then the king of Israel called for all the elders of the land and said, "Think it over and you will see that this one is only looking for trouble, for he demanded my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I didn't turn him down."
111Kg 20:8 All the elders and all the people said to him, "Don't listen or agree."
111Kg 20:9 So he said to Ben-hadad's messengers, "Say to my lord the king, 'Everything you demanded of your servant the first time, I will do, but this thing I cannot do.' " So the messengers left and took word back to him.
111Kg 20:10 Then Ben-hadad sent [messengers] to him and said, "May the gods punish me and do so severely if Samaria's dust amounts to a handful for each of the people who follow me."
111Kg 20:11 The king of Israel answered, "Say this: 'Let not him who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.'"
111Kg 20:12 When Ben-hadad heard this response, while he and the kings were drinking in the tents, he said to his servants, "Take [your] positions." So they took [their] positions against the city.
111Kg 20:13 A prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and said, "This is what the LORD says: 'Do you see this entire immense horde? Watch, I am handing it over to you today so that you may know that I am the LORD.'"
111Kg 20:14 Ahab asked, "By whom?" And the prophet said, "This is what the LORD says: 'By the young men of the provincial leaders.' " Then he asked, "Who is to start the battle?" He said, "You."
111Kg 20:15 So Ahab counted the young men of the provincial leaders, and there were 232. After them he counted all the Israelite troops: 7,000.
111Kg 20:16 They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings who were helping him were getting drunk in the tents.
111Kg 20:17 The young men of the provincial leaders marched out first. Then Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, saying, "Men are marching out of Samaria."
111Kg 20:18 So he said, "If they have marched out in peace, take them alive, and if they have marched out for battle, take them alive."
111Kg 20:19 The young men of the provincial leaders and the army behind them marched out from the city,
111Kg 20:20 and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with the cavalry.
111Kg 20:21 Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the cavalry and the chariotry. He inflicted a great slaughter on Aram.
111Kg 20:22 The prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, "Go and strengthen yourself, then consider what you should do, for in the spring the king of Aram will march up against you."
111Kg 20:23 Now the king of Aram's servants said to him, "Their gods are gods of the hill country. That's why they were stronger than we. Instead, we should fight with them on the plain; then we will certainly be stronger than they.
111Kg 20:24 Also do this: remove each king from his position and appoint captains in their place.
111Kg 20:25 Raise another army for yourself like the army you lost-- horse for horse, chariot for chariot-- and let's fight with them on the plain; and we will certainly be stronger than they." The king listened to them and did so.
111Kg 20:26 In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek to battle Israel.
111Kg 20:27 The Israelites mobilized, gathered supplies, and went to fight them. The Israelites camped in front of them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the landscape.
111Kg 20:28 Then the man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Arameans have said: The LORD is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys, I will hand over this entire immense horde to you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'"
111Kg 20:29 They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle took place, and the Israelites struck down the Arameans-- 100,000 foot soldiers in one day.
111Kg 20:30 The ones who remained fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell on those 27,000 remaining men. Ben-hadad also fled and went into an inner room in the city.
111Kg 20:31 His servants said to him, "Consider this: we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings [who show] special kindness. So let's put sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and let's go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life."
111Kg 20:32 So they dressed with sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, went to the king of Israel, and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please spare my life.' " So he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
111Kg 20:33 Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, so they quickly latched onto the hint and said, "Yes, your brother Ben-hadad." Then he said, "Go and bring him." So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him come up into the chariot.
111Kg 20:34 Then Ben-hadad said to him, "The cities that my father took from your father I restore to you, and you may set up marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, like my father set up in Samaria." [Ahab responded],"On the basis of this treaty, I release you." So he made a treaty with him and released him.
111Kg 20:35 One of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow prophet by the word of the LORD, "Strike me!" But the man refused to strike him.
111Kg 20:36 He told him, "Because you did not listen to the voice of the LORD, mark my words: When you leave me, a lion will kill you." When he left him, a lion found him and killed him.
111Kg 20:37 The prophet found another man and said to him, "Strike me!" So the man struck him, inflicting a wound.
111Kg 20:38 Then the prophet went and waited for the king on the road. He disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.
111Kg 20:39 As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and said, "Your servant marched out into the midst of the battle. Suddenly, a man turned aside and brought someone to me and said, 'Guard this man! If he is ever missing, it will be your life in place of his life, or you will weigh out 75 pounds of silver.'
111Kg 20:40 But while your servant was busy here and there, he disappeared." The king of Israel said to him, "That will be your sentence; you yourself have decided it."
111Kg 20:41 He quickly removed the bandage from his eyes. The king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.
111Kg 20:42 The prophet said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because you released from your hand the man I had devoted to destruction, it will be your life in place of his life and your people in place of his people.'"
111Kg 20:43 The king of Israel left for home resentful and angry, and he entered Samaria.
111Kg 21:1 Some time passed after these events. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard; it was in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
111Kg 21:2 So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard so I can have it for a vegetable garden, since it is right next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place, or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver."
111Kg 21:3 But Naboth said to Ahab, "I will never give my fathers' inheritance to you."
111Kg 21:4 So Ahab went to his palace resentful and angry, because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had told him. He had said, "I will not give you my fathers' inheritance." He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and didn't eat any food.
111Kg 21:5 Then his wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, "Why are you so upset that you refuse to eat?"
111Kg 21:6 "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite," he replied. "I told him: Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, 'I won't give you my vineyard!'"
111Kg 21:7 Then his wife Jezebel said to him, "Now, exercise your royal power over Israel. Get up, eat some food, and be happy. [For] I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
111Kg 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.
111Kg 21:9 In the letters, she wrote: Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people.
111Kg 21:10 Then seat two wicked men opposite him and have them testify against him, saying, "You have cursed God and king!" Then take him out and stone him to death.
111Kg 21:11 The men of his city, the elders and nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had commanded them, as was written in the letters she had sent them.
111Kg 21:12 They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people.
111Kg 21:13 The two wicked men came in and sat opposite him. Then the wicked men testified against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth has cursed God and king!" So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.
111Kg 21:14 Then they sent [word] to Jezebel, "Naboth has been stoned to death."
111Kg 21:15 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite who refused to give it to you for silver, since Naboth isn't alive, but dead."
111Kg 21:16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.
111Kg 21:17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:
111Kg 21:18 "Get up and go to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. You'll find him in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.
111Kg 21:19 Tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you murdered and also taken possession?' Then tell him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where the dogs licked Naboth's blood, the dogs will also lick your blood!'"
111Kg 21:20 Ahab said to Elijah, "So, you have caught me, my enemy." He replied, "I have caught you because you devoted yourself to do what is evil in the LORD's sight.
111Kg 21:21 This is what the LORD says: 'I am about to bring disaster on you and will sweep away your descendants: I will eliminate all of Ahab's males, both slave and free, in Israel;
111Kg 21:22 I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked [My] anger and caused Israel to sin.
111Kg 21:23 The LORD also speaks of Jezebel: The dogs will eat Jezebel in the plot of land at Jezreel:
111Kg 21:24 He who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and he who dies in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.'"
111Kg 21:25 Still, there was no one like Ahab, who devoted himself to do what was evil in the LORD's sight, because his wife Jezebel incited him.
111Kg 21:26 He committed the most detestable acts by going after idols as the Amorites had, whom the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
111Kg 21:27 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth over his body, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth and walked around subdued.
111Kg 21:28 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite:
111Kg 21:29 "Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? I will not bring the disaster during his lifetime, because he has humbled himself before Me. I will bring the disaster on his house during his son's lifetime."
111Kg 22:1 There was a lull of three years without war between Aram and Israel.
111Kg 22:2 However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to visit the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:3 The king of Israel had said to his servants, "Don't you know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?"
111Kg 22:4 So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
111Kg 22:5 But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "First, please ask what the LORD's will is."
111Kg 22:6 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, about 400 men, and asked them, "Should I go against Ramoth-gilead for war or should I refrain?" They replied, "March up, and the Lord will hand it over to the king."
111Kg 22:7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of Yahweh here any more? Let's ask him."
111Kg 22:8 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king shouldn't say that!" Jehoshaphat replied.
111Kg 22:9 So the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Hurry [and get] Micaiah son of Imlah!"
111Kg 22:10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in royal attire, were each sitting on his own throne. They were on the threshing floor at the entrance to Samaria's gate, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them.
111Kg 22:11 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns and said, "This is what the LORD says: 'You will gore the Arameans with these until they are finished off.'"
111Kg 22:12 And all the prophets were prophesying the same: "March up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will hand it over to the king."
111Kg 22:13 The messenger who went to call Micaiah instructed him, "Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."
111Kg 22:14 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, I will say whatever the LORD says to me."
111Kg 22:15 So he went to the king, and the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war, or should we refrain?" Micaiah told him, "March up and succeed. The LORD will hand it over to the king."
111Kg 22:16 But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
111Kg 22:17 So Micaiah said: I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'They have no master; let everyone return home in peace.'
111Kg 22:18 So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster?"
111Kg 22:19 Then Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and the whole heavenly host was standing by Him at His right hand and at His left hand.
111Kg 22:20 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' So one was saying this and another was saying that.
111Kg 22:21 "Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, 'I will entice him.'
111Kg 22:22 "The LORD asked him, 'How?' "He said, 'I will go and become a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' "Then He said, 'You will certainly entice him and prevail. Go and do that.'
111Kg 22:23 "You see, the LORD has put a lying spirit into the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you."
111Kg 22:24 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up, hit Micaiah in the face, and demanded, "Did the Spirit of the LORD leave me to speak to you?"
111Kg 22:25 Micaiah replied, "You will soon see when you go to hide yourself in an inner chamber on that day."
111Kg 22:26 Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,
111Kg 22:27 and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this guy in prison and feed him only bread and water until I come back safely.'"
111Kg 22:28 But Micaiah said, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he said, "Listen, all you people!"
111Kg 22:29 Then the king of Israel and Judah's King Jehoshaphat went up to Ramoth-gilead.
111Kg 22:30 But the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal attire." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
111Kg 22:31 Now the king of Aram had ordered his 32 chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone at all except the king of Israel."
111Kg 22:32 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, "He must be the king of Israel!" So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
111Kg 22:33 When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
111Kg 22:34 But a man drew his bow without taking special aim and struck the king of Israel through the joints of his armor. So he said to his charioteer, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!"
111Kg 22:35 The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. He died that evening, and blood from his wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
111Kg 22:36 Then the cry rang out in the army as the sun set, declaring: Each man to his own city, and each man to his own land!
111Kg 22:37 So the king died and was brought to Samaria. They buried the king in Samaria.
111Kg 22:38 Then someone washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes bathed [in it], according to the word of the LORD that He had spoken.
111Kg 22:39 The rest of the events of Ahab's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, the ivory palace he built, and all the cities he built, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
111Kg 22:40 Ahab rested with his fathers, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
111Kg 22:41 Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Israel's King Ahab.
111Kg 22:42 Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king; he reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
111Kg 22:43 He walked in all the ways of his father Asa; he did not turn away from them but did what was right in the LORD's sight. However, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
111Kg 22:44 Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:45 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's [reign], along with the might he exercised and how he waged war, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
111Kg 22:46 He removed from the land the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who were left from the days of his father Asa.
111Kg 22:47 There was no king in Edom; a deputy served as king.
111Kg 22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
111Kg 22:49 At that time, Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships," but Jehoshaphat was not willing.
111Kg 22:50 Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his forefather David. His son Jehoram became king in his place.
111Kg 22:51 Ahaziah son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Judah's King Jehoshaphat; he reigned over Israel two years.
111Kg 22:52 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He walked in the way of his father, in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin.
111Kg 22:53 He served Baal and worshiped him. He provoked the LORD God of Israel just as his father had done.
12
122Kg 1:1 After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
122Kg 1:2 Ahaziah had fallen through the latticed window of his upper room in Samaria and was injured. So he sent messengers instructing them: "Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will recover from this injury."
122Kg 1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?'
122Kg 1:4 Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'You will not get up from your sickbed-- you will certainly die.' " Then Elijah left.
122Kg 1:5 The messengers returned to the king, who asked them, "Why have you come back?"
122Kg 1:6 They replied, "A man came to meet us and said, 'Go back to the king who sent you and declare to him: This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you're sending [these men] to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, you will not get up from your sickbed-- you will certainly die.'"
122Kg 1:7 The king asked them: "What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke those words to you?"
122Kg 1:8 They replied, "A hairy man with a leather belt around his waist." He said, "It's Elijah the Tishbite."
122Kg 1:9 So King Ahaziah sent a captain of 50 with his 50 [men] to Elijah. When the captain went up to him, he was sitting on top of the hill. He announced, "Man of God, the king declares, 'Come down!'"
122Kg 1:10 Elijah responded to the captain of the 50, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50 [men]." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his 50 [men].
122Kg 1:11 So the king sent another captain of 50 with his 50 [men] to Elijah. He took in the situation and announced, "Man of God, this is what the king says: 'Come down immediately!'"
122Kg 1:12 Elijah responded, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50 [men]." So a divine fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his 50 [men].
122Kg 1:13 Then the king sent a third captain of 50 with his 50 [men]. The third captain of 50 went up and fell on his knees in front of Elijah and begged him, "Man of God, please let my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours be precious in your sight.
122Kg 1:14 Already fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of 50 with their fifties, but this time let my life be precious in your sight."
122Kg 1:15 The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him. Don't be afraid of him." So he got up and went down with him to the king.
122Kg 1:16 Then Elijah said to King Ahaziah, "This is what the LORD says: 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron-- is it because there is no God in Israel for you to inquire of His will? You will not get up from your sickbed; you will certainly die.'"
122Kg 1:17 Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Since he had no son, Joram became king in his place. [This happened] in the second year of Judah's King Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat.
122Kg 1:18 The rest of the events of Ahaziah's [reign], along with his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 2:1 The time had come for the LORD to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal,
122Kg 2:2 and Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD is sending me on to Bethel." But Elisha replied, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
122Kg 2:3 Then the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?" He said, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."
122Kg 2:4 Elijah said to him, "Elisha, stay here; the LORD is sending me to Jericho." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.
122Kg 2:5 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho came up to Elisha and said, "Do you know that today the LORD will take your master away from you?" He said, "Yes, I know. Be quiet."
122Kg 2:6 Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD is sending me to the Jordan." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.
122Kg 2:7 Fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood facing them from a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan.
122Kg 2:8 Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and left. Then the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
122Kg 2:9 After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell [me] what I can do for you before I am taken from you." So Elisha answered, "Please, let there be a double portion of your spirit on me."
122Kg 2:10 Elijah replied, "You have asked for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you, you will have it. If not, you won't."
122Kg 2:11 As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire with horses of fire suddenly appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went up into heaven in the whirlwind.
122Kg 2:12 As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, "My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!" Then he never saw Elijah again. He took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.
122Kg 2:13 Elisha picked up the mantle that had fallen off Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
122Kg 2:14 Then he took the mantle Elijah had dropped and struck the waters. "Where is the LORD God of Elijah?" he asked. He struck the waters himself, and they parted to the right and the left, and Elisha crossed over.
122Kg 2:15 When the sons of the prophets from Jericho, who were facing him, saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." They came to meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.
122Kg 2:16 Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Since there are 50 strong men here with your servants, please let them go and search for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the LORD has carried him away and put him on one of the mountains or into one of the valleys." He answered, "Don't send [them]."
122Kg 2:17 However, they urged him to the point of embarrassment, so he said, "Send [them]." They sent 50 men, who looked for three days but did not find him.
122Kg 2:18 When they returned to him in Jericho where he was staying, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"
122Kg 2:19 Then the men of the city said to Elisha, "Even though our lord can see that the city's location is good, the water is bad and the land unfruitful."
122Kg 2:20 He replied, "Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it." After they had brought him one,
122Kg 2:21 Elisha went out to the spring of water, threw salt in it, and said, "This is what the LORD says: 'I have healed this water. No longer will death or unfruitfulness result from it.'"
122Kg 2:22 Therefore, the water remains healthy to this very day according to the word that Elisha spoke.
122Kg 2:23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking up the path, some small boys came out of the city and harassed him, chanting, "Go up, baldy! Go up, baldy!"
122Kg 2:24 He turned around, looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of the youths.
122Kg 2:25 From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel, and then he returned to Samaria.
122Kg 3:1 Joram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Judah's King Jehoshaphat; he reigned 12 years.
122Kg 3:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, but not like his father and mother, for he removed the sacred pillar of Baal his father had made.
122Kg 3:3 Nevertheless, Joram clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. He did not turn away from them.
122Kg 3:4 King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams,
122Kg 3:5 but when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
122Kg 3:6 So King Joram marched out from Samaria at that time and mobilized all Israel.
122Kg 3:7 Then he sent [a message] to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" Jehoshaphat said, "I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
122Kg 3:8 Then he asked, "Which route should we take?" Joram replied, "The route of the wilderness of Edom."
122Kg 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out. After they had traveled their indirect route for seven days, they had no water for the army or their animals.
122Kg 3:10 Then the king of Israel said, "Oh no, the LORD has summoned us three kings, only to hand us over to Moab."
122Kg 3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there a prophet of the LORD here? Let's inquire of the LORD through him." One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat, who used to pour water on Elijah's hands, is here."
122Kg 3:12 Jehoshaphat affirmed, "The LORD's words are with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went to him.
122Kg 3:13 However, Elisha said to King [Joram] of Israel, "We have nothing in common. Go to the prophets of your father and your mother!" But the king of Israel replied, "No, because it is the LORD who has summoned us three kings to hand us over to Moab."
122Kg 3:14 Elisha responded, "As the LORD of Hosts lives, I stand before Him. If I did not have respect for King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would not look at you; I wouldn't take notice of you.
122Kg 3:15 Now, bring me a musician." While the musician played, the LORD's hand came on Elisha.
122Kg 3:16 Then he said, "This is what the LORD says: 'Dig ditch after ditch in this wadi.'
122Kg 3:17 For the LORD says, 'You will not see wind or rain, but the wadi will be filled with water, and you will drink-- you and your cattle and your animals.'
122Kg 3:18 This is easy in the LORD's sight. He will also hand Moab over to you.
122Kg 3:19 Then you must attack every fortified city and every choice city. You must cut down every good tree and stop up every spring of water. You must ruin every good piece of land with stones."
122Kg 3:20 About the time for the grain offering the [next] morning, water suddenly came from the direction of Edom and filled the land.
122Kg 3:21 All Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, from the youngest to the oldest, were summoned and took their stand at the border.
122Kg 3:22 When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and the Moabites saw that the water across from them was red like blood.
122Kg 3:23 "This is blood!" they exclaimed. "The kings have clashed swords and killed each other. So, to the spoil, Moab!"
122Kg 3:24 However, when the Moabites came to Israel's camp, the Israelites attacked them, and they fled from them. So Israel went into the land and struck down the Moabites.
122Kg 3:25 They destroyed the cities, and each of them threw stones to cover every good piece of land. They stopped up every spring of water and cut down every good tree. In the end, only the buildings of Kir-hareseth were left. Then men with slings surrounded [the city] and attacked it.
122Kg 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took 700 swordsmen with him to try to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not do it.
122Kg 3:27 So he took his firstborn son, who was to become king in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. Great wrath was on the Israelites, and they withdrew from him and returned to their land.
122Kg 4:1 One of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant, my husband, has died. You know that your servant feared the LORD. Now the creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves."
122Kg 4:2 Elisha asked her, "What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" She said, "Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil."
122Kg 4:3 Then he said, "Go and borrow empty containers from everyone-- from all your neighbors. Do not get just a few.
122Kg 4:4 Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full ones to one side."
122Kg 4:5 So she left. After she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing her [containers], and she kept pouring.
122Kg 4:6 When they were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another container." But he replied, "There aren't any more." Then the oil stopped.
122Kg 4:7 She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go sell the oil and pay your debt; you and your sons can live on the rest."
122Kg 4:8 One day Elisha went to Shunem. A prominent woman who [lived] there persuaded him to eat some food. So whenever he passed by, he stopped there to eat.
122Kg 4:9 Then she said to her husband, "I know that the one who often passes by here is a holy man of God,
122Kg 4:10 so let's make a small room upstairs and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. Whenever he comes, he can stay there."
122Kg 4:11 One day he came there and stopped and went to the room upstairs to lie down.
122Kg 4:12 He ordered his attendant Gehazi, "Call this Shunammite woman." So he called her and she stood before him.
122Kg 4:13 Then he said to Gehazi, "Say to her, 'Look, you've gone to all this trouble for us. What can [we] do for you? Can [we] speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?' " She answered, "I am living among my own people."
122Kg 4:14 So he asked, "Then what should be done for her?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
122Kg 4:15 "Call her," Elisha said. So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway.
122Kg 4:16 Elisha said, "At this time next year you will have a son in your arms." Then she said, "No, my lord. Man of God, do not deceive your servant."
122Kg 4:17 The woman conceived and gave birth to a son at the same time the following year, as Elisha had promised her.
122Kg 4:18 The child grew and one day went out to his father and the harvesters.
122Kg 4:19 [Suddenly], he complained to his father, "My head! My head!" His father told his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
122Kg 4:20 So he picked him up and took him to his mother. The child sat on her lap until noon and then died.
122Kg 4:21 Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut him in, and left.
122Kg 4:22 She summoned her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can hurry to the man of God and then come back."
122Kg 4:23 But he said, "Why go to him today? It's neither New Moon or Sabbath." She replied, "Everything is all right."
122Kg 4:24 Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Hurry, don't slow the pace for me unless I tell you."
122Kg 4:25 So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his attendant Gehazi, "Look, there's the Shunammite woman.
122Kg 4:26 Run out to meet her and ask, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your son all right?' " And she answered, "Everything's all right."
122Kg 4:27 When she came up to the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone-- she is in severe anguish, and the LORD has hidden it from me. He hasn't told me."
122Kg 4:28 Then she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Didn't I say, 'Do not deceive me?'"
122Kg 4:29 So Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your mantle under your belt, take my staff with you, and go. If you meet anyone, don't [stop to] greet him, and if a man greets you, don't answer him. Then place my staff on the boy's face."
122Kg 4:30 The boy's mother said [to Elisha], "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.
122Kg 4:31 Gehazi went ahead of them and placed the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or sign of life, so he went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy didn't wake up."
122Kg 4:32 When Elisha got to the house, he discovered the boy lying dead on his bed.
122Kg 4:33 So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
122Kg 4:34 Then he went up and lay on the boy: he put mouth to mouth, eye to eye, hand to hand. While he bent down over him, the boy's flesh became warm.
122Kg 4:35 Elisha got up, went into the house, and paced back and forth. Then he went up and bent down over him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
122Kg 4:36 Elisha called Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite woman." He called her and she came. Then Elisha said, "Pick up your son."
122Kg 4:37 She came, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; she picked up her son and left.
122Kg 4:38 When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet. He said to his attendant, "Put on the large pot and make stew for the sons of the prophets."
122Kg 4:39 One went out to the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment would hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, but they were unaware [of what they were].
122Kg 4:40 They served some for the men to eat, but when they ate the stew they cried out, "There's death in the pot, man of God!" And they were unable to eat it.
122Kg 4:41 Then Elisha said, "Get some meal." He threw it into the pot and said, "Serve it for the people to eat." And there was nothing bad in the pot.
122Kg 4:42 A man from Baal-shalishah came to the man of God with his sack full of 20 loaves of barley bread from the first bread of the harvest. Elisha said, "Give it to the people to eat."
122Kg 4:43 But Elisha's attendant asked, "What? Am I to set 20 loaves before 100 men?" "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said, "for this is what the LORD says: 'They will eat, and they will have some left over.'"
122Kg 4:44 So he gave it to them, and as the LORD had promised, they ate and had some left over.
122Kg 5:1 Naaman, commander of the army for the king of Aram, was a great man in his master's sight and highly regarded because through him, the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was a brave warrior, but he had a skin disease.
122Kg 5:2 Aram had gone on raids and brought back from the land of Israel a young girl who served Naaman's wife.
122Kg 5:3 She said to her mistress, "If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his skin disease."
122Kg 5:4 So Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
122Kg 5:5 Therefore, the king of Aram said, "Go and I will send a letter [with you] to the king of Israel." So he went and took with him 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and 10 changes of clothes.
122Kg 5:6 He brought the letter to the king of Israel, and it read: When this letter comes to you, note that I have sent you my servant Naaman for you to cure him of his skin disease.
122Kg 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, "Am I God, killing and giving life that this man expects me to cure a man of his skin disease? Think it over and you will see that he is only picking a fight with me."
122Kg 5:8 When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel tore his clothes, he sent [a message] to the king, "Why have you torn your clothes? Have him come to me, and he will know there is a prophet in Israel."
122Kg 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house.
122Kg 5:10 Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, "Go wash seven times in the Jordan and your flesh will be restored and you will be clean."
122Kg 5:11 But Naaman got angry and left, saying, "I was telling myself: He will surely come out, stand and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and will wave his hand over the spot and cure the skin disease.
122Kg 5:12 Aren't Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and left in a rage.
122Kg 5:13 But his servants approached and said to him, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more [should you do it] when he tells you, 'Wash and be clean'?"
122Kg 5:14 So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was restored [and became] like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean.
122Kg 5:15 Then Naaman and his whole company went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, "I know there's no God in the whole world except in Israel. Therefore, please accept a gift from your servant."
122Kg 5:16 But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives, I stand before Him. I will not accept it." Naaman urged him to accept it, but he refused.
122Kg 5:17 Naaman responded, "If not, please let two mule-loads of dirt be given to your servant, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but Yahweh.
122Kg 5:18 However, in a particular matter may the LORD pardon your servant: When my master, [the king of Aram], goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship and I, as his right-hand man, bow in the temple of Rimmon-- when I bow in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD pardon your servant in this matter."
122Kg 5:19 So he said to him, "Go in peace." After Naaman had traveled a short distance from Elisha,
122Kg 5:20 Gehazi, the attendant of Elisha the man of God, thought: My master has let this Aramean Naaman off lightly by not accepting from him what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.
122Kg 5:21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, "Is everything all right?"
122Kg 5:22 Gehazi said, "It's all right. My master has sent me to say, 'I have just now discovered that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.'"
122Kg 5:23 But Naaman insisted, "Please, accept 150 pounds." He urged Gehazi and then packed 150 pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Naaman gave them to two of his young men who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
122Kg 5:24 When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from them and stored them in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they left.
122Kg 5:25 Gehazi came and stood by his master. "Where did you go, Gehazi?" Elisha asked him. "Your servant didn't go anywhere," he replied.
122Kg 5:26 But Elisha questioned him, "Wasn't my spirit there when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept money and clothes, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves?
122Kg 5:27 Therefore, Naaman's skin disease will cling to you and your descendants forever." So Gehazi went out from his presence diseased-- [white] as snow.
122Kg 6:1 The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Please notice that the place where we live under your supervision is too small for us.
122Kg 6:2 Please let us go to the Jordan where we can each get a log and can build ourselves a place to live there." "Go," he said.
122Kg 6:3 Then one said, "Please come with your servants." "I'll come," he answered.
122Kg 6:4 So he went with them, and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
122Kg 6:5 As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron [ax head] fell into the water, and he cried out: "Oh, my master, it was borrowed!"
122Kg 6:6 Then the man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, the man of God cut a stick, threw it there, and made the iron float.
122Kg 6:7 Then he said, "Pick it up." So he reached out and took it.
122Kg 6:8 When the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he conferred with his servants, "My camp will be at such and such a place."
122Kg 6:9 But the man of God sent [word] to the king of Israel: "Be careful passing by this place, for the Arameans are going down there."
122Kg 6:10 Consequently, the king of Israel sent [word] to the place the man of God had told him about. The man of God repeatedly warned the king, so the king would be on his guard.
122Kg 6:11 The king of Aram was enraged because of this matter, and he called his servants and demanded of them, "Tell me, which one of us is for the king of Israel?"
122Kg 6:12 One of his servants said, "No one, my lord the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom."
122Kg 6:13 So the king said, "Go and see where he is, so I can send [men] to capture him." When he was told, "Elisha is in Dothan,"
122Kg 6:14 he sent horses, chariots, and a massive army there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
122Kg 6:15 When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So he asked Elisha, "Oh, my master, what are we to do?"
122Kg 6:16 Elisha said, "Don't be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them."
122Kg 6:17 Then Elisha prayed, "LORD, please open his eyes and let him see." So the LORD opened the servant's eyes. He looked and saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
122Kg 6:18 When the Arameans came against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Please strike this nation with blindness." So He struck them with blindness, according to Elisha's word.
122Kg 6:19 Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you're looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
122Kg 6:20 When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, "LORD, open these men's eyes and let them see." So the LORD opened their eyes. They looked and discovered [they were] in Samaria.
122Kg 6:21 When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, "My father, should I kill them? I will kill them."
122Kg 6:22 Elisha replied, "Don't kill them. Do you kill those you have captured with your sword or your bow? Set food and water in front of them so they can eat and drink and go to their master."
122Kg 6:23 So he prepared a great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The Aramean raiders did not come into Israel's land again.
122Kg 6:24 Some time later, King Ben-hadad of Aram brought all his military units together and marched up to besiege Samaria.
122Kg 6:25 So there was a great famine in Samaria, and they continued the siege against it until a donkey's head [sold for] 80 silver [ shekels], and a cup of dove's dung [sold for] five silver [shekels].
122Kg 6:26 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, "My lord the king, help!"
122Kg 6:27 He answered, "If the LORD doesn't help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?"
122Kg 6:28 Then the king asked her, "What's the matter?" She said, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son, and we will eat him today. Then we will eat my son tomorrow.'
122Kg 6:29 So we boiled my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, 'Give up your son, and we will eat him,' but she has hidden her son."
122Kg 6:30 When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. Then, as he was passing by on the wall, the people saw that there was sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin.
122Kg 6:31 He announced, "May God punish me and do so severely if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today."
122Kg 6:32 Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger got to him, Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see how this murderer has sent [someone] to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out. Isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
122Kg 6:33 While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I trust the LORD any longer?"
122Kg 7:1 Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the LORD says: 'About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, six quarts of fine meal [will sell] for a shekel and 12 quarts of barley [will sell] for a shekel.'"
122Kg 7:2 Then the captain, the king's right-hand man, responded to the man of God, "Look, [even if] the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?" Elisha announced, "You will in fact see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat any of it."
122Kg 7:3 Four men with skin diseases were at the entrance to the gate. They said to each other, "Why just sit here until we die?
122Kg 7:4 If we say, 'Let's go into the city,' we will die there because the famine is in the city, but if we sit here, we will also die. So now, come on. Let's go to the Arameans' camp. If they let us live, we will live; if they kill us, we will die."
122Kg 7:5 So the diseased men got up at twilight to go to the Arameans' camp. When they came to the camp's edge, they discovered that there was not a [single] man there,
122Kg 7:6 for the Lord had caused the Aramean camp to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army. The Arameans had said to each other, "The king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to attack us."
122Kg 7:7 So they had gotten up and fled at twilight abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys. The camp was intact, and they had fled for their lives.
122Kg 7:8 When these men came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they picked up the silver, gold, and clothing and went off and hid them. They came back and entered another tent, picked [things] up, and hid them.
122Kg 7:9 Then they said to each other, "We're not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until morning light, we will be punished. Let's go tell the king's household."
122Kg 7:10 The diseased men went and called to the city's gatekeepers and told them, "We went to the Aramean camp and no one was there-- no human sounds. There was nothing but tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents were intact."
122Kg 7:11 The gatekeepers called out, and [the news] was reported to the king's household.
122Kg 7:12 So the king got up in the night and said to his servants, "Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving, so they have left the camp to hide in the open country, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we will take them alive and go into the city.'"
122Kg 7:13 But one of his servants responded, "Please, let [messengers] take five of the horses that are left in the city. [The messengers] are like the whole multitude of Israelites who will die, so let's send them and see."
122Kg 7:14 [The messengers] took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, "Go and see."
122Kg 7:15 So they followed them as far as the Jordan. They saw that the whole way was littered with clothes and equipment the Arameans had thrown off in their haste. The messengers returned and told the king.
122Kg 7:16 Then the people went out and plundered the Aramean camp. It was then that six quarts of fine meal [sold] for a shekel and 12 quarts of barley [sold] for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
122Kg 7:17 The king had appointed the captain, his right-hand man, to be in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him in the gateway. He died, just as the man of God had predicted when the king came to him.
122Kg 7:18 When the man of God had said to the king, "About this time tomorrow 12 quarts of barley [will sell] for a shekel and six quarts of fine meal [will sell] for a shekel at the gate of Samaria,"
122Kg 7:19 this captain had answered the man of God, "Look, [even if] the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?" Elisha had said, "You will in fact see it with your own eyes, but you won't eat any of it."
122Kg 7:20 This is what happened to him: the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
122Kg 8:1 Elisha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Get ready, you and your household, and go and live as a foreigner wherever you can. For the LORD has announced a seven-year famine, and it has already come to the land."
122Kg 8:2 So the woman got ready and did what the man of God said. She and her household lived as foreigners in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
122Kg 8:3 When the woman returned from the land of the Philistines at the end of seven years, she went to appeal to the king for her house and field.
122Kg 8:4 The king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Tell me all the great things Elisha has done."
122Kg 8:5 While he was telling the king how Elisha restored the dead [son] to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life came to appeal to the king for her house and field. So Gehazi said, "My lord the king, this is the woman and this is the son Elisha restored to life."
122Kg 8:6 When the king asked the woman, she told him the story. So the king appointed a court official for her, saying, "Restore all that was hers, along with all the income from the field from the day she left the country until now."
122Kg 8:7 Elisha came to Damascus while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and the king was told, "The man of God has come here."
122Kg 8:8 So the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go meet the man of God. Inquire of the LORD through him, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
122Kg 8:9 Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift: 40 camel-loads of all kinds of goods from Damascus. When he came and stood before him, he said, "Your son, Ben-hadad king of Aram, has sent me to ask you, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
122Kg 8:10 Elisha told him, "Go say to him, 'You are sure to recover.' But the LORD has shown me that he is sure to die."
122Kg 8:11 Then Elisha stared steadily at him until Hazael was ashamed. The man of God wept,
122Kg 8:12 and Hazael asked, "Why is my lord weeping?" He replied, "Because I know the evil you will do to the people of Israel. You will set their fortresses on fire. You will kill their young men with the sword. You will dash their little ones to pieces. You will rip open their pregnant women."
122Kg 8:13 Hazael said, "How could your servant, a mere dog, do this monstrous thing?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram."
122Kg 8:14 Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, "What did Elisha say to you?" He responded, "He told me you are sure to recover."
122Kg 8:15 The next day Hazael took a heavy cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king's face. Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned instead of him.
122Kg 8:16 In the fifth year of Israel's King Joram son of Ahab, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah, replacing his father.
122Kg 8:17 He was 32 years old when he became king; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
122Kg 8:18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab's daughter was his wife. He did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
122Kg 8:19 The LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah because of His servant David, since He had promised to give a lamp to David and to his sons forever.
122Kg 8:20 During Jehoram's reign, Edom rebelled against Judah's control and appointed their own king.
122Kg 8:21 So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. Then at night he set out to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders, but his troops fled to their tents.
122Kg 8:22 So Edom is still in rebellion against Judah's control today. Libnah also rebelled at that time.
122Kg 8:23 The rest of the events of Jehoram's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 8:24 Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
122Kg 8:25 In the twelfth year of Israel's King Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
122Kg 8:26 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king; he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, granddaughter of Israel's King Omri.
122Kg 8:27 He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the LORD's sight like the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law to Ahab's family.
122Kg 8:28 Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to fight against Hazael king of Aram in Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.
122Kg 8:29 So King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him in Ramoth-gilead when he fought against Aram's King Hazael. Then Judah's King Ahaziah son of Jehoram went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab since Joram was ill.
122Kg 9:1 The prophet Elisha called one of the sons of the prophets and said, "Tuck your mantle under your belt, take this flask of oil with you, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
122Kg 9:2 When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Go in, get him away from his colleagues, and take him to an inner room.
122Kg 9:3 Then, take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, 'This is what the LORD says: "I anoint you king over Israel." ' Open the door and escape. Don't wait."
122Kg 9:4 So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead.
122Kg 9:5 When he arrived, the army commanders were sitting there, so he said, "I have a message for you, commander." Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" He answered, "For you, commander."
122Kg 9:6 So Jehu got up and went into the house. The young prophet poured the oil on his head and said, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I anoint you king over the LORD's people, Israel.
122Kg 9:7 You are to strike down the house of your master Ahab so that I may avenge the blood shed by the hand of Jezebel-- the blood of My servants the prophets and of all the servants of the LORD.
122Kg 9:8 The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will eliminate all of Ahab's males, both slave and free, in Israel.
122Kg 9:9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
122Kg 9:10 The dogs will eat Jezebel in the plot of land at Jezreel-- no one will bury her.' " Then the young prophet opened the door and escaped.
122Kg 9:11 When Jehu came out to his master's servants, they asked, "Is everything all right? Why did this crazy person come to you?" Then he said to them, "You know the sort and their ranting."
122Kg 9:12 But they replied, "[That's] a lie! Tell us!" So Jehu said, "He talked to me about this and that and said, 'This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.'"
122Kg 9:13 Each man quickly took his garment and put it under Jehu on the bare steps.They blew the ram's horn and proclaimed, "Jehu is king!"
122Kg 9:14 Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. Joram and all Israel had been at Ramoth-gilead on guard against Hazael king of Aram.
122Kg 9:15 But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought against Aram's King Hazael. Jehu said, "If you [commanders] wish [to make me king], then don't let anyone escape from the city to go tell about it in Jezreel."
122Kg 9:16 Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel since Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to visit Joram.
122Kg 9:17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu's troops approaching and shouted, "I see troops!" Joram responded, "Choose a rider and send him to meet them and have him ask, '[Do you come in] peace?'"
122Kg 9:18 So a horseman went to meet Jehu and said, "This is what the king asks: '[Do you come in] peace?' " Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me." The watchman reported, "The messenger reached them but hasn't started back."
122Kg 9:19 So he sent out a second horseman, who went to them and said, "This is what the king asks: '[Do you come in] peace?' " Jehu answered, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me."
122Kg 9:20 Again the watchman reported, "He reached them but hasn't started back. Also, the driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi-- he drives like a madman."
122Kg 9:21 "Harness!" Joram shouted, and they harnessed his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu at the plot of land of Naboth the Jezreelite.
122Kg 9:22 When Joram saw Jehu he asked, "[Do you come in] peace, Jehu?" He answered, "What peace can there be as long as there is so much prostitution and witchcraft from your mother Jezebel?"
122Kg 9:23 Joram turned around and fled, shouting to Ahaziah, "It's treachery, Ahaziah!"
122Kg 9:24 Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow went through his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
122Kg 9:25 Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, "Pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember when you and I were riding side by side behind his father Ahab, and the LORD uttered this oracle against him:
122Kg 9:26 'As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,' this is the LORD's message, 'so will I repay you on this plot of land,' this is the LORD's message. So now, according to the word of the LORD, pick him up and throw him on the plot of land."
122Kg 9:27 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw [what was happening], he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, shouting, "Shoot him too!" So they shot him in his chariot at Gur Pass near Ibleam, but he fled to Megiddo and died there.
122Kg 9:28 Then his servants carried him to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in his fathers' tomb in the city of David.
122Kg 9:29 It was in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab that Ahaziah had become king over Judah.
122Kg 9:30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, so she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked down from the window.
122Kg 9:31 As Jehu entered the gate, she said, "[Do you come in] peace, Zimri, killer of your master?"
122Kg 9:32 He looked up toward the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him,
122Kg 9:33 and he said, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and Jehu rode over her.
122Kg 9:34 Then he went in, ate and drank, and said, "Take care of this cursed woman and bury her, since she's a king's daughter."
122Kg 9:35 But when they went out to bury her, they did not find anything but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
122Kg 9:36 So they went back and told him, and he said, "This [fulfills] the LORD's word that He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite: 'In the plot of land at Jezreel, the dogs will eat Jezebel's flesh.
122Kg 9:37 Jezebel's corpse will be like manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land at Jezreel so that no one will [be able] to say: This is Jezebel.'"
122Kg 10:1 Since Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria, Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of Ahab's sons, saying:
122Kg 10:2 When this letter arrives, since your master's sons are with you and you have chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weaponry,
122Kg 10:3 select the most qualified of your master's sons, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
122Kg 10:4 However, they were terrified and reasoned, "Look, two kings couldn't stand against him; how can we?"
122Kg 10:5 So the overseer of the palace, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent [a message] to Jehu: "We are your servants, and we will do whatever you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever you think is right."
122Kg 10:6 Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying: If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, bring me the heads of your master's sons at this time tomorrow at Jezreel. All 70 of the king's sons were being cared for by the city's prominent men.
122Kg 10:7 When the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and slaughtered all 70, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
122Kg 10:8 When the messenger came and told him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," the king said, "Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning."
122Kg 10:9 The next morning when he went out and stood [at the gate], he said to all the people, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him. But who struck down all these?
122Kg 10:10 Know, then, that not a word the LORD spoke against the house of Ahab will fail, for the LORD has done what He promised through His servant Elijah."
122Kg 10:11 So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel-- all his great men, close friends, and priests-- leaving him no survivors.
122Kg 10:12 Then he set out and went on his way to Samaria. On the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
122Kg 10:13 Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They answered, "We're Ahaziah's relatives. We've come down to greet the king's sons and the queen mother's sons."
122Kg 10:14 Then Jehu ordered, "Take them alive." So they took them alive and then slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked-- 42 men. He didn't spare any of them.
122Kg 10:15 When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab [coming] to meet him. He greeted him and then asked, "Is your heart one with mine?" "It is," Jehonadab replied. Jehu said, "If it is, give me your hand." So he gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot with him.
122Kg 10:16 Then he said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD!" So he let him ride with him in his chariot.
122Kg 10:17 When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained from [the house of] Ahab in Samaria until he had annihilated his house, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.
122Kg 10:18 Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot.
122Kg 10:19 Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. None must be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing will not live." However, Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
122Kg 10:20 Jehu commanded, "Consecrate a solemn assembly for Baal." So they called one.
122Kg 10:21 Then Jehu sent [messengers] throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man left who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from one end to the other.
122Kg 10:22 Then he said to the custodian of the wardrobe, "Bring out the garments for all the servants of Baal." So he brought out their garments.
122Kg 10:23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, "Look carefully to see that there are no servants of the LORD here among you-- only servants of Baal."
122Kg 10:24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed 80 men outside, and he warned [them], "Whoever allows any of the men I am delivering into your hands to escape [will forfeit] his life for theirs."
122Kg 10:25 When he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, "Go in and kill them. Don't let anyone out." So they struck them down with the sword. Then the guards and officers threw [the bodies] out and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.
122Kg 10:26 They brought out the pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them
122Kg 10:27 and tore down the pillar of Baal. Then they tore down the temple of Baal and made it a latrine-- [which it is] to this day.
122Kg 10:28 Jehu eliminated Baal [worship] from Israel,
122Kg 10:29 but he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit-- [worshiping] the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
122Kg 10:30 Nevertheless, the LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel."
122Kg 10:31 Yet, Jehu was not careful to follow with all his heart the law of the LORD God of Israel. He did not turn from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 10:32 In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory:
122Kg 10:33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead-- the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites-- from Aroer which is by the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan.
122Kg 10:34 Now the rest of the events of Jehu's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and all his might, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 10:35 Jehu rested with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz became king in his place.
122Kg 10:36 The length of Jehu's reign over Israel in Samaria was 28 years.
122Kg 11:1 When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs.
122Kg 11:2 Jehosheba, [who was] King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, secretly rescued Joash son of Ahaziah from the king's sons who were being killed and [put] him and his nurse in a bedroom. So he was hidden from Athaliah and was not killed.
122Kg 11:3 Joash was in hiding with Jehosheba in the LORD's temple six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
122Kg 11:4 Then, in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent [messengers] and brought in the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards. He had them come to him in the LORD's temple, where he made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king's son
122Kg 11:5 and commanded them, "This is what you are to do: one third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath are to provide protection for the king's palace.
122Kg 11:6 A third are to be at the Sur gate and a third at the gate behind the guards. You are to take turns providing protection for the palace.
122Kg 11:7 Your two divisions that go off duty on the Sabbath are to provide protection for the LORD's temple.
122Kg 11:8 You must completely surround the king with weapons in hand. Anyone who approaches the ranks is to be put to death. You must be with the king in all his daily tasks."
122Kg 11:9 So the commanders of hundreds did everything Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each brought their men-- those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty-- and went to Jehoiada the priest.
122Kg 11:10 The priest gave to the commanders of hundreds King David's spears and shields that were in the LORD's temple.
122Kg 11:11 Then the guards stood with their weapons in hand surrounding the king-- from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple.
122Kg 11:12 He brought out the king's son, put the crown on him, gave him the testimony,and made him king. They anointed him and clapped their hands and cried, "Long live the king!"
122Kg 11:13 When Athaliah heard the noise from the guard [and] the crowd, she went out to the people at the LORD's temple.
122Kg 11:14 As she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar according to the custom. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed "Treason! Treason!"
122Kg 11:15 Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, "Take her out between the ranks, and put anyone who follows her to death by the sword," for the priest had said, "She is not to be put to death in the LORD's temple."
122Kg 11:16 So they arrested her, and she went out by way of the Horses' Entrance to the king's palace, where she was put to death.
122Kg 11:17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD's people and [another one] between the king and the people.
122Kg 11:18 So all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They broke its altars and images into pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, at the altars. Then [Jehoiada] the priest appointed guards for the LORD's temple.
122Kg 11:19 He took [with him] the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from the LORD's temple. They entered the king's palace by way of the guards' gate. Then Joash sat on the throne of the kings.
122Kg 11:20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death by the sword in the king's palace.
122Kg 11:21  Joash was seven years old when he became king.
122Kg 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king; he reigned 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, who was from Beer-sheba.
122Kg 12:2 Throughout the time Jehoiada the priest instructed him, Joash did what was right in the LORD's sight.
122Kg 12:3 Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
122Kg 12:4 Then Joash said to the priests, "All the dedicated money brought to the LORD's temple, census money, money from vows, and all money voluntarily given for the LORD's temple,
122Kg 12:5 each priest is to take from his assessor and repair whatever damage to the temple is found.
122Kg 12:6 But by the twenty-third year [of the reign] of King Joash, the priests had not repaired the damage to the temple.
122Kg 12:7 So King Joash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said, "Why haven't you repaired the temple's damage? Since you haven't, don't take any money from your assessors; instead, hand it over for the repair of the temple."
122Kg 12:8 So the priests agreed they would not take money from the people and they would not repair the temple's damage.
122Kg 12:9 Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the LORD's temple; in it the priests who guarded the threshold put all the money brought into the LORD's temple.
122Kg 12:10 Whenever they saw there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go to the LORD's temple and count the money found there and tie it up in bags.
122Kg 12:11 Then they would put the counted money into the hands of those doing the work-- those who oversaw the LORD's temple. They [in turn] would pay it out to those working on the LORD's temple-- the carpenters, the builders,
122Kg 12:12 the masons, and the stonecutters-- and [would use it] to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the damage to the LORD's temple and for all spending for temple repairs.
122Kg 12:13 However, no silver bowls, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver were made for the LORD's temple from the money brought into the temple.
122Kg 12:14 Instead, it was given to those doing the work, and they repaired the LORD's temple with it.
122Kg 12:15 No accounting was required from the men who received the money to pay those doing the work, since they worked with integrity.
122Kg 12:16 The money from the restitution offering and the sin offering was not brought to the LORD's temple since it belonged to the priests.
122Kg 12:17 At that time Hazael king of Aram marched up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he planned to attack Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:18 So King Joash of Judah took all the consecrated items that his ancestors-- Judah's kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah-- had consecrated, along with his own consecrated items and all the gold found in the treasuries of the LORD's temple and in the king's palace, and he sent [them] to Hazael king of Aram. Then Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:19 The rest of the events of Joash's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 12:20 Joash's servants conspired against him and killed him at Beth-millo [on the road that] goes down to Silla.
122Kg 12:21 His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer struck him down, and he died. Then they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and his son Amaziah became king in his place.
122Kg 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Judah's King Joash son of Ahaziah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria; [he reigned] 17 years.
122Kg 13:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
122Kg 13:3 So the LORD's anger burned against Israel, and He surrendered them to the power of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-hadad during their reigns.
122Kg 13:4 Then Jehoahaz sought the LORD's favor, and the LORD heard him, for He saw the oppression the king of Aram inflicted on Israel.
122Kg 13:5 Therefore, the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped from the power of the Arameans. Then the people of Israel dwelt in their tents as before,
122Kg 13:6 but they didn't turn away from the sins that the house of Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit. Jehoahaz walked in them, and the Asherah pole also remained standing in Samaria.
122Kg 13:7 Jehoahaz did not have an army left, except for 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers, because the king of Aram had destroyed them, making them like dust at threshing.
122Kg 13:8 The rest of the events of Jehoahaz's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and his might, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 13:9 Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoash became king in his place.
122Kg 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Judah's King Joash, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria; [he reigned] 16 years.
122Kg 13:11 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, but he walked in them.
122Kg 13:12 The rest of the events of Jehoash's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and the power he had to wage war against Judah's King Amaziah, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 13:13 Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
122Kg 13:14 When Elisha became sick with the illness that he died from, Jehoash king of Israel went down and wept over him and said, "My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!"
122Kg 13:15 Elisha responded, "Take a bow and arrows." So he got a bow and arrows.
122Kg 13:16 Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Put your hand on the bow." So the king put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.
122Kg 13:17 Elisha said, "Open the east window." So he opened it. Elisha said, "Shoot!" So he shot. Then Elisha said, "The LORD's arrow of victory, yes, the arrow of victory over Aram. You are to strike down the Arameans in Aphek until you have put an end to them."
122Kg 13:18 Then Elisha said, "Take the arrows!" So he took them, and he said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground!" So he struck the ground three times and stopped.
122Kg 13:19 The man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to them, but now you will only strike down Aram three times."
122Kg 13:20 Then Elisha died and was buried. Now marauding bands of Moabites used to come into the land in the spring of the year.
122Kg 13:21 Once, as the Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a marauding band, so they threw the man into Elisha's tomb. When he touched Elisha's bones, the man revived and stood up!
122Kg 13:22 Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz,
122Kg 13:23 but the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was not willing to destroy them. Even now He has not banished them from His presence.
122Kg 13:24 King Hazael of Aram died, and his son Ben-hadad became king in his place.
122Kg 13:25 Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in war from Jehoash's father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times and recovered the cities of Israel.
122Kg 14:1 In the second year of Israel's King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah.
122Kg 14:2 He was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan and was from Jerusalem.
122Kg 14:3 He did what was right in the LORD's sight, but not like his ancestor David. He did everything his father Joash had done.
122Kg 14:4 Yet, the high places were not taken away, and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
122Kg 14:5 As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah killed his servants who had murdered his father the king.
122Kg 14:6 However, he did not put the children of the murderers to death, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses where the LORD commanded, "Fathers must not be put to death because of children, and children must not be put to death because of fathers; instead, each one will be put to death for his own sin."
122Kg 14:7 Amaziah killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He took Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, [which is its name] to this very day.
122Kg 14:8 Amaziah then sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us meet face to face."
122Kg 14:9 King Jehoash of Israel sent [word] to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon once sent [a message] to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
122Kg 14:10 You have indeed defeated Edom, and you have become overconfident. Enjoy your glory and stay at home. Why should you stir up such trouble that you fall-- you and Judah with you?"
122Kg 14:11 But Amaziah would not listen, so King Jehoash of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced off at Beth-shemesh that belongs to Judah.
122Kg 14:12 Judah was routed before Israel, and [Judah's men] fled, each to his own tent.
122Kg 14:13 King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah's King Amaziah son of Joash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down 200 yards of Jerusalem's wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
122Kg 14:14 He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils found in the LORD's temple and in the treasuries of the king's palace, and the hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
122Kg 14:15 The rest of the events of Jehoash's [reign], along with his accomplishments, his might, and how he waged war against Amaziah king of Judah, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 14:16 Jehoash rested with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. His son Jeroboam became king in his place.
122Kg 14:17 Judah's King Amaziah son of Joash lived 15 years after the death of Israel's King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz.
122Kg 14:18 The rest of the events of Amaziah's [reign] are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 14:19 A conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. However, [men] were sent after him to Lachish, and they put him to death there.
122Kg 14:20 They carried him back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
122Kg 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
122Kg 14:22 He rebuilt Elathand restored it to Judah after [Amaziah] the king rested with his fathers.
122Kg 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Judah's King Amaziah son of Joash, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel in Samaria; he reigned 41 years.
122Kg 14:24 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He did not turn away from all the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 14:25 It was he who restored Israel's border from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word the LORD, the God of Israel, had spoken through His servant, the prophet Jonah son of Amittai from Gath-hepher.
122Kg 14:26 For the LORD saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter. There was no one to help Israel, neither bond nor free.
122Kg 14:27 However, the LORD had not said He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so He delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
122Kg 14:28 The rest of the events of Jeroboam's [reign]-- along with all his accomplishments and the power he had to wage war and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah-- are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 14:29 Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. His son Zechariah became king in his place.
122Kg 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of Israel's King Jeroboam, Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah.
122Kg 15:2 He was 16 years old when he became king; he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah; [she was] from Jerusalem.
122Kg 15:3 Azariah did what was right in the LORD's sight just as his father Amaziah had done.
122Kg 15:4 Yet, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
122Kg 15:5 The LORD afflicted the king, and he had a serious skin disease until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house,while Jotham, the king's son, was over the household governing the people of the land.
122Kg 15:6 The rest of the events of Azariah's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 15:7 Azariah rested with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His son Jotham became king in his place.
122Kg 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Judah's King Azariah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria for six months.
122Kg 15:9 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:10 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He struck him down publicly, killed him, and became king in his place.
122Kg 15:11 As for the rest of the events of Zechariah's [reign], they are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 15:12 The word of the LORD that He spoke to Jehu was, "Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel." And it was so.
122Kg 15:13 In the thirty-ninth year of Judah's King Uzziah, Shallum son of Jabesh became king; he reigned in Samaria a full month.
122Kg 15:14 Then Menahem son of Gadi came up from Tirzah to Samaria and struck down Shallum son of Jabesh there. He killed him and became king in his place.
122Kg 15:15 As for the rest of the events of Shallum's [reign], along with the conspiracy that he formed, they are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 15:16 At that time, [starting] from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were in it, and its territory. Because they wouldn't surrender, he attacked [it and] ripped open all the pregnant women.
122Kg 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Judah's King Azariah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel; [he reigned] 10 years in Samaria.
122Kg 15:18 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight. Throughout his reign, he did not turn away from the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:19 Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, so Menahem gave Pul 75,000 pounds of silver so that Pul would support him to strengthen his grip on the kingdom.
122Kg 15:20 Then Menahem exacted 20 ounces of silver from each of the wealthy men of Israel to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not stay there in the land.
122Kg 15:21 The rest of the events of Menahem's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 15:22 Menahem rested with his fathers, and his son Pekahiah became king in his place.
122Kg 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Judah's King Azariah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria; [he reigned] two years.
122Kg 15:24 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight and did not turn away from the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:25 Then his officer, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him and struck him down, as well as Argob and Arieh, in Samaria at the citadel of the king's palace. There were 50 Gileadite men with Pekah. He killed Pekahiah and became king in his place.
122Kg 15:26 As for the rest of the events of Pekahiah's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, they are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Judah's King Azariah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria; [he reigned] 20 years.
122Kg 15:28 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He did not turn away from the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee-- all the land of Naphtali-- and deported the people to Assyria.
122Kg 15:30 Then Hoshea son of Elah organized a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remaliah. He attacked him, killed him, and became king in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
122Kg 15:31 As for the rest of the events of Pekah's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, they are written about in the Historical Record of Israel's Kings.
122Kg 15:32 In the second year of Israel's King Pekah son of Remaliah, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah.
122Kg 15:33 He was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
122Kg 15:34 He did what was right in the LORD's sight just as his father Uzziah had done.
122Kg 15:35 Yet, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. It was Jotham who built the Upper Gate of the LORD's temple.
122Kg 15:36 The rest of the events of Jotham's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 15:37 In those days the LORD began sending Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
122Kg 15:38 Jotham rested with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of his ancestor David. His son Ahaz became king in his place.
122Kg 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah.
122Kg 16:2 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king; he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God like his ancestor David
122Kg 16:3 but walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even made his son pass through the fire, imitating the abominations of the nations the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
122Kg 16:4 He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
122Kg 16:5 Then Aram's King Rezin and Israel's King Pekah son of Remaliah came to wage war against Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz but were not able to conquer him.
122Kg 16:6 At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram and expelled the Judahites from Elath. Then the Arameans came to Elath, and they live there until today.
122Kg 16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son. March up and save me from the power of the king of Aram and of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me."
122Kg 16:8 Ahaz also took the silver and gold found in the LORD's temple and in the treasuries of the king's palace and sent [them] to the king of Assyria as a gift.
122Kg 16:9 So the king of Assyria listened to him and marched up to Damascus and captured it. He deported its people to Kir but put Rezin to death.
122Kg 16:10 King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria. When he saw the altar that was in Damascus, King Ahaz sent a model of the altar and complete plans for its construction to Uriah the priest.
122Kg 16:11 Uriah built the altar according to all [the instructions] King Ahaz sent from Damascus. Therefore, by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus, Uriah the priest had made it.
122Kg 16:12 When the king came back from Damascus, he saw the altar. Then he approached the altar and ascended it.
122Kg 16:13 He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
122Kg 16:14 He took the bronze altar that was before the LORD in front of the temple between [his] altar and the LORD's temple, and put it on the north side of [his] altar.
122Kg 16:15 Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, "Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, and the king's burnt offering and his grain offering. [Also offer] the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of sacrifice. The bronze altar will be for me to seek guidance."
122Kg 16:16 Uriah the priest did everything King Ahaz commanded.
122Kg 16:17 Then King Ahaz cut off the frames of the water carts and removed the bronze basin from [each of] them. He took the reservoirfrom the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone pavement.
122Kg 16:18 To satisfy the king of Assyria, he removed from the LORD's temple the Sabbath canopy they had built in the palace, and [he closed] the outer entrance for the king.
122Kg 16:19 The rest of the events of Ahaz's [reign], along with his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 16:20 Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
122Kg 17:1 In the twelfth year of Judah's King Ahaz, Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria; [he reigned] nine years.
122Kg 17:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.
122Kg 17:3 Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute money.
122Kg 17:4 But the king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy by Hoshea-- he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt and had not paid tribute money to the king of Assyria as in previous years. Therefore, the king of Assyria arrested him and put him in prison.
122Kg 17:5 Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
122Kg 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan's river, and in the cities of the Medes.
122Kg 17:7 [This disaster] happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt and because they had worshiped other gods.
122Kg 17:8 They had lived according to the customs of the nations that the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites and the customs the kings of Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:9 The Israelites secretly did what was not right against the LORD their God. They built high places in all their towns from watchtower to fortified city.
122Kg 17:10 They set up for themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
122Kg 17:11 They burned incense on all the high places just like those nations that the LORD had driven out before them. They did evil things, provoking the LORD.
122Kg 17:12 They served idols, although the LORD had told them, "You must not do this."
122Kg 17:13 Still, the LORD warned Israel and Judah through every prophet and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments and statutes according to all the law I commanded your ancestors and sent to you through My servants the prophets."
122Kg 17:14 But they would not listen. Instead, they became obstinate like their ancestors who did not believe the LORD their God.
122Kg 17:15 They rejected His statutes and His covenant He had made with their ancestors and the warnings He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and became worthless themselves, following the surrounding nations the LORD had commanded them not to imitate.
122Kg 17:16 They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God. They made for themselves molded images-- even two calves-- and an Asherah pole. They worshiped the whole heavenly host and served Baal.
122Kg 17:17 They made their sons and daughters pass through the fire and practiced divination and interpreted omens. They devoted themselves to do what was evil in the LORD's sight and provoked Him.
122Kg 17:18 Therefore, the LORD was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained.
122Kg 17:19 Even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:20 So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and handed them over to plunderers until He had banished them from His presence.
122Kg 17:21 When the LORD tore Israel from the house of David, Israel made Jeroboam son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit great sin.
122Kg 17:22 The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam committed and did not turn away from them.
122Kg 17:23 Finally, the LORD removed Israel from His presence just as He had declared through all His servants the prophets. So Israel has been exiled to Assyria from their homeland until today.
122Kg 17:24 Then the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in place of the Israelites in the cities of Samaria. The settlers took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
122Kg 17:25 When they first lived there, they did not fear the LORD. So the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
122Kg 17:26 The settlers spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations that you have deported and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the God of the land. Therefore, He has sent lions among them, which are killing them because the people don't know the custom of the God of the land."
122Kg 17:27 Then the king of Assyria issued a command: "Send back one of the priests you deported. Have him go and live there so he can teach them the custom of the God of the land."
122Kg 17:28 So one of the priests they had deported came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should fear the LORD.
122Kg 17:29 But [the people of] each nation, in the cities where they lived, were still making their own gods and putting them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans had made.
122Kg 17:30 The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
122Kg 17:31 the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim.
122Kg 17:32 So they feared the LORD, but they also appointed from their number, priests to serve them in the shrines of the high places.
122Kg 17:33 They feared the LORD, but they also worshiped their own gods according to the custom of the nations where they had been deported from.
122Kg 17:34 They are [still] practicing the former customs to this day. None of them fear the LORD or observe their statutes and ordinances, the law and commandments the LORD commanded the descendants of Jacob; He renamed him Israel.
122Kg 17:35 The LORD made a covenant with them and commanded them, "Do not fear other gods; do not bow down to them; do not serve them; do not sacrifice to them.
122Kg 17:36 Instead, fear the LORD, who brought you from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him, and you are to sacrifice to Him.
122Kg 17:37 You are to be careful always to observe the statutes, the ordinances, the laws, and the commandment He wrote for you; do not fear other gods.
122Kg 17:38 Do not forget the covenant that I have made with you. Do not fear other gods,
122Kg 17:39 but fear the LORD your God, and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
122Kg 17:40 However, they would not listen but continued practicing their former custom.
122Kg 17:41 These nations feared the LORD but also served their idols. Their children and grandchildren continue doing as their fathers did until today.
122Kg 18:1 In the third year of Israel's King Hoshea son of Elah, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah.
122Kg 18:2 He was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi daughter of Zechariah.
122Kg 18:3 He did what was right in the LORD's sight just as his ancestor David had done.
122Kg 18:4 He removed the high places and shattered the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah [poles]. He broke into pieces the bronze snake that Moses made, for the Israelites burned incense to it up to that time. He called it Nehushtan.
122Kg 18:5 Hezekiah trusted in the LORD God of Israel; not one of the kings of Judah was like him, either before him or after him.
122Kg 18:6 He held fast to the LORD and did not turn from following Him but kept the commandments the LORD had commanded Moses.
122Kg 18:7 The LORD was with him, and wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
122Kg 18:8 He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city.
122Kg 18:9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Israel's King Hoshea son of Elah, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and besieged it.
122Kg 18:10 The Assyrians captured it at the end of three years. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Israel's King Hoshea, Samaria was captured.
122Kg 18:11 The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria and put them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan's river, and in the cities of the Medes,
122Kg 18:12 because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God but violated His covenant-- all He had commanded Moses the servant of the LORD. They did not listen, and they did not obey.
122Kg 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
122Kg 18:14 So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me. Whatever you demand from me, I will pay." The king of Assyria demanded from King Hezekiah of Judah 11 tons of silver and one ton of gold.
122Kg 18:15 So Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver found in the LORD's temple and in the treasuries of the king's palace.
122Kg 18:16 At that time Hezekiah stripped [the gold from] the doors of the LORD's sanctuary and from the doorposts he had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 18:17 Then the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh, along with a massive army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced and came to Jerusalem, and they took their position by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the highway to the Fuller's Field.
122Kg 18:18 Then they called for the king, but Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebnah the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came out to them.
122Kg 18:19 Then the Rabshakeh said to them, "Tell Hezekiah this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: 'What are you relying on?
122Kg 18:20 You think mere words are strategy and strength for war. What are you now relying on so that you have rebelled against me?
122Kg 18:21 Look, you now trust in Egypt, the stalk of this splintered reed, which if a man leans on it will go into his palm and pierce it. This is how Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him.
122Kg 18:22 Suppose you say to me: We trust in the LORD our God. Isn't He the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem: You must worship at this altar in Jerusalem?'
122Kg 18:23 "So now make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria. I'll give you 2,000 horses if you're able to supply riders for them!
122Kg 18:24 How then can you drive back a single officer among the least of my master's servants and trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
122Kg 18:25 Have I attacked this place to destroy it without the LORD's [approval]? The LORD said to me, 'Attack this land and destroy it.'"
122Kg 18:26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand [it]. Don't speak with us in Hebrew within earshot of the people on the wall."
122Kg 18:27 But the Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words? Hasn't [he] also [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, [destined] with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?"
122Kg 18:28 The Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew. Then he spoke: "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
122Kg 18:29 This is what the king says: 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you; he can't deliver you from my hand.
122Kg 18:30 Don't let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD by saying: Certainly the LORD will deliver us! This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
122Kg 18:31 "Don't listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make peace with me and surrender to me. Then every one of you may eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and every one may drink water from his own cistern
122Kg 18:32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land-- a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey-- so that you may live and not die. But don't listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying: The LORD will deliver us.
122Kg 18:33 Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land from the power of the king of Assyria?
122Kg 18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
122Kg 18:35 Who among all the gods of the lands has delivered his land from my power? So how is the LORD to deliver Jerusalem?'"
122Kg 18:36 But the people kept silent; they answered him not a word, for the king's command was, "Don't answer him."
122Kg 18:37 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of the Rabshakeh.
122Kg 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard [their report], he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the LORD's temple.
122Kg 19:2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
122Kg 19:3 They said to him, "This is what Hezekiah says: 'Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver [them].
122Kg 19:4 Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke [him for] the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the surviving remnant.'"
122Kg 19:5 So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
122Kg 19:6 who said to them, "Tell your master this, 'The LORD says: Don't be afraid because of the words you have heard, that the king of Assyria's attendants have blasphemed Me with.
122Kg 19:7 I am about to put a spirit in him, and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land where I will cause him to fall by the sword.'"
122Kg 19:8 When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he returned and found him fighting against Libnah.
122Kg 19:9 The king had heard this about Tirhakah king of Cush: "Look, he has set out to fight against you." So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
122Kg 19:10 "Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: 'Don't let your God, whom you trust, deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 19:11 Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: they destroyed them completely. Will you be rescued?
122Kg 19:12 Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed rescue them-- [nations such as] Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar?
122Kg 19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah?'"
122Kg 19:14 Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, read it, then went up to the LORD's temple, and spread it out before the LORD.
122Kg 19:15 Then Hezekiah prayed before the LORD: "LORD God of Israel who is enthroned [above] the cherubim, You are God-- You alone-- of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
122Kg 19:16 Listen closely, LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, LORD, and see; hear the words that Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God.
122Kg 19:17 LORD, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands.
122Kg 19:18 They have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but made by human hands-- wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
122Kg 19:19 Now, LORD our God, please save us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD God-- You alone."
122Kg 19:20 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent [a message] to Hezekiah: "The LORD, the God of Israel says: 'I have heard your prayer to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria.'
122Kg 19:21 This is the word the LORD has spoken against him: The young woman, Daughter Zion, despises you and scorns you: Daughter Jerusalem shakes [her] head behind your back.
122Kg 19:22 Who is it you mocked and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised [your] voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
122Kg 19:23 You have mocked the Lord through your messengers. You have said: With my many chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars, its choice cypress trees. I came to its farthest outpost, its densest forest.
122Kg 19:24 I dug [wells], and I drank foreign waters. I dried up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.
122Kg 19:25 Have you not heard? I designed it long ago; I planned it in days gone by. I have now brought it to pass, and you have crushed fortified cities into piles of rubble.
122Kg 19:26 Their inhabitants have become powerless, dismayed, and ashamed. They are plants of the field, tender grass, grass on the rooftops, blasted by the east wind.
122Kg 19:27 But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me.
122Kg 19:28 Because your raging against Me and your arrogance have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will make you go back the way you came.
122Kg 19:29 This will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what grows from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
122Kg 19:30 The surviving remnant of the house of Israel will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
122Kg 19:31 For a remnant will go out from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
122Kg 19:32 Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or build up an assault ramp against it.
122Kg 19:33 He will go back on the road that he came and he will not enter this city, declares the LORD.
122Kg 19:34 I will defend this city and rescue it for My sake and for the sake of My servant David.
122Kg 19:35 That night the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the [next] morning-- there were all the dead bodies!
122Kg 19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned [home] and lived in Nineveh.
122Kg 19:37 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. Then his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.
122Kg 20:1 In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Put your affairs in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.'"
122Kg 20:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
122Kg 20:3 "Please LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and wholeheartedly and have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
122Kg 20:4 Isaiah had not yet gone out of the inner courtyard when the word of the LORD came to him:
122Kg 20:5 "Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of My people, 'This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will heal you. On the third day [from now] you will go up to the LORD's temple.
122Kg 20:6 I will add 15 years to your life. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for My sake and for the sake of My servant David.'"
122Kg 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Bring a lump of pressed figs." So they brought it and applied it to his infected skin, and he recovered.
122Kg 20:8 Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What is the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the LORD's temple on the third day?"
122Kg 20:9 Isaiah said, "This is the sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: Should the shadow go ahead 10 steps or go back 10 steps?"
122Kg 20:10 Then Hezekiah answered, "It's easy for the shadow to lengthen 10 steps. No, let the shadow go back 10 steps."
122Kg 20:11 So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD, and He brought the shadow back the 10 steps it had descended on Ahaz's stairway.
122Kg 20:12 At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah since he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
122Kg 20:13 Hezekiah gave them a hearing and showed them his whole treasure house-- the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil-- and his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace and in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
122Kg 20:14 Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come to you from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant country, from Babylon."
122Kg 20:15 Isaiah asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything in my palace. There isn't anything in my treasuries that I didn't show them."
122Kg 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD:
122Kg 20:17 'The time will certainly come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,' says the LORD.
122Kg 20:18 'Some of your descendants who come from you will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
122Kg 20:19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good," for he thought: Why not, if there will be peace and security during my lifetime?
122Kg 20:20 The rest of the events of Hezekiah's [reign], along with all his might and how he made the pool and the tunnel and brought water into the city, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 20:21 Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
122Kg 21:1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king; he reigned 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
122Kg 21:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, imitating the abominations of the nations that the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
122Kg 21:3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed and reestablished the altars for Baal. He made an Asherah, as King Ahab of Israel had done; he also worshiped the whole heavenly host and served them.
122Kg 21:4 He would build altars in the LORD's temple, where the LORD had said, "Jerusalem is where I will put My name."
122Kg 21:5 He built altars to the whole heavenly host in both courtyards of the LORD's temple.
122Kg 21:6 He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did a great amount of evil in the LORD's sight, provoking [Him].
122Kg 21:7 Manasseh set up the carved image of Asherah he made in the temple that the LORD had spoken about to David and his son Solomon, "I will establish My name forever in this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
122Kg 21:8 I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land I gave to their ancestors if only they will be careful to do all I have commanded them-- the whole law that My servant Moses commanded them."
122Kg 21:9 But they did not listen; Manasseh caused them to stray so that they did greater evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
122Kg 21:10 The LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,
122Kg 21:11 "Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed all these abominations-- greater evil than the Amorites who preceded him had done-- and by means of his idols has also caused Judah to sin,
122Kg 21:12 this is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I am about to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that everyone who hears about it will shudder.
122Kg 21:13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line [used on] Samaria and the mason's level [used on] the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem clean as one wipes a bowl-- wiping it and turning it upside down.
122Kg 21:14 I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. They will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
122Kg 21:15 because they have done what is evil in My sight and have provoked Me from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until today.'"
122Kg 21:16 Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem with it from one end to another. This was in addition to his sin he caused Judah to commit so that they did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
122Kg 21:17 The rest of the events of Manasseh's [reign], along with all his accomplishments and the sin that he committed, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 21:18 Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, the garden of Uzza. His son Amon became king in his place.
122Kg 21:19 Amon was 22 years old when he became king; he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; [she was] from Jotbah.
122Kg 21:20 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight as his father Manasseh had done.
122Kg 21:21 He walked in all the ways his father had walked; he served the idols his father had served, and he worshiped them.
122Kg 21:22 He abandoned the LORD God of his ancestors and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
122Kg 21:23 Amon's servants conspired against the king and killed him in his own house.
122Kg 21:24 Then the common people executed all those who had conspired against King Amon and made his son Josiah king in his place.
122Kg 21:25 The rest of the events of Amon's [reign], along with his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 21:26 He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.
122Kg 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king; he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah; [she was] from Bozkath.
122Kg 22:2 He did what was right in the LORD's sight and walked in all the ways of his ancestor David; he did not turn to the right or the left.
122Kg 22:3 In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent the court secretary Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, to the LORD's temple, saying,
122Kg 22:4 "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest so that he may total up the money brought into the LORD's temple-- [the money] the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
122Kg 22:5 It is to be put into the hands of those doing the work-- those who oversee the LORD's temple. They [in turn] are to give it to the workmen in the LORD's temple to repair the damage.
122Kg 22:6 [They are to give it] to the carpenters, builders, and masons to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the temple.
122Kg 22:7 But no accounting is to be required from them for the money put into their hands since they work with integrity."
122Kg 22:8 Hilkiah the high priest told Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the LORD's temple," and he gave the book to Shaphan, who read it.
122Kg 22:9 Then Shaphan the court secretary went to the king and reported, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the temple and have put it into the hand of those doing the work-- those who oversee the LORD's temple."
122Kg 22:10 Then Shaphan the court secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book," and Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
122Kg 22:11 When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.
122Kg 22:12 Then he commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the court secretary, and the king's servant Asaiah:
122Kg 22:13 "Go and inquire of the LORD for me, the people, and all Judah about the instruction in this book that has been found. For great is the LORD's wrath that is kindled against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words of this book in order to do everything written about us."
122Kg 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah, wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second District. They spoke with her.
122Kg 22:15 She said to them, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says, 'Say to the man who sent you to Me:
122Kg 22:16 This is what the LORD says: I am about to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, [fulfilling] all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read,
122Kg 22:17 because they have abandoned Me and burned incense to other gods in order to provoke Me with all the work of their hands. My wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.
122Kg 22:18 Say this to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD: This is what the LORD God of Israel says: As for the words that you heard,
122Kg 22:19 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I Myself have heard you-- declares the LORD.
122Kg 22:20 Therefore, I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster that I am bringing on this place.'" Then they reported to the king.
122Kg 23:1 So the king sent [messengers], and they gathered to him all the elders of Jerusalem and Judah.
122Kg 23:2 Then the king went to the LORD's temple with all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the prophets-- all the people from the youngest to the oldest. As they listened, he read all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the LORD's temple.
122Kg 23:3 Next, the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant in the presence of the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, His decrees, and His statutes with all his mind and with all his heart, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book; all the people agreed to the covenant.
122Kg 23:4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers to bring out of the LORD's temple all the articles made for Baal, Asherah, and the whole heavenly host. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.
122Kg 23:5 Then he did away with the idolatrous priests the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense at the high places in the cities of Judah and in the areas surrounding Jerusalem. They had burned incense to Baal, and to the sun, moon, constellations, and the whole heavenly host.
122Kg 23:6 He brought out the Asherah pole from the LORD's temple to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem. He burned it at the Kidron Valley, beat it to dust, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.
122Kg 23:7 He also tore down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the LORD's temple, in which the women were weaving tapestries for Asherah.
122Kg 23:8 Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and he defiled the high places from Geba to Beer-sheba, where the priests had burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city (on the left at the city gate).
122Kg 23:9 The priests of the high places, however, did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem; instead, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
122Kg 23:10 He defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of Hinnom, so that no one could make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech.
122Kg 23:11 He did away with the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. [They had been] at the entrance of the LORD's temple in the precincts by the chamber of Nathan-melech the court official, and he burned up the chariots of the sun.
122Kg 23:12 The king tore down the altars that were on the roof-- Ahaz's upper chamber that the kings of Judah had made-- and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the LORD's temple. Then he smashed them there and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley.
122Kg 23:13 The king also defiled the high places that were across from Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Destruction, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the detestable idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the detestable idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites.
122Kg 23:14 He broke the sacred pillars into pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, then filled their places with human bones.
122Kg 23:15 He even tore down the altar at Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made. Then he burned the high place, crushed it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
122Kg 23:16 As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mountain. He sent [someone] to take the bones out of the tombs, and he burned them on the altar. He defiled it according to the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who proclaimed these things.
122Kg 23:17 Then he said, "What is this monument I see?" The men of the city told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done to the altar at Bethel."
122Kg 23:18 So he said, "Let him rest. Don't let anyone disturb his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.
122Kg 23:19 Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [the LORD]. Josiah did the same things to them that he had done at Bethel.
122Kg 23:20 He slaughtered on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there, and he burned human bones on the altars. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:21 The king commanded all the people, "Keep the Passover of the LORD your God as written in the book of the covenant."
122Kg 23:22 No such Passover had ever been kept from the time of the judges who judged Israel through the entire time of the kings of Israel and Judah.
122Kg 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:24 In addition, Josiah removed the mediums, the spiritists, household idols, images, and all the detestable things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this in order to carry out the words of the law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the LORD's temple.
122Kg 23:25 Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his mind and with all his heart and with all his strength according to all the law of Moses, and no one like him arose after him.
122Kg 23:26 In spite of all that, the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath and anger, which burned against Judah because of all the provocations Manasseh had provoked Him with.
122Kg 23:27 For the LORD had said, "I will also remove Judah from My sight just as I have removed Israel. I will reject this city Jerusalem, that I have chosen, and the temple about which I said, 'My name will be there.'"
122Kg 23:28 The rest of the events of Josiah's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 23:29 During his reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt marched up to the king of Assyria at the Euphrates river. King Josiah went to confront him, and at Megiddo when Neco saw him he killed him.
122Kg 23:30 From Megiddo his servants carried his dead body in a chariot, brought him into Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the common people took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
122Kg 23:31 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; [she was] from Libnah.
122Kg 23:32 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight just as his ancestors had done.
122Kg 23:33 Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath to keep him from reigning in Jerusalem, and he imposed on the land a fine of 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold.
122Kg 23:34 Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz and went to Egypt, and he died there.
122Kg 23:35 So Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but at Pharaoh's command he taxed the land to give the money. He exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, each man according to his valuation, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
122Kg 23:36 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; [she was] from Rumah.
122Kg 23:37 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight just as his ancestors had done.
122Kg 24:1 During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him.
122Kg 24:2 The LORD sent Chaldean, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Jehoiakim. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD He had spoken through His servants the prophets.
122Kg 24:3 This happened to Israel only at the LORD's command to remove them from His sight. It was because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all he had done,
122Kg 24:4 and also because of all the innocent blood he had shed. He had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD would not forgive.
122Kg 24:5 The rest of the events of Jehoiakim's [reign], along with all his accomplishments, are written about in the Historical Record of Judah's Kings.
122Kg 24:6 Jehoiakim rested with his fathers, and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
122Kg 24:7 Now the king of Egypt did not march out of his land again, for the king of Babylon took everything that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
122Kg 24:8 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; [she was] from Jerusalem.
122Kg 24:9 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight as his father had done.
122Kg 24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege.
122Kg 24:11 Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it.
122Kg 24:12 Jehoiachin king of Judah, along with his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials, surrendered to the king of Babylon. So the king of Babylon took him [captive] in the eighth year of his reign.
122Kg 24:13 He also carried off from there all the treasures of the LORD's temple and the treasures of the king's palace, and he cut into pieces all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the LORD's sanctuary, just as God had predicted.
122Kg 24:14 Then he deported all Jerusalem and all the commanders and all the fighting men, 10,000 captives, and all the craftsmen and metalsmiths. Except for the poorest people of the land, nobody remained.
122Kg 24:15 Nebuchadnezzar deported Jehoiachin to Babylon. Also, he took the king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
122Kg 24:16 The king of Babylon also brought captive into Babylon all 7,000 fighting men and 1,000 craftsmen and metalsmiths-- all strong and fit for war.
122Kg 24:17 Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
122Kg 24:18 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king; he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; [she was] from Libnah.
122Kg 24:19 Zedekiah did what was evil in the LORD's sight just as Jehoiakim had done.
122Kg 24:20 Because of the LORD's anger, it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He finally banished them from His presence. Then, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
122Kg 25:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army. They laid siege to the city and built a siege wall against it all around.
122Kg 25:2 The city was under siege until King Zedekiah's eleventh year.
122Kg 25:3 By the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was so severe in the city that the people of the land had no food.
122Kg 25:4 Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors [fled] by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, even though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. As the king made his way along the route to the Arabah,
122Kg 25:5 the Chaldean army pursued him and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. Zedekiah's entire army was scattered from him.
122Kg 25:6 The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him.
122Kg 25:7 They slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes. Finally, the king of Babylon blinded Zedekiah, bound him in bronze [chains], and took him to Babylon.
122Kg 25:8 On the seventh day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
122Kg 25:9 He burned the LORD's temple, the king's palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; he burned down all the great houses.
122Kg 25:10 The whole Chaldean army [with] the commander of the guards tore down the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
122Kg 25:11 Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population.
122Kg 25:12 But the commander of the guards left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
122Kg 25:13 Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars of the LORD's temple, the water carts, and the bronze reservoir, which were in the LORD's temple, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
122Kg 25:14 They also took the pots, the shovels, the wick trimmers, the dishes, and all the bronze articles used in [temple] service.
122Kg 25:15 The commander of the guards took away the firepans and the sprinkling basins-- whatever was gold or silver.
122Kg 25:16 As for the two pillars, the one reservoir, and the water carts that Solomon had made for the LORD's temple, the weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.
122Kg 25:17 One pillar was 27 feet tall and had a bronze capital on top of it. The capital, encircled by a grating and pomegranates of bronze, stood five feet high. The second pillar was the same, with its own grating.
122Kg 25:18 The commander of the guards also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
122Kg 25:19 From the city he took a court official who had been appointed over the warriors; five trusted royal aides found in the city; the secretary of the commander of the army, who enlisted the people of the land for military duty; and 60 men from the common people who were found within the city.
122Kg 25:20 Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
122Kg 25:21 The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.
122Kg 25:22 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, over the rest of the people he left in the land of Judah.
122Kg 25:23 When all the commanders of the armies-- they and their men-- heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. [The commanders included] Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite-- they and their men.
122Kg 25:24 Gedaliah swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, "Don't be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you."
122Kg 25:25 In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with 10 men and struck down Gedaliah, and he died. Also, [they killed] the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
122Kg 25:26 Then all the people, from the youngest to the oldest, and the commanders of the army, left and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
122Kg 25:27 On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah's King Jehoiachin, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year he became king, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah [and released him] from prison.
122Kg 25:28 He spoke kindly to him and set his throne over the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
122Kg 25:29 So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly in the presence of the king of Babylon for the rest of his life.
122Kg 25:30 As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king, a portion for each day, for the rest of his life.

131Ch 10:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!" But his armor-bearer wouldn't do it because he was terrified. Then Saul took his sword and fell on it.
131Ch 10:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died.
131Ch 10:6 So Saul and his three sons died-- his whole house died together.
131Ch 10:7 When all the men of Israel in the valley saw that the army had run away and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. So the Philistines came and settled in them.
131Ch 10:8 The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
131Ch 10:9 They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the good news to their idols and their people.
131Ch 10:10 Then they put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his skull in the temple of Dagon.
131Ch 10:11 When all Jabesh-gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
131Ch 10:12 all their brave men set out and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
131Ch 10:13 Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD because he did not keep the LORD's word. He even consulted a medium for guidance,
131Ch 10:14 but he did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
131Ch 11:1 All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, "Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
131Ch 11:2 Even when Saul was king, you led us out [to battle] and brought us back. The LORD your God also said to you, 'You will shepherd My people Israel and be ruler over My people Israel.'"
131Ch 11:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the LORD's presence, and they anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the LORD's word through Samuel.
131Ch 11:4 David and all Israel marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); the Jebusites who inhabited the land were there.
131Ch 11:5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You will never get in here." Yet David did capture the stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David).
131Ch 11:6 David said, "Whoever is the first to kill a Jebusite will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became the chief.
131Ch 11:7 Then David took up residence in the stronghold; therefore, it was called the city of David.
131Ch 11:8 He built up the city all the way around, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding parts, and Joab restored the rest of the city.
131Ch 11:9 David steadily grew more powerful, and the LORD of Hosts was with him.
131Ch 11:10 The following were the chiefs of David's warriors who, together with all Israel, strongly supported him in his reign to make him king according to the LORD's word about Israel.
131Ch 11:11 This is the list of David's warriors: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the Thirty; he wielded his spear against 300 and killed them at one time.
131Ch 11:12 After him, Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite was one of the three warriors.
131Ch 11:13 He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines had gathered there for battle. A plot of ground full of barley was there, where the troops had fled from the Philistines.
131Ch 11:14 But Eleazar and David took their stand in the middle of the plot and defended it. They killed the Philistines, and the LORD gave them a great victory.
131Ch 11:15 Three of the 30 chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine army was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
131Ch 11:16 At that time David was in the stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
131Ch 11:17 David was extremely thirsty and said, "If only someone would bring me water from the well at the city gate of Bethlehem!"
131Ch 11:18 So the Three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the LORD.
131Ch 11:19 David said, "I would never do such a thing in the presence of God! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?" For they brought it at the risk of their lives. So he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three warriors.
131Ch 11:20 Abishai, Joab's brother, was the leader of the Three. He raised his spear against 300 [men] and killed them, gaining a reputation among the Three.
131Ch 11:21 He was the most honored of the Three and became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.
131Ch 11:22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was the son of a brave man from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. Benaiah killed two [sons of] Ariel of Moab, and he went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
131Ch 11:23 He also killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Even though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like a weaver's beam, Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and then killed him with his own spear.
131Ch 11:24 These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors.
131Ch 11:25 He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
131Ch 11:26 The fighting men were: Joab's brother Asahel, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
131Ch 11:27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
131Ch 11:28 Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
131Ch 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
131Ch 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
131Ch 11:31 Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
131Ch 11:32 Hurai from the wadis of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
131Ch 11:33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
131Ch 11:34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
131Ch 11:35 Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
131Ch 11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
131Ch 11:37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
131Ch 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
131Ch 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah,
131Ch 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
131Ch 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
131Ch 11:42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites, and 30 with him,
131Ch 11:43 Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
131Ch 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
131Ch 11:45 Jediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,
131Ch 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
131Ch 11:47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
131Ch 12:1 The following were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still banned from the presence of Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who helped him in battle.
131Ch 12:2 They were archers who, using either their right or left hand, could [throw] stones [with a sling] or [shoot] arrows with a bow. They were Saul's relatives from Benjamin:
131Ch 12:3 Their chief was Ahiezer son of Shemaah the Gibeathite. Then there was his brother Joash; Jeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite;
131Ch 12:4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a warrior among the Thirty and [a leader] over the Thirty;Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite;
131Ch 12:5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
131Ch 12:6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
131Ch 12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
131Ch 12:8 Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were fighting men, trained for battle, expert with shield and spear. Their faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
131Ch 12:9 Ezer was the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third,
131Ch 12:10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
131Ch 12:11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
131Ch 12:12 Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
131Ch 12:13 Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh.
131Ch 12:14 These Gadites were army commanders; the least of them was a match for a hundred, and the greatest of them for a thousand.
131Ch 12:15 These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all [those in] the valleys to the east and to the west.
131Ch 12:16 Other Benjaminites and men from Judah also went to David at the stronghold.
131Ch 12:17 David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you, but if you have come to betray me to my enemies even though my hands have done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors look on it and judge."
131Ch 12:18 Then the Spirit took control of Amasai, chief of the Thirty, [and he said]: [We are] yours, David, [we are] with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to him who helps you, for your God helps you. So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
131Ch 12:19 Some Manassites defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. However, they did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers, following consultation, sent David away. They said, "It will be our heads if he defects to his master Saul."
131Ch 12:20 When David went to Ziklag, some men from Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
131Ch 12:21 They helped David against the marauders, for they were all brave warriors and commanders in the army.
131Ch 12:22 At that time, men came day after day to help David until there was a great army, like an army of God.
131Ch 12:23 The numbers of the armed troops who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, according to the LORD's word, were as follows:
131Ch 12:24 From the Judahites: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.
131Ch 12:25 From the Simeonites: 7,100 brave warriors ready for war.
131Ch 12:26 From the Levites: 4,600
131Ch 12:27 in addition to Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men;
131Ch 12:28 and Zadok, a young brave warrior, with 22 commanders from his own ancestral house.
131Ch 12:29 From the Benjaminites, the relatives of Saul: 3,000 (up to that time the majority of the Benjaminites maintained their allegiance to the house of Saul).
131Ch 12:30 From the Ephraimites: 20,800 brave warriors who were famous men in their ancestral houses.
131Ch 12:31 From half the tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
131Ch 12:32 From the Issacharites, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their relatives under their command.
131Ch 12:33 From Zebulun: 50,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, with singleness of purpose to help David.
131Ch 12:34 From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
131Ch 12:35 From the Danites: 28,600 trained for battle.
131Ch 12:36 From Asher: 40,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle.
131Ch 12:37 From across the Jordan-- from the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: 120,000 men equipped with all the military weapons of war.
131Ch 12:38 All these warriors, lined up in battle formation, came to Hebron with wholehearted determination to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel was also of one mind to make David king.
131Ch 12:39 They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their relatives had provided for them.
131Ch 12:40 In addition, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen-- abundant provisions of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine and oil, oxen, and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.
131Ch 13:1 David consulted with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
131Ch 13:2 Then he said to the whole assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if this is from the LORD our God, let us spread out and send the message to the rest of our relatives in all the districts of Israel, including the priests and Levites in their cities with pasturelands, that they should gather together with us.
131Ch 13:3 Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him in Saul's days."
131Ch 13:4 Since the proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to do it.
131Ch 13:5 So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
131Ch 13:6 David and all Israel went to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim), which belongs to Judah, to take from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD who dwells [between] the cherubim.
131Ch 13:7 At Abinadab's house, they set the ark of God on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart.
131Ch 13:8 David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before God with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
131Ch 13:9 When they came to Chidon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to hold the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
131Ch 13:10 Then the LORD's anger burned against Uzzah, and He struck him dead because he had reached out to the ark. So he died there in the presence of God.
131Ch 13:11 David was angry because of the LORD's outburst against Uzzah, so he named that place Outburst Against Uzzah, as it is [still named] today.
131Ch 13:12 David feared God that day, and said, "How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?"
131Ch 13:13 So David did not move the ark of God home to the city of David; instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
131Ch 13:14 The ark of God remained with Obed-edom's family in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his family and all that he had.
131Ch 14:1 King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters to build a palace for him.
131Ch 14:2 Then David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been exalted for the sake of His people Israel.
131Ch 14:3 David took more wives in Jerusalem, and he became the father of more sons and daughters.
131Ch 14:4 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
131Ch 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
131Ch 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
131Ch 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
131Ch 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of David; when David heard of this, he went out to face them.
131Ch 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim,
131Ch 14:10 so David inquired of God, "Should I go to war against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?" The LORD replied, "Go, and I will hand them over to you."
131Ch 14:11 So the Israelites went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated the Philistines there. Then David said, "Like a bursting flood, God has used me to burst out against my enemies." Therefore, they named that place the Lord Bursts Out.
131Ch 14:12 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
131Ch 14:13 Once again the Philistines made a raid in the valley.
131Ch 14:14 So David again inquired of God, and God answered him, "Do not pursue them directly. Circle down away from them and attack them opposite the balsam trees.
131Ch 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then march out to battle, for God will have marched out ahead of you to attack the camp of the Philistines."
131Ch 14:16 So David did exactly as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
131Ch 14:17 Then David's fame spread throughout the lands, and the LORD caused all the nations to be terrified of him.
131Ch 15:1 David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
131Ch 15:2 Then David said, "No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever."
131Ch 15:3 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
131Ch 15:4 Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
131Ch 15:5 From the Kohathites, Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives;
131Ch 15:6 from the Merarites, Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives;
131Ch 15:7 from the Gershomites, Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives;
131Ch 15:8 from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives;
131Ch 15:9 from the Hebronites, Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives;
131Ch 15:10 from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.
131Ch 15:11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
131Ch 15:12 He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel to [the place] I have prepared for it.
131Ch 15:13 For the LORD our God burst out [in anger] against us because you Levites were not [with] us the first time, for we didn't inquire of Him about the proper procedures."
131Ch 15:14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
131Ch 15:15 Then the Levites carried the ark of God the way Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD: on their shoulders with the poles.
131Ch 15:16 Then David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers and to have them raise their voices with joy accompanied by musical instruments-- harps, lyres, and cymbals.
131Ch 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah.
131Ch 15:18 With them were their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
131Ch 15:19 The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
131Ch 15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
131Ch 15:21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to the Sheminith.
131Ch 15:22 Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was skillful.
131Ch 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
131Ch 15:24 The priests, Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be gatekeepers for the ark.
131Ch 15:25 David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of the thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom.
131Ch 15:26 And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
131Ch 15:27 Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the music leader of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.
131Ch 15:28 So all Israel was bringing the ark of the covenant of the LORD up with shouts, the sound of the ram's horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and the playing of harps and lyres.
131Ch 15:29 As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the city of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked down from the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
131Ch 16:1 They brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in God's presence.
131Ch 16:2 When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
131Ch 16:3 Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
131Ch 16:4 David appointed some of the Levites to be ministers before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate the LORD God of Israel, and to give thanks and praise to Him.
131Ch 16:5 Asaph was the chief and Zechariah was second to him. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel played the harps and lyres, while Asaph [sounded] the cymbals
131Ch 16:6 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel [blew] the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
131Ch 16:7 On that day David decreed for the first time that thanks be given to the LORD by Asaph and his relatives:
131Ch 16:8 Give thanks to the LORD; call on His name; proclaim His deeds among the peoples.
131Ch 16:9 Sing to Him; sing praise to Him; tell about all His wonderful works!
131Ch 16:10 Honor His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
131Ch 16:11 Search for the LORD and for His strength; seek His face always.
131Ch 16:12 Remember the wonderful works He has done, His wonders, and the judgments He has pronounced,
131Ch 16:13 you offspring of Israel His servant, Jacob's descendants-- His chosen ones.
131Ch 16:14 He is the LORD our God; His judgments [govern] the whole earth.
131Ch 16:15 Remember His covenant forever-- the promise He ordained for a thousand generations,
131Ch 16:16 [the covenant] He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac,
131Ch 16:17 and confirmed to Jacob as a decree, and to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
131Ch 16:18 "I will give the land of Canaan to you as your inherited portion."
131Ch 16:19 When they were few in number, very few indeed, and temporary residents in Canaan
131Ch 16:20 wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another,
131Ch 16:21 He allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
131Ch 16:22 "Do not touch My anointed ones or harm My prophets."
131Ch 16:23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
131Ch 16:24 Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful works among all peoples.
131Ch 16:25 For the LORD is great and is highly praised; He is feared above all gods.
131Ch 16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
131Ch 16:27 Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy are in His place.
131Ch 16:28 Ascribe to the LORD, families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
131Ch 16:29 Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the splendor of [His] holiness;
131Ch 16:30 tremble before Him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.
131Ch 16:31 Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, "The LORD is King!"
131Ch 16:32 Let the sea and everything in it resound; let the fields and all that is in them exult.
131Ch 16:33 Then the trees of the forest will shout for joy before the LORD, for He is coming to judge the earth.
131Ch 16:34 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
131Ch 16:35 And say: "Save us, God of our salvation; gather us and rescue us from the nations so that we may give thanks to Your holy name and rejoice in Your praise.
131Ch 16:36 May the LORD, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting." Then all the people said, " Amen" and "Praise the LORD."
131Ch 16:37 So David left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the LORD's covenant to minister regularly before the ark according to the daily requirements.
131Ch 16:38 [He also left] Obed-edom and his 68 relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.
131Ch 16:39 [David left] Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon
131Ch 16:40 to offer burnt offerings regularly, morning and evening, to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings and to do everything that was written in the law of the LORD, which He had commanded Israel to keep.
131Ch 16:41 With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD-- for His faithful love endures forever.
131Ch 16:42 Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals to play and musical instruments of God. Jeduthun's sons were at the gate.
131Ch 16:43 Then all the people left for their homes, and David returned [home] to bless his household.
131Ch 17:1 When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Look! I am living in a cedar house while the ark of the LORD's covenant is under tent curtains."
131Ch 17:2 So Nathan told David, "Do all that is on your heart, for God is with you."
131Ch 17:3 But that night the word of God came to Nathan:
131Ch 17:4 "Go to David My servant and say, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house to dwell in.
131Ch 17:5 From the time I brought Israel out of [Egypt] until today I have not lived in a house; instead, I have moved from tent to tent and from tabernacle [to tabernacle].
131Ch 17:6 In all My travels throughout Israel, have I ever spoken a word to even one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, asking: Why haven't you built Me a house of cedar?'
131Ch 17:7 "Now this is what you will say to My servant David: 'This is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture and from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel.
131Ch 17:8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a name for you like that of the greatest in the land.
131Ch 17:9 I will establish a place for My people Israel and plant them, so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they formerly have
131Ch 17:10 ever since the day I ordered judges to be over My people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. " 'Furthermore, I declare to you that the LORD Himself will build a house for you.
131Ch 17:11 When your time comes to be with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who is one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
131Ch 17:12 He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.
131Ch 17:13 I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. I will not take away My faithful love from him as I took it from the one who was before you.
131Ch 17:14 I will appoint him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.'"
131Ch 17:15 Nathan recounted all these words and this entire vision to David.
131Ch 17:16 Then King David went in, sat in the LORD's presence, and said, "Who am I, LORD God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?
131Ch 17:17 This was a little thing to You, God, for You have spoken about Your servant's house in the distant future. You regard me as a man of distinction, LORD God.
131Ch 17:18 What more can David say to You for honoring Your servant? You know Your servant.
131Ch 17:19 LORD, You have done all this greatness, making known all these great [promises] because of Your servant and according to Your will.
131Ch 17:20 LORD, there is no one like You, and there is no God besides You, as all we have heard confirms.
131Ch 17:21 And who is like Your people Israel? God, You came to one nation on earth to redeem a people for Yourself, to make a name for Yourself through great and awesome deeds by driving out nations before Your people You redeemed from Egypt.
131Ch 17:22 You made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, LORD, have become their God.
131Ch 17:23 "Now, LORD, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be confirmed forever, and do as You have promised.
131Ch 17:24 Let your name be confirmed and magnified forever in the saying, 'The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.' May the house of Your servant David be established before You.
131Ch 17:25 Since You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house, Your servant has found [courage] to pray in Your presence.
131Ch 17:26 LORD, You indeed are God, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
131Ch 17:27 So now, You have been pleased to bless Your servant's house that it may continue before You forever. For You, LORD, have blessed it, and it is blessed forever."
131Ch 18:1 After this, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from Philistine control.
131Ch 18:2 He also defeated the Moabites, and they became David's subjects and brought tribute.
131Ch 18:3 David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah at Hamath when he went to establish his control at the Euphrates River.
131Ch 18:4 David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers from him and hamstrung all the horses, and he kept 100 chariots.
131Ch 18:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to assist King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Aramean men.
131Ch 18:6 Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became David's subjects and brought tribute. The LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
131Ch 18:7 David took the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
131Ch 18:8 From Tibhath and Cun, Hadadezer's cities, David also took huge quantities of bronze, from which Solomon made the bronze reservoir, the pillars, and the bronze articles.
131Ch 18:9 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah,
131Ch 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou and Hadadezer had fought many wars. [Hadoram brought] all kinds of items of gold, silver, and bronze.
131Ch 18:11 King David also dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all the nations-- from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites.
131Ch 18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
131Ch 18:13 He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. The LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
131Ch 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people.
131Ch 18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
131Ch 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was court secretary;
131Ch 18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were the chief officials at the king's side.
131Ch 19:1 Some time later, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place.
131Ch 19:2 Then David said, "I'll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. However, when David's emissaries arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,
131Ch 19:3 the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, "Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he's showing respect for your father? Instead, hasn't David sent his emissaries in order to scout out, overthrow, and spy on the land?"
131Ch 19:4 So Hanun took David's emissaries, shaved them, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away.
131Ch 19:5 Someone came and reported to David about his men, so he sent [someone] to meet them, since the men were deeply humiliated. The king said, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return."
131Ch 19:6 When the Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 38 tons of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
131Ch 19:7 They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites also gathered from their cities and came for the battle.
131Ch 19:8 David heard about this and sent Joab and the entire army of warriors.
131Ch 19:9 The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were in the field by themselves.
131Ch 19:10 When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some men out of all the elite troops of Israel and lined up in battle formation to engage the Arameans.
131Ch 19:11 He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, and they lined up in battle formation to engage the Ammonites.
131Ch 19:12 "If the Arameans are too strong for me," Joab said, "then you'll be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll help you.
131Ch 19:13 Be strong! We must prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD's will be done."
131Ch 19:14 Joab and the people with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him.
131Ch 19:15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Joab's brother Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem.
131Ch 19:16 When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring out the Arameans who were across the Euphrates with Shophach, commander of Hadadezer's army, leading them.
131Ch 19:17 When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came up to them and lined up in battle formation against them. When David lined up to engage the Arameans in battle, they fought against him.
131Ch 19:18 But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 7,000 of their charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, commander of the army.
131Ch 19:19 When Hadadezer's subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After this, the Arameans were never willing to help the Ammonites again.
131Ch 20:1 In the spring when kings march out [to war], Joab led the army and destroyed the Ammonites' land. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.
131Ch 20:2 Then David took the crown from the head of their king, and it was [placed] on David's head. He discovered the crown weighed 75 pounds of gold, and there was a precious stone in it. In addition, David took away a large quantity of plunder from the city.
131Ch 20:3 He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then he and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
131Ch 20:4 After this, a war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
131Ch 20:5 Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.
131Ch 20:6 There was still another battle at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary stature with six fingers [on each hand] and six toes [on each foot]-- 24 in all. He, too, was descended from the giant.
131Ch 20:7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David's brother Shimei, killed him.
131Ch 20:8 These were the descendants of the giant in Gath killed by David and his soldiers.
131Ch 21:1 Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count [the people of] Israel.
131Ch 21:2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring [a report] to me so I can know their number."
131Ch 21:3 Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply the number of His people a hundred times over! My lord the king, aren't they all my lord's servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"
131Ch 21:4 Yet the king's order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem.
131Ch 21:5 Joab gave David the total of the registration of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 swordsmen and in Judah itself 470,000 swordsmen.
131Ch 21:6 But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king's command was detestable to him.
131Ch 21:7 This command was also evil in God's sight, so He afflicted Israel.
131Ch 21:8 David said to God, "I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, because I've been very foolish, please take away your servant's guilt."
131Ch 21:9 Then the LORD instructed Gad, David's seer,
131Ch 21:10 "Go and say to David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three [choices]. Choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.'"
131Ch 21:11 So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Take your [choice]--
131Ch 21:12 either three years of famine, three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD-- a plague on the land, the angel of the LORD bringing destruction to the whole territory of Israel.' Now decide what answer I should take back to the One who sent me."
131Ch 21:13 David answered Gad, "I have great anxiety. Please, let me fall into the LORD's hands because His mercies are very great, but don't let me fall into human hands."
131Ch 21:14 So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.
131Ch 21:15 Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city, the LORD looked, relented concerning the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying [the people], "Enough, withdraw your hand now!" The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
131Ch 21:16 When David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell down with their faces [to the ground].
131Ch 21:17 David said to God, "Wasn't I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? My LORD God, please let Your hand be against me and against my father's family, but don't let the plague be against Your people."
131Ch 21:18 So the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
131Ch 21:19 David went up at Gad's command spoken in the name of the LORD.
131Ch 21:20 Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel. His four sons, who were with him, hid themselves.
131Ch 21:21 David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
131Ch 21:22 Then David said to Ornan, "Give me this threshing-floor plot so that I may build an altar to the LORD on it. Give it to me for the full price, so the plague on the people may be halted."
131Ch 21:23 Ornan said to David, "Take it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants. See, I give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering-- I give it all."
131Ch 21:24 King David answered Ornan, "No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you or offer burnt offerings that cost [me] nothing."
131Ch 21:25 So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold for the plot.
131Ch 21:26 He built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
131Ch 21:27 Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
131Ch 21:28 At that time, when David saw that the LORD answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
131Ch 21:29 At that time the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at the high place in Gibeon,
131Ch 21:30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was terrified of the sword of the LORD's angel.
131Ch 22:1 Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel."
131Ch 22:2 So David gave orders to gather the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, and he appointed stonemasons to cut finished stones for building God's house.
131Ch 22:3 David supplied a great deal of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with an immeasurable quantity of bronze,
131Ch 22:4 and innumerable cedar logs, because the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
131Ch 22:5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly great and famous and glorious in all the lands. Therefore, I must make provision for it." So David made lavish preparations for it before his death.
131Ch 22:6 Then he summoned his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
131Ch 22:7 "My son," David said to Solomon, "It was in my heart to build a house for the name of the LORD my God,
131Ch 22:8 but the word of the LORD came to me: 'You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.
131Ch 22:9 But a son will be born to you; he will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies, for his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign.
131Ch 22:10 He is the one who will build a house for My name. He will be My son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
131Ch 22:11 "Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said about you.
131Ch 22:12 Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in charge of Israel so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
131Ch 22:13 Then you will succeed if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don't be afraid or discouraged.
131Ch 22:14 "Notice I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD-- 3,775 tons of gold, 37,750 tons of silver, and bronze and iron that can't be weighed because there is so much of it. I have also provided timber and stone, but you will need to add more to them.
131Ch 22:15 You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work
131Ch 22:16 in gold, silver, bronze, and iron-- beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you."
131Ch 22:17 Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:
131Ch 22:18 "The LORD your God is with you, isn't He? And hasn't He given you rest on every side? For He has handed the land's inhabitants over to me, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people.
131Ch 22:19 Now determine in your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the LORD God's sanctuary so that you may bring the ark of the LORD's covenant and the holy articles of God to the temple that is to be built for the name of the LORD."
131Ch 23:1 When David was old and full of days, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
131Ch 23:2 Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites.
131Ch 23:3 The Levites 30 years old and above were counted; the total number of men was 38,000 by headcount.
131Ch 23:4 "Of these," [David said], "24,000 are to be in charge of the work on the LORD's temple, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,
131Ch 23:5 4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments that I have made for worship."
131Ch 23:6 Then David divided them into divisions according to Levi's sons: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
131Ch 23:7 The Gershomites: Ladan and Shimei.
131Ch 23:8 Ladan's sons: Jehiel was the first, then Zetham, and Joel-- three.
131Ch 23:9 Shimei's sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran-- three. Those were the heads of the families of Ladan.
131Ch 23:10 Shimei's sons: Jahath, Zizah, Jeush, and Beriah. Those were Shimei's sons-- four.
131Ch 23:11 Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; however, Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became an ancestral house [and received] a single assignment.
131Ch 23:12 Kohath's sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel-- four.
131Ch 23:13 Amram's sons: Aaron and Moses. Aaron, along with his descendants, was set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense in the presence of the LORD, to minister to Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.
131Ch 23:14 As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
131Ch 23:15 Moses' sons: Gershom and Eliezer.
131Ch 23:16 Gershom's sons: Shebuel first.
131Ch 23:17 Eliezer's sons were Rehabiah, first; Eliezer did not have any other sons, but Rehabiah's sons were very numerous.
131Ch 23:18 Izhar's sons: Shelomith was first.
131Ch 23:19 Hebron's sons: Jeriah was first, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, and Jekameam fourth.
131Ch 23:20 Uzziel's sons: Micah was first, and Isshiah second.
131Ch 23:21 Merari's sons: Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons: Eleazar and Kish.
131Ch 23:22 Eleazar died having no sons, only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
131Ch 23:23 Mushi's sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth-- three.
131Ch 23:24 These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses-- the heads of families, according to their registration by name in the headcount-- 20 years old or more, who worked in the service of the LORD's temple.
131Ch 23:25 For David said, "The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He has come to stay in Jerusalem forever.
131Ch 23:26 Also, the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the equipment for its service"--
131Ch 23:27 for according to the last words of David, the Levites 20 years old or more were to be counted--
131Ch 23:28 "but their duty will be to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the LORD's temple, being responsible for the courts and the chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of God's temple--
131Ch 23:29 as well as the rows [of the bread of the Presence], the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of volume and length.
131Ch 23:30 They are also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.
131Ch 23:31 Whenever burnt offerings are offered to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed festivals, they are to do so regularly in the LORD's presence according to the number prescribed for them.
131Ch 23:32 They are to carry out their responsibilities to the tent of meeting, to the holy place, and to their relatives, the sons of Aaron, in the service of the LORD's temple."
131Ch 24:1 The divisions of the descendants of Aaron were as follows: Aaron's sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
131Ch 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
131Ch 24:3 Together with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar, David divided them according to the assigned duties of their service.
131Ch 24:4 Since more leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than Ithamar's, they were divided [accordingly]: 16 heads of ancestral houses were from Eleazar's descendants, and eight [heads] of ancestral houses were from Ithamar's.
131Ch 24:5 They were divided impartially by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar's and Ithamar's descendants.
131Ch 24:6 The secretary, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the officers, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites. One ancestral house was taken for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar.
131Ch 24:7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
131Ch 24:8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
131Ch 24:9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
131Ch 24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
131Ch 24:11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
131Ch 24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
131Ch 24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
131Ch 24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
131Ch 24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
131Ch 24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
131Ch 24:17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
131Ch 24:18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
131Ch 24:19 These had their assigned duties for service when they entered the LORD's temple, according to their regulations, which they received from their ancestor Aaron, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
131Ch 24:20 As for the rest of Levi's sons: from Amram's sons: Shubael; from Shubael's sons: Jehdeiah.
131Ch 24:21 From Rehabiah: from Rehabiah's sons: Isshiah was the first.
131Ch 24:22 From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from Shelomoth's sons: Jahath.
131Ch 24:23 Hebron's sons: Jeriah [the first], Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
131Ch 24:24 [From] Uzziel's sons: Micah; from Micah's sons: Shamir.
131Ch 24:25 Micah's brother: Isshiah; from Isshiah's sons: Zechariah.
131Ch 24:26 Merari's sons: Mahli and Mushi, [and from] his sons, Jaaziah his son.
131Ch 24:27 Merari's sons, by his son Jaaziah: Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
131Ch 24:28 From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.

131Ch 27:24 Joab son of Zeruiah began to count them, but he didn't complete it. There was wrath against Israel because of this [census], and the number was not entered in the Historical Record of King David.

131Ch 28:2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the LORD's covenant and as a footstool for our God. I had made preparations to build,
131Ch 28:3 but God said to me, 'You are not to build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.'
131Ch 28:4 "Yet the LORD God of Israel chose me out of all my father's household to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah, my father's household, and from my father's sons, He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
131Ch 28:5 And out of all my sons-- for the LORD has given me many sons-- He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the LORD's kingdom over Israel.
131Ch 28:6 He said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who is to build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his father.
131Ch 28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he perseveres in keeping My commandments and My ordinances as [he is] today.'
131Ch 28:8 "So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek after all the commandments of the LORD your God so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
131Ch 28:9 "As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.
131Ch 28:10 Realize now that the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it."
131Ch 28:11 Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the vestibule [of the temple] and its buildings, treasuries, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the place of atonement.
131Ch 28:12 The plans contained everything he had in mind for the courts of the LORD's house, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of God's house, and the treasuries for what is dedicated.
131Ch 28:13 [Also included were plans] for the divisions of the priests and the Levites; all the work of service in the LORD's house; all the articles of service of the LORD's house;
131Ch 28:14 the weight of gold for all the articles for every kind of service; the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service;
131Ch 28:15 the weight of the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand;
131Ch 28:16 the weight of gold for each table for the rows [of the bread of the Presence] and the silver for the silver tables;
131Ch 28:17 the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling basins, and pitchers; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl;
131Ch 28:18 the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense; and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim that spread out [their wings] and cover the ark of the LORD's covenant.
131Ch 28:19 [David concluded,] "By the LORD's hand on me, He enabled me to understand everything in writing, all the details of the plan."
131Ch 28:20 Then David said to his son Solomon, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Don't be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won't leave you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the LORD's house is finished.
131Ch 28:21 Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God's house. Every willing man of any skill will be at your disposal for the work, and the leaders and all the people are at your every command."
131Ch 29:1 Then King David said to all the assembly, "My son Solomon-- God has chosen him alone-- is young and inexperienced. The task is great, for the temple will not be for man, but for the LORD God.
131Ch 29:2 So to the best of my ability I've made provision for the house of my God: gold for the gold [articles], silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx, [stones for] mounting, antimony, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and a great quantity of marble.
131Ch 29:3 Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the house of my God over and above all that I've provided for the holy house:
131Ch 29:4 100 tons of gold (gold of Ophir) and 250 tons of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings,
131Ch 29:5 the gold for the gold [work] and the silver for the silver, for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the LORD today?"
131Ch 29:6 Then the leaders of the households, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.
131Ch 29:7 For the service of God's house they gave 185 tons of gold and 10,000 gold drachmas, 375 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 4,000 tons of iron.
131Ch 29:8 Whoever had [precious] stones gave them to the treasury of the LORD's house under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
131Ch 29:9 Then the people rejoiced because of their leaders' willingness to give, for they had given to the LORD with a whole heart. King David also rejoiced greatly.
131Ch 29:10 Then David praised the LORD in the sight of all the assembly. David said, "May You be praised, LORD God of our father Israel, from eternity to eternity.
131Ch 29:11 Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to You. Yours, LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all.
131Ch 29:12 Riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler of everything. In Your hand are power and might, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
131Ch 29:13 Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks and praise Your glorious name.
131Ch 29:14 "But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your own hand.
131Ch 29:15 For we are foreigners and sojourners in Your presence as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
131Ch 29:16 LORD our God, all this wealth that we've provided for building You a house for Your holy name comes from Your hand; everything belongs to You.
131Ch 29:17 I know, my God, that You test the heart and that You are pleased with uprightness. I have willingly given all these things with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.
131Ch 29:18 LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the hearts of Your people, and confirm their hearts toward You.
131Ch 29:19 Give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and to carry out all Your commandments, Your decrees, and Your statutes, and to build the temple for which I have made provision."
131Ch 29:20 Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So the whole assembly praised the LORD God of their ancestors. They bowed down and paid homage to the LORD and the king.
131Ch 29:21 The following day they offered sacrifices to the LORD and burnt offerings to the LORD: 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, along with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
131Ch 29:22 They ate and drank with great joy in the LORD's presence that day. Then, for a second time, they made David's son Solomon king; they anointed him as the LORD's ruler, and Zadok as the priest.
131Ch 29:23 Solomon sat on the LORD's throne as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
131Ch 29:24 All the leaders and the mighty men, and all of King David's sons as well, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
131Ch 29:25 The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been [bestowed] on any king over Israel before him.
131Ch 29:26 David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
131Ch 29:27 The length of his reign over Israel was 40 years; he reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for 33.
131Ch 29:28 He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon became king in his place.
131Ch 29:29 As for the events of King David's [reign], from beginning to end, note that they are written about in the Events of Samuel the Seer, the Events of Nathan the Prophet, and the Events of Gad the Seer,
131Ch 29:30 along with all his reign, his might, and the incidents that affected him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the [surrounding] lands.
14
142Ch 1:1 Solomon son of David strengthened his hold on his kingdom. The LORD his God was with him and highly exalted him.
142Ch 1:2 Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel-- the heads of the families.
142Ch 1:3 Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was in Gibeon because God's tent of meeting, which the LORD's servant Moses had made in the wilderness, was there.
142Ch 1:4 Now, David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had set up for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem,
142Ch 1:5 but he put the bronze altar, which Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, in front of the LORD's tabernacle. Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him [there].
142Ch 1:6 Solomon offered sacrifices there in the LORD's presence on the bronze altar at the tent of meeting; he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.
142Ch 1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him: "Ask. What should I give you?"
142Ch 1:8 And Solomon said to God: "You have shown great faithful love to my father David, and You have made me king in his place.
142Ch 1:9 LORD God, let Your promise to my father David now come true. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
142Ch 1:10 Now, grant me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people, for who can judge this great people of Yours?"
142Ch 1:11 God said to Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not requested riches, wealth, or glory, or for the life of those who hate you, and you have not even requested long life, but you have requested for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king,
142Ch 1:12 wisdom and knowledge are given to you. I will also give you riches, wealth, and glory, such that it was not like this for the kings who were before you, nor will it be like this for those after you."
142Ch 1:13 So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place that was in Gibeon in front of the tent of meeting, and he reigned over Israel.
142Ch 1:14 Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
142Ch 1:15 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills.
142Ch 1:16 Solomon's horses came from Egypt and Kue. The king's traders would get them from Kue at the going price.
142Ch 1:17 A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 15 pounds [of silver] and a horse for about four pounds. In the same way, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram through their agents.
142Ch 2:1  Solomon decided to build a temple for the name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself,
142Ch 2:2  so he assigned 70,000 men as porters, 80,000 men as stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 as supervisors over them.
142Ch 2:3 Then Solomon sent [word] to King Hiram of Tyre: [Do for me] what you did for my father David. You sent him cedars to build him a house to live in.
142Ch 2:4 Now I myself am building a temple for the name of the LORD my God in order to dedicate it to Him for burning sweet incense before Him, for [displaying] the rows [of the bread of the Presence] continuously, and for [sacrificing] burnt offerings for the evening and the morning, the Sabbaths and the New Moons, and the appointed festivals of the LORD our God. This is [ordained] for Israel forever.
142Ch 2:5 The temple that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than any of the gods.
142Ch 2:6 But who is able to build a temple for Him, since even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain Him? Who am I then that I should build a house for Him except as a place to burn incense before Him?
142Ch 2:7 Therefore, send me a craftsman who is skilled in engraving to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. [He will work] with the craftsmen who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, appointed by my father David.
142Ch 2:8 Also, send me cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut the trees of Lebanon. Note that my servants will be with your servants
142Ch 2:9 to prepare logs for me in abundance because the temple I am building will be great and wonderful.
142Ch 2:10 I will give your servants, the woodcutters who cut the trees, 100,000 bushels of wheat flour, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of oil.
142Ch 2:11 Then King Hiram of Tyre wrote a letter and sent [it] to Solomon: Because the LORD loves His people, He set you over them as king.
142Ch 2:12 Hiram also said: May the LORD God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, be praised! He gave King David a wise son with insight and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
142Ch 2:13 I have now sent Huram-abi, a skillful man who has understanding.
142Ch 2:14 He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan. His father is a man of Tyre. He knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, with purple, blue, crimson yarn, and fine linen. He knows how to do all kinds of engraving and to execute any design that may be given him. I have sent him to be with your craftsmen and the craftsmen of my lord, your father David.
142Ch 2:15 Now, let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine to his servants as promised.
142Ch 2:16 We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need, and bring them to you as rafts by sea to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.
142Ch 2:17 Solomon took a census of all the foreign men in the land of Israel, after the census that his father David had conducted, and the total was 153,600.
142Ch 2:18 Solomon made 70,000 of them porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work.
142Ch 3:1 Then Solomon began to build the LORD's temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the site David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
142Ch 3:2 He began to build on the second [day] of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
142Ch 3:3 These are Solomon's foundations for building God's temple: the length was 90 feet, and the width 30 feet.
142Ch 3:4 The portico, which was across the front extending across the width of the temple, was 30 feet wide; its height was 30 feet; he overlaid its inner surface with pure gold.
142Ch 3:5 The larger room he paneled with cypress wood, overlaid with fine gold, and decorated with palm trees and chains.
142Ch 3:6 He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim.
142Ch 3:7 He overlaid the temple-- the beams, the thresholds, its walls and doors-- with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
142Ch 3:8 Then he made the most holy place; its length corresponded to the width of the temple, 30 feet, and its width was 30 feet. He overlaid it with 45,000 pounds of fine gold.
142Ch 3:9 The weight of the nails was 20 ounces of gold, and he overlaid the ceiling with gold.
142Ch 3:10 He made two cherubim of sculptured work, for the most holy place, and he overlaid them with gold.
142Ch 3:11 The overall length of the wings of the cherubim was 30 feet: the wing of one was seven and a half feet, touching the wall of the room; its other wing was seven and a half feet, touching the wing of the other cherub.
142Ch 3:12 The wing of the other cherub was seven and a half feet, touching the wall of the room; its other wing was seven and a half feet, reaching the wing of the other cherub.
142Ch 3:13 The wingspan of these cherubim was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced the larger room.
142Ch 3:14 He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, and he wove cherubim into it.
142Ch 3:15 In front of the temple he made two pillars, [each] 27 feethigh. The capital on top of each was seven and half feet high.
142Ch 3:16 He had made chainwork in the inner sanctuary and also put it on top of the pillars. He made 100 pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork.
142Ch 3:17 Then he set up the pillars in front of the sanctuary, one on the right and one on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.
142Ch 4:1 He made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high.
142Ch 4:2 Then he made the cast [metal] reservoir, 15 feet from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was seven and a half feet high, and 45 feet in circumference.
142Ch 4:3 The likeness of oxen was below it, completely encircling it, 10 every half yard, completely surrounding the reservoir. The oxen were cast in two rows when the reservoir was cast.
142Ch 4:4 It stood on 12 oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The reservoir was on top of them and all their hindquarters were toward the center.
142Ch 4:5 The reservoir was three inches thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup or a lily blossom. It could hold 11,000 gallons.
142Ch 4:6 He made 10 basins for washing and he put five on the right and five on the left. The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them, but the reservoir was used by the priests for washing.
142Ch 4:7 He made the 10 gold lampstands according to their specifications and put them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left.
142Ch 4:8 He made 10 tables and placed them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left. He also made 100 gold bowls.
142Ch 4:9 He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court, and doors for the court. He overlaid the doors with bronze.
142Ch 4:10 He put the reservoir on the right side, toward the southeast.
142Ch 4:11 Then Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was doing for King Solomon in God's temple:
142Ch 4:12 two pillars; the bowls and the capitals on top of the two pillars; the two gratings for covering both bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars;
142Ch 4:13 the 400 pomegranates for the two gratings (two rows of pomegranates for each grating covering both capitals' bowls on top of the pillars).
142Ch 4:14 He also made the water carts and the basins on the water carts.
142Ch 4:15 The one reservoir and the 12 oxen underneath it,
142Ch 4:16 the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all their utensils-- Huram-abi made them for King Solomon for the LORD's temple. [All these were made] of polished bronze.
142Ch 4:17 The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah.
142Ch 4:18 Solomon made all these utensils in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
142Ch 4:19 Solomon also made all the equipment in God's temple: the gold altar; the tables on which [to put] the bread of the Presence;
142Ch 4:20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn in front of the inner sanctuary according to specifications;
142Ch 4:21 the flowers, lamps, and gold tongs-- of purest gold;
142Ch 4:22 the wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles, and firepans-- of purest gold; and the entryway to the temple, its inner doors to the most holy place, and the doors of the temple sanctuary-- of gold.
142Ch 5:1 So all the work Solomon did for the LORD's temple was completed. Then Solomon brought the consecrated things of his father David-- the silver, the gold, and all the utensils-- and put them in the treasuries of God's temple.
142Ch 5:2 At that time Solomon assembled at Jerusalem the elders of Israel-- all the tribal heads, the ancestral chiefs of the Israelites-- in order to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD up from the city of David, that is, Zion.
142Ch 5:3 So all the men of Israel were assembled in the king's presence at the festival; this was in the seventh month.
142Ch 5:4 All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites picked up the ark.
142Ch 5:5 They brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up.
142Ch 5:6 King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who had gathered around him were in front of the ark sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered because there were so many.
142Ch 5:7 The priests brought the ark of the LORD's covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the most holy place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
142Ch 5:8 And the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark so that the cherubim formed a cover above the ark and its poles.
142Ch 5:9 The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen from outside; they are there to this very day.
142Ch 5:10 Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had put [in it] at Horeb,where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of Egypt.
142Ch 5:11 When the priests came out of the holy place-- for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their tour of duty--
142Ch 5:12 the Levitical singers of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, and of their sons and their relatives, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps and lyres, were standing east of the altar, and with them were 120 priests blowing trumpets.
142Ch 5:13 The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice. They raised [their] voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD: For He is good; His faithful love endures forever; the temple, the LORD's temple, was filled with a cloud.
142Ch 5:14 And because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the LORD filled God's temple.
142Ch 6:1 Then Solomon said: The LORD said He would dwell in thick darkness,
142Ch 6:2 but I have built an exalted temple for You, a place for Your residence forever.
142Ch 6:3 Then the king turned and blessed the entire congregation of Israel while they were standing.
142Ch 6:4 He said: May the LORD God of Israel be praised! He spoke directly to my father David, and He has fulfilled [the promise] by His power. He said,
142Ch 6:5 "Since the day I brought My people Israel out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city to build a temple in among any of the tribes of Israel, so that My name would be there, and I have not chosen a man to be ruler over My people Israel.
142Ch 6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem so that My name will be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel."
142Ch 6:7 Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
142Ch 6:8 However, the LORD said to my father David, "Since it was your desire to build a temple for My name, you have done well to have this desire.
142Ch 6:9 Yet, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own offspring, will build the temple for My name."
142Ch 6:10 So the LORD has fulfilled what He promised. I have taken the place of my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the temple for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
142Ch 6:11 I have put the ark there, where the LORD's covenant is that He made with the Israelites.
142Ch 6:12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire congregation of Israel and spread out his hands.
142Ch 6:13 For Solomon had made a bronze platform seven and a half feet long, seven and a half feet wide, and four and a half feet high and put it in the court. He stood on it, knelt down in front of the entire congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven.
142Ch 6:14 He said: LORD God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, keeping His gracious covenant with Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.
142Ch 6:15 You have kept what You promised to Your servant, my father David. You spoke directly [to him], and You fulfilled [Your promise] by Your power, as it is today.
142Ch 6:16 Therefore, LORD God of Israel, keep what You promised to Your servant, my father David: You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons guard their way to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.
142Ch 6:17 Now, LORD God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant David.
142Ch 6:18 But will God indeed live on earth with man? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built.
142Ch 6:19 Listen to Your servant's prayer and his petition, LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant prays before You,
142Ch 6:20 so that Your eyes watch over this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your name; and so that You may hear the prayer Your servant prays toward this place.
142Ch 6:21 Hear the petitions of Your servant and Your people Israel, which they pray toward this place. May You hear in Your dwelling place in heaven. May You hear and forgive.
142Ch 6:22 If a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
142Ch 6:23 may You hear in heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing what he has done on his own head and providing justice for the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
142Ch 6:24 If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, and they return [to You] and praise Your name, and they pray and plead for mercy before You in this temple,
142Ch 6:25 may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave them and their ancestors.
142Ch 6:26 When the skies are shut and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and praise Your name, and they turn from their sins because You are afflicting them,
142Ch 6:27 may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way they should walk in. May You send rain on Your land that You gave Your people for an inheritance.
142Ch 6:28 When there is famine on the earth, when there is pestilence, when there is blight, mildew, locust, or grasshopper, when their enemies besiege them in the region of their fortified cities, [when there is] any plague or illness,
142Ch 6:29 whatever prayer or petition anyone from your people Israel might have-- each man knowing his own affliction and suffering, and spreading out his hands toward this temple--
142Ch 6:30 may You hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, and may You forgive and repay the man according to all his ways, since You know his heart, for You alone know the human heart,
142Ch 6:31 so that they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days they live on the land You gave our ancestors.
142Ch 6:32 Even for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm: when he comes and prays toward this temple,
142Ch 6:33 may You hear in heaven in Your dwelling place, and do all the foreigner asks You for. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name, to fear You as Your people Israel do and know that this temple I have built is called by Your name.
142Ch 6:34 When Your people go out to fight against their enemies, wherever You send them, and they pray to You in the direction of this city You have chosen and the temple that I have built for Your name,
142Ch 6:35 may You hear their prayer and petition in heaven and uphold their cause.
142Ch 6:36 When they sin against You-- for there is no one who does not sin-- and You are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, and their captors deport them to a distant or nearby country,
142Ch 6:37 and when they come to their senses in the land where they were deported and repent and petition You in their captors' land, saying: "We have sinned and done wrong; we have been wicked,"
142Ch 6:38 and when they return to You with their whole mind and heart in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive, and when they pray in the direction of their land that You gave their ancestors, and the city You have chosen, and toward the temple I have built for Your name,
142Ch 6:39 may You hear in heaven, in Your dwelling place, their prayer and petitions and uphold their cause. May You forgive Your people who sinned against You.
142Ch 6:40 Now, my God, please let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
142Ch 6:41 Now therefore: Arise, LORD God, [come] to Your resting place, You and the ark [that shows] Your strength. May Your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and may Your godly people rejoice in goodness.
142Ch 6:42 LORD God, do not reject Your anointed one; remember the loyalty of Your servant David.
142Ch 7:1 When Solomon finished praying, fire descended from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
142Ch 7:2 The priests were not able to enter the LORD's temple because the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 7:3 All the Israelites were watching when the fire descended and the glory of the LORD came on the temple. They bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement. They worshiped and praised the LORD: For He is good, for His faithful love endures forever.
142Ch 7:4 The king and all the people were offering sacrifices in the LORD's presence.
142Ch 7:5 King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. In this manner the king and all the people dedicated God's temple.
142Ch 7:6 The priests were standing at their stations, as were the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made to praise the LORD-- "for His faithful love endures forever"-- when David offered praise with them. Across from them, the priests were blowing trumpets, and all the people were standing.
142Ch 7:7 Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORD's temple because that was where he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings since the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not accommodate the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat [of the fellowship offerings].
142Ch 7:8 So Solomon and all Israel with him-- a very great assembly, from the entrance to Hamath to the Brook of Egypt-- observed the festival at that time for seven days.
142Ch 7:9 On the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for the dedication of the altar lasted seven days and the festival seven days.
142Ch 7:10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, rejoicing and with happy hearts for the goodness the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel.
142Ch 7:11 So Solomon finished the LORD's temple and the royal palace. Everything that had entered Solomon's heart to do for the LORD's temple and for his own palace succeeded.
142Ch 7:12 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him: I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a temple of sacrifice.
142Ch 7:13 If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the grasshopper to consume the land, or if I send pestilence on My people,
142Ch 7:14 and My people who are called by My name humble themselves, pray and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
142Ch 7:15 My eyes will now be open and My ears attentive to prayer from this place.
142Ch 7:16 And I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that My name may be there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there at all times.
142Ch 7:17 As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing everything I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
142Ch 7:18 I will establish your royal throne, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
142Ch 7:19 However, if you turn away and abandon My statutes and My commands that I have set before you and if you go and serve other gods and worship them,
142Ch 7:20 then I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for My name I will banish from My presence; I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.
142Ch 7:21 As for this temple, which was exalted, every passerby will be appalled and will say: Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?
142Ch 7:22 Then they will say: Because they abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They clung to other gods and worshiped and served them. Because of this, He brought all this ruin on them.
142Ch 8:1 At the end of 20 years during which Solomon had built the LORD's temple and his own palace--
142Ch 8:2 Solomon having rebuilt the cities Hiram gave him and having settled the Israelites there--
142Ch 8:3 Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and seized it.
142Ch 8:4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness along with all the storage cities that he built in Hamath.
142Ch 8:5 He built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon-- fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars--
142Ch 8:6 Baalath, all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon, all the chariot cities, the cavalry cities, and everything Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or anywhere else in the land of his dominion.
142Ch 8:7 As for all the peoples who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not from Israel--
142Ch 8:8 their descendants who remained in the land after them, those whom the Israelites had not completely destroyed-- Solomon imposed forced labor on them; [it is this way] today.
142Ch 8:9 But Solomon did not consign the Israelites to be slaves for his work; they were soldiers, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and his cavalry.
142Ch 8:10 These were King Solomon's deputies: 250 who ruled over the people.
142Ch 8:11 Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel because the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy."
142Ch 8:12 At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the LORD's altar he had made in front of the vestibule
142Ch 8:13 following the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed festivals: the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths.
142Ch 8:14 According to the ordinances of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, of the Levites over their responsibilities to offer praise and to minister before the priests following the daily requirement, and of the gatekeepers by their divisions with respect to each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God.
142Ch 8:15 They did not turn aside from the king's command regarding the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
142Ch 8:16 All of Solomon's work was carried out from the day the foundation [was laid] for the LORD's temple until it was finished. So the LORD's temple was completed.
142Ch 8:17 At that time Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom.
142Ch 8:18 So through his servants, Hiram sent him ships with crews of experienced seamen. They went with Solomon's servants to Ophir, took from there 17 tons of gold, and delivered it to King Solomon.
142Ch 9:1 The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, so she came to test Solomon with difficult questions at Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. She came to Solomon and spoke with him about everything that was on her mind.
142Ch 9:2 So Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for Solomon to explain to her.
142Ch 9:3 When the queen of Sheba observed Solomon's wisdom, the palace he had built,
142Ch 9:4 the food at his table, his servants' residence, his attendants' service and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and the burnt offerings he offered at the LORD's temple, it took her breath away.
142Ch 9:5 She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true.
142Ch 9:6 But I didn't believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, I was not even told half of your great wisdom! You far exceed the report I heard.
142Ch 9:7 How happy are your men. How happy are these servants of yours, who always stand in your presence hearing your wisdom.
142Ch 9:8 May the LORD your God be praised! He delighted in you and put you on his throne as king for the LORD your God. Because Your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has set you over them as king to carry out justice and righteousness."
142Ch 9:9 Then she gave the king four and a half tons of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There never were such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
142Ch 9:10 In addition, Hiram's servants and Solomon's servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum wood and precious stones.
142Ch 9:11 The king made the algum wood into walkways for the LORD's temple and for the king's palace and into harps and lyres for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.
142Ch 9:12 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire, whatever she asked-- far more than she had brought the king. Then she, along with her servants, returned to her own country.
142Ch 9:13 The weight of gold that came to Solomon annually was 25 tons,
142Ch 9:14 besides what was brought by the merchants and traders. All the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
142Ch 9:15 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 15 pounds of hammered gold went into each shield.
142Ch 9:16 He made 300 small shields of hammered gold; about eight pounds of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
142Ch 9:17 The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
142Ch 9:18 The throne had six steps; there was a footstool covered in gold for the throne, armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.
142Ch 9:19 Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom.
142Ch 9:20 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, since it was considered as nothing in Solomon's time,
142Ch 9:21 for the king's ships kept going to Tarshish with Hiram's servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
142Ch 9:22 King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the world in riches and wisdom.
142Ch 9:23 All the kings of the world wanted an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
142Ch 9:24 Each of them would bring his own gift-- items of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, and horses and mules-- as an annual tribute.
142Ch 9:25 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
142Ch 9:26 He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt.
142Ch 9:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills.
142Ch 9:28 They were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all the countries.
142Ch 9:29 The remaining events of Solomon's [reign], from beginning to end, are written about in the Events of Nathan the Prophet, the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat.
142Ch 9:30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years.
142Ch 9:31 Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam became king in his place.
142Ch 10:1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.
142Ch 10:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard [about it]-- for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon's presence-- Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
142Ch 10:3 So they summoned him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam:
142Ch 10:4 "Your father made our yoke harsh. Therefore, lighten your father's harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
142Ch 10:5 Rehoboam replied, "Return to me in three days." So the people left.
142Ch 10:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, "How do you advise me to respond to this people?"
142Ch 10:7 They replied, "If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever."
142Ch 10:8 But he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, the ones serving him.
142Ch 10:9 He asked them, "What message do you advise we send back to this people who said to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
142Ch 10:10 Then the young men who had grown up with him told him, "This is what you should say to the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!' This is what you should say to them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
142Ch 10:11 Now therefore, my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.'"
142Ch 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered, saying, "Return to me on the third day."
142Ch 10:13 Then the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the elders' advice
142Ch 10:14 and spoke to them according to the young men's advice, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips."
142Ch 10:15 The king did not listen to the people because the turn of events came from God, in order that the LORD might carry out His word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
142Ch 10:16 When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king: What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Israel, each man to your tent; David, look after your own house now! So all Israel went to their tents.
142Ch 10:17 But as for the Israelites living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
142Ch 10:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. However, King Rehoboam managed to get up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
142Ch 10:19 Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today.
142Ch 11:1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin-- 180,000 choice warriors-- to fight against Israel to restore the reign to Rehoboam.
142Ch 11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, the man of God:
142Ch 11:3 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people:
142Ch 11:4 'This is what the LORD says: You are not to march up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return home, for this incident has come from Me.' " So they listened to what the LORD said and turned back from going against Jeroboam.
142Ch 11:5 Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem, and he fortified cities in Judah.
142Ch 11:6 He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
142Ch 11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
142Ch 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
142Ch 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
142Ch 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin.
142Ch 11:11 He strengthened their fortifications and put leaders in them with supplies of food, oil, and wine.
142Ch 11:12 He also put large shields and spears in each and every city to make them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
142Ch 11:13 The priests and Levites from all their regions throughout Israel took their stand with Rehoboam,
142Ch 11:14 for the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests of the LORD.
142Ch 11:15 Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places, the goat-demons, and the [gold] calves he had made.
142Ch 11:16 Those from every tribe of Israel who had determined in their hearts to seek the LORD their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their ancestors.
142Ch 11:17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
142Ch 11:18 Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail daughter of Jesse's son Eliab.
142Ch 11:19 She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
142Ch 11:20 After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom. She bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
142Ch 11:21 Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. He acquired 18 wives and 60 concubines and was the father of 28 sons and 60 daughters.
142Ch 11:22 Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief, leader among his brothers, intending to make him king.
142Ch 11:23 Rehoboam also showed discernment by dispersing some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin and to all the fortified cities. He gave them plenty of provisions and sought many wives for them.
142Ch 12:1 When Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he abandoned the law of the LORD-- he and all Israel with him.
142Ch 12:2 Because they were unfaithful to the LORD, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem
142Ch 12:3 with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 cavalrymen, and countless people who came with him from Egypt-- Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
142Ch 12:4 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
142Ch 12:5 Then Shemaiah the prophet went to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them: "This is what the LORD says: 'You have abandoned Me; therefore, I have abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.'"
142Ch 12:6 So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is righteous."
142Ch 12:7 When the LORD saw that they had humbled themselves, the LORD's message came to Shemaiah: "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them but will grant them a little deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
142Ch 12:8 However, they will become his servants so that they may recognize [the difference between] serving Me and serving the kingdoms of the land."
142Ch 12:9 So King Shishak of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem. He seized the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the treasuries of the royal palace. He took everything. He took the gold shields that Solomon had made.
142Ch 12:10 King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them into the care of the captains of the royal escorts who guarded the entrance to the king's palace.
142Ch 12:11 Whenever the king entered the LORD's temple, the royal escorts would carry the shields and take them back to the royal escorts' armory.
142Ch 12:12 When Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD's anger turned away from him, and He did not destroy [him] completely. Besides that, conditions were good in Judah.
142Ch 12:13 King Rehoboam established his royal power in Jerusalem. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king; he reigned 17 years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name. Rehoboam's mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
142Ch 12:14 Rehoboam did what was evil, because he did not determine in his heart to seek the LORD.
142Ch 12:15 The events of Rehoboam's [reign], from beginning to end, are written about in the Events of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer concerning genealogies. There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns.
142Ch 12:16 Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Abijah became king in his place.
142Ch 13:1 In the eighteenth year of [Israel's] King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah;
142Ch 13:2 he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; [she was] from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
142Ch 13:3 Abijah set his army of warriors in order with 400,000 choice men. Jeroboam arranged his mighty army of 800,000 choice men in battle formation against him.
142Ch 13:4 Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, hear me.
142Ch 13:5 Don't you know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
142Ch 13:6 But Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.
142Ch 13:7 Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young, inexperienced, and unable to assert himself against them.
142Ch 13:8 "And now you are saying you can assert yourselves against the LORD's kingdom in the hand of [one of] David's sons. You are a vast multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
142Ch 13:9 Didn't you banish the priests of the LORD, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites, and make your own priests like the peoples of [other] lands do? Whoever comes to ordain himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.
142Ch 13:10 "But as for us, the LORD is our God. We have not abandoned Him; the priests ministering to the LORD are descendants of Aaron, and the Levites [serve] at their tasks.
142Ch 13:11 They offer a burnt offering and fragrant incense to the LORD every morning and every evening, and [they set] the rows of the bread [of the Presence] on the ceremonially clean table. They light the lamps of the gold lampstand every evening. We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God, while you have abandoned Him.
142Ch 13:12 Look, God and His priests are with us at our head. The trumpets are ready to sound the charge against you. Israelites, don't fight against the LORD God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed."
142Ch 13:13 Now Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to advance from behind them. So they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
142Ch 13:14 Judah turned and discovered that the battle was in front of them and behind them, so they cried out to the LORD. Then the priests blew the trumpets,
142Ch 13:15 and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. When the men of Judah raised the battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
142Ch 13:16 So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God handed them over to them.
142Ch 13:17 Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow, and 500,000 choice men of Israel were killed.
142Ch 13:18 The Israelites were subdued at that time. The Judahites succeeded because they depended on the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 13:19 Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured [some] cities from him: Bethel and its villages, Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephron and its villages.
142Ch 13:20 Jeroboam no longer retained his power during Abijah's reign; ultimately, the LORD struck him and he died.
142Ch 13:21 However, Abijah grew strong, acquired 14 wives, and fathered 22 sons and 16 daughters.
142Ch 13:22 The rest of the events of Abijah's [reign], along with his ways and his sayings, are written about in the Writing of the Prophet Iddo.
142Ch 14:1  Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Asa became king in his place. During his reign the land experienced peace for 10 years.
142Ch 14:2  Asa did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD his God.
142Ch 14:3 He removed the pagan altars and the high places. He shattered their sacred pillars and chopped down their Asherah poles.
142Ch 14:4 He told [the people of] Judah to seek the LORD God of their ancestors and to carry out the instruction and the command.
142Ch 14:5 He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom experienced peace under him.
142Ch 14:6 Because the land experienced peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah. No one made war with him in those days because the LORD gave him rest.
142Ch 14:7 So he said to [the people of] Judah, "Let's build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we sought the LORD our God. We sought Him and He gave us rest on every side." So they built and succeeded.
142Ch 14:8 Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin bearing regular shields and drawing the bow. All these were brave warriors.
142Ch 14:9 Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of one million men and 300 chariots. They came as far as Mareshah.
142Ch 14:10 So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
142Ch 14:11 Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God: "LORD, there is no one besides You to help the mighty and those without strength. Help us, LORD our God, for we depend on You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. LORD, You are our God. Do not let a mere mortal hinder You."
142Ch 14:12 So the LORD routed the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled.
142Ch 14:13 Then Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell until they had no survivors, for they were crushed before the LORD and before His army. So the people of Judah carried off a great supply of loot.
142Ch 14:14 Then they attacked all the cities around Gerar because the terror of the LORD was on them. They also plundered all the cities, since there was a great deal of plunder in them.
142Ch 14:15 They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and captured many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
142Ch 15:1 The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded.
142Ch 15:2 So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Asa and all Judah and Benjamin, hear me. The LORD is with you when you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you abandon Him, He will abandon you.
142Ch 15:3 For many years Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law,
142Ch 15:4 but when they turned to the LORD God of Israel in their distress and sought Him, He was found by them.
142Ch 15:5 In those times there was no peace for those who went about their daily activities because the residents of the lands had many conflicts.
142Ch 15:6 Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every possible distress.
142Ch 15:7 But as for you, be strong; don't be discouraged, for your work has a reward."
142Ch 15:8 When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of [Azariah son of] Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He renovated the altar of the LORD that was in front of the vestibule of the LORD's [temple].
142Ch 15:9 Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those from [the tribes of] Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them, for they had defected to him from Israel in great numbers when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
142Ch 15:10 They were gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
142Ch 15:11 At that time they sacrificed to the LORD 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep from all the plunder they had brought.
142Ch 15:12 Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their ancestors with all their mind and all their heart.
142Ch 15:13 Whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel would be put to death, young or old, man or woman.
142Ch 15:14 They took an oath to the LORD in a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with rams' horns.
142Ch 15:15 All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their mind. They had sought Him with all their heart, and He was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
142Ch 15:16 King Asa also removed Maacah, his grandmother, from being queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. Asa chopped down her obscene image, then crushed it and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 15:17 The high places were not taken away from Israel; nevertheless, Asa was wholehearted his entire life.
142Ch 15:18 He brought his father's consecrated gifts and his own consecrated gifts into God's temple: silver, gold, and utensils.
142Ch 15:19 There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
142Ch 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa, Israel's King Baasha went to war against Judah. He built Ramah in order to deny anyone's access-- going or coming-- to Judah's King Asa.
142Ch 16:2 So Asa brought out the silver and gold from the treasuries of the LORD's temple and the royal palace and sent it to Aram's King Ben-hadad, who lived in Damascus, saying,
142Ch 16:3 "There's a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you silver and gold. Go break your treaty with Israel's King Baasha so that he will withdraw from me."
142Ch 16:4 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies to the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
142Ch 16:5 When Baasha heard [about it], he quit building Ramah and stopped his work.
142Ch 16:6 Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had built it with. Then he built Geba and Mizpah with them.
142Ch 16:7 At that time, Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and said to him, "Because you depended on the king of Aram and have not depended on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
142Ch 16:8 Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army with very many chariots and horsemen? When you depended on the LORD, He handed them over to you.
142Ch 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to show Himself strong for those whose hearts are completely His. You have been foolish in this matter, for from now on, you will have wars."
142Ch 16:10 Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison because of his anger over this. And Asa mistreated some of the people at that time.
142Ch 16:11 Note that the events of Asa's [reign], from beginning to end, are written about in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a disease in his feet, and his disease became increasingly severe. Yet even in his disease he didn't seek the LORD but the physicians.
142Ch 16:13 Asa died in the forty-first year of his reign and rested with his fathers.
142Ch 16:14 He was buried in his own tomb that he had hewn out for himself in the city of David. They laid him out in a coffin that was full of spices and various mixtures of prepared ointments; then they made a great fire in his honor.
142Ch 17:1 His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.
142Ch 17:2 He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
142Ch 17:3 Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the former ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals
142Ch 17:4 but sought the God of his father and walked by His commands, not according to the practices of Israel.
142Ch 17:5 So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. Then all Judah brought him tribute, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
142Ch 17:6 His mind rejoiced in the LORD's ways, and he again removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
142Ch 17:7 In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials-- Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah-- to teach in the cities of Judah.
142Ch 17:8 The Levites with them were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah; the priests, Elishama and Jehoram, were with these Levites.
142Ch 17:9 They taught throughout Judah, [having] the book of the LORD's instruction with them. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.
142Ch 17:10 The terror of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so they didn't fight against Jehoshaphat.
142Ch 17:11 Some of the Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats.
142Ch 17:12 Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger. He built fortresses and storage cities in Judah
142Ch 17:13 and carried out great works in the towns of Judah. He had fighting men, brave warriors, in Jerusalem.
142Ch 17:14 These are their numbers according to their ancestral families. For Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander and 300,000 brave warriors with him;
142Ch 17:15 next to him, Jehohanan the commander and 280,000 with him;
142Ch 17:16 next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer of the LORD, and 200,000 brave warriors with him;
142Ch 17:17 from Benjamin, Eliada, a brave warrior, and 200,000 with him armed with bow and shield;
142Ch 17:18 next to him, Jehozabad and 180,000 with him equipped for war.
142Ch 17:19 These were the ones who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
142Ch 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he made an alliance with Ahab through marriage.
142Ch 18:2 Then after some years, he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and for the people who were with him. Then he persuaded him to march up to Ramoth-gilead,
142Ch 18:3 for Israel's King Ahab asked Judah's King Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" He replied to him, "I am as you are, my people as your people; [we will be] with you in the battle."
142Ch 18:4 But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "First, please ask what the LORD's will is."
142Ch 18:5 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, 400 men, and asked them, "Should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war or should I refrain?" They replied, "March up, and God will hand it over to the king."
142Ch 18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of Yahweh here any more? Let's ask him."
142Ch 18:7 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king shouldn't say that," Jehoshaphat replied.
142Ch 18:8 So the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Hurry [and get] Micaiah son of Imlah!"
142Ch 18:9 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, clothed in royal attire, were each sitting on his own throne. They were sitting on the threshing floor at the entrance to Samaria's gate, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them.
142Ch 18:10 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns and said, "This is what the LORD says: 'You will gore the Arameans with these until they are finished off.'"
142Ch 18:11 And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, "March up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will hand it over to the king."
142Ch 18:12 The messenger who went to call Micaiah instructed him, "Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."
142Ch 18:13 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, I will say whatever my God says."
142Ch 18:14 So he went to the king, and the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war, or should I refrain?" Micaiah said, "March up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you."
142Ch 18:15 But the king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
142Ch 18:16 So Micaiah said: I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'They have no master; let each return home in peace.'
142Ch 18:17 So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster?"
142Ch 18:18 Then Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and the whole heavenly host was standing at His right hand and at His left hand.
142Ch 18:19 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' So one was saying this and another was saying that.
142Ch 18:20 "Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, 'I will entice him.' "The LORD asked him, 'How?'
142Ch 18:21 "So he said, 'I will go and become a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' "Then He said, 'You will entice him and also prevail. Go and do that.'
142Ch 18:22 "Now, you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit into the mouth of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you."
142Ch 18:23 Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up, hit Micaiah in the face, and demanded, "Did the Spirit of the LORD leave me to speak to you?"
142Ch 18:24 Micaiah replied, "You will soon see when you go to hide yourself in an inner chamber on that day."
142Ch 18:25 Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,
142Ch 18:26 and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this guy in prison and feed him only bread and water until I come back safely.'"
142Ch 18:27 But Micaiah said, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he said, "Listen, all you people!"
142Ch 18:28 Then the king of Israel and Judah's King Jehoshaphat went up to Ramoth-gilead.
142Ch 18:29 But the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal attire." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
142Ch 18:30 Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
142Ch 18:31 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, "He must be the king of Israel!" So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him.
142Ch 18:32 When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
142Ch 18:33 But a man drew his bow without taking special aim and struck the king of Israel through the joints of his armor. So he said to the charioteer, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!"
142Ch 18:34 The battle raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then he died at sunset.
142Ch 19:1 Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his home in Jerusalem in peace.
142Ch 19:2 Then Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to confront him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Do you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the LORD's wrath is on you.
142Ch 19:3 However, some good is found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land and have decided to seek God."
142Ch 19:4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once again he went out among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD God of their ancestors.
142Ch 19:5 He appointed judges in all the fortified cities of the land of Judah, city by city.
142Ch 19:6 Then he said to the judges, "Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the matter of judgment.
142Ch 19:7 And now, may the terror of the LORD be on you. Watch what you do, for there is no injustice or partiality or taking bribes with the LORD our God."
142Ch 19:8 Jehoshaphat also appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites and priests and some of the heads of the Israelite families for [rendering] the LORD's judgments and for [settling] disputes of the residents of Jerusalem.
142Ch 19:9 He commanded them, saying, "In the fear of the LORD, with integrity, and with a whole heart, you are to do the following:
142Ch 19:10 for every dispute that comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities-- whether it regards differences of bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, or judgments-- you are to warn them, so they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt.
142Ch 19:11 "Note that Amariah, the chief priest, is over you in all matters related to the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all matters related to the king, and the Levites are officers in your presence. Be strong; may the LORD be with those who do what is good."
142Ch 20:1 After this, the Moabites and Ammonites, together with some of the Meunites, came [to fight] against Jehoshaphat.
142Ch 20:2 People came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast multitude from beyond the Dead Sea and from Edom has come [to fight] against you; they are already in Hazazon-tamar" (that is, En-gedi).
142Ch 20:3 Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he resolved to seek the LORD. So he proclaimed a fast for all Judah,
142Ch 20:4 who gathered to seek the LORD. They even came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him.
142Ch 20:5 Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the LORD's temple before the new courtyard.
142Ch 20:6 He said: LORD God of our ancestors, are You not the God who is in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand, and no one can stand against You.
142Ch 20:7 Are You not our God who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and who gave it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend?
142Ch 20:8 They have lived in the land and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name and have said,
142Ch 20:9 "If disaster comes on us-- sword or judgment, pestilence or famine-- we will stand before this temple and before You, for Your name is in this temple. We will cry out to You because of our distress, and You will hear and deliver."
142Ch 20:10 Now here are the Ammonites, Moabites, and [the inhabitants of] Mount Seir. You did not let Israel invade them when Israel came out of the land of Egypt, but Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them.
142Ch 20:11 Look how they repay us by coming to drive us out of Your possession that You gave us as an inheritance.
142Ch 20:12 Our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this vast multitude that comes [to fight] against us. We do not know what to do, but we look to You.
142Ch 20:13 All Judah was standing before the LORD with their infants, their wives, and their children.
142Ch 20:14 In the midst of the congregation, the Spirit of the LORD came on Jahaziel (son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite from Asaph's descendants),
142Ch 20:15 and he said, "Listen carefully, all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. This is what the LORD says: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's.
142Ch 20:16 Tomorrow, go down against them. You will see them coming up the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the Wilderness of Jeruel.
142Ch 20:17 You do not have to fight this [battle]. Position yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD. [He is] with you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Tomorrow, go out to face them, for the LORD is with you.'"
142Ch 20:18 Then Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD to worship Him.
142Ch 20:19 Then the Levites from the sons of the Kohathites and the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel shouting in a loud voice.
142Ch 20:20 In the morning they got up early and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa. As they were about to go out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be established; believe in His prophets, and you will succeed."
142Ch 20:21 Then he consulted with the people and appointed some to sing for the LORD and some to praise the splendor of [His] holiness. When they went out in front of the armed forces, they kept singing: Give thanks to the LORD, for His faithful love endures forever.
142Ch 20:22 The moment they began [their] shouts and praises, the LORD set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and [the inhabitants of] Mount Seir who came [to fight] against Judah, and they were defeated.
142Ch 20:23 The Ammonites and Moabites turned against the inhabitants of Mount Seir and completely annihilated them. When they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped destroy each other.
142Ch 20:24 When Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and there were corpses lying on the ground; nobody had escaped.
142Ch 20:25 Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to gather the plunder. They found among them an abundance of goods on the bodies and valuable items. So they stripped them until nobody could carry any more. They were gathering the plunder for three days because there was so much.
142Ch 20:26 They assembled in the Valley of Beracah on the fourth day, for there they praised the LORD. Therefore, that place is still called the Valley of Beracah today.
142Ch 20:27 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem turned back with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD enabled them to rejoice over their enemies.
142Ch 20:28 So they came into Jerusalem to the LORD's temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets.
142Ch 20:29 The terror of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
142Ch 20:30 Then Jehoshaphat's kingdom was quiet, for his God gave him rest on every side.
142Ch 20:31 Jehoshaphat became king over Judah. He was 35 years old when he became king; he reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
142Ch 20:32 He walked in the way of Asa his father; he did not turn away from it but did what was right in the LORD's sight.
142Ch 20:33 However, the high places were not taken away; the people had not yet determined in their hearts [to worship] the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 20:34 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's [reign] from beginning to end are written about in the Events of Jehu son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of Israel's Kings.
142Ch 20:35 After this, Judah's King Jehoshaphat made an alliance with Israel's King Ahaziah, who was guilty of wrongdoing.
142Ch 20:36 Jehoshaphat formed an alliance with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
142Ch 20:37 Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you formed an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken up what you have made." So the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.
142Ch 21:1 Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His son Jehoram became king in his place.
142Ch 21:2 He had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
142Ch 21:3 Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable things, along with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
142Ch 21:4 When Jehoram had established himself over his father's kingdom, he strengthened his position by killing with the sword all his brothers as well as some of the princes of Israel.
142Ch 21:5 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 21:6 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab's daughter was his wife. He did what was evil in the LORD's sight,
142Ch 21:7 but because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, He was unwilling to destroy the house of David since the LORD had promised to give a lamp to David and to his sons forever.
142Ch 21:8 During Jehoram's reign, Edom rebelled against Judah's domination and appointed their own king.
142Ch 21:9 So Jehoram crossed [into Edom] with his commanders and all his chariots. Then at night he set out to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders.
142Ch 21:10 So Edom is still in rebellion against Judah's domination today. Libnah also rebelled at that time against his domination because he had abandoned the LORD God of his ancestors.
142Ch 21:11 Jehoram also built high places in the hills of Judah, and he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, and he led Judah astray.
142Ch 21:12 Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah the prophet, saying: This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: "Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or in the ways of Asa king of Judah
142Ch 21:13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves like the house of Ahab prostituted itself, and also have killed your brothers, your father's family, who were better than you,
142Ch 21:14 the LORD is now about to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a horrible affliction.
142Ch 21:15 You yourself [will be struck] with many illnesses, including a disease of the intestines, until your intestines come out day after day because of the disease."
142Ch 21:16 The LORD put it into the mind of the Philistines and the Arabs who live near the Cushites to attack Jehoram.
142Ch 21:17 So they went to war against Judah and invaded it. They carried off all the possessions found in the king's palace and also his sons and wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son.
142Ch 21:18 After all these things, the LORD afflicted him in his intestines with an incurable disease.
142Ch 21:19 This continued day after day until two full years passed. Then his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died from severe illnesses. But his people did not hold a fire in his honor like the fire in honor of his fathers.
142Ch 21:20 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. He died to no one's regret and was buried in the city of David but not in the tombs of the kings.
142Ch 22:1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, because the troops that had come with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
142Ch 22:2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king; he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri.
142Ch 22:3 He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother gave him evil advice.
142Ch 22:4 So he did what was evil in the LORD's sight like the house of Ahab, for they were his advisers after the death of his father, to his destruction.
142Ch 22:5 He also followed their advice and went with Joram son of Israel's King Ahab to fight against Hazael, king of Aram, in Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram,
142Ch 22:6 so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they inflicted on him in Ramoth-gilead when he fought against Aram's King Hazael. Then Judah's King Ahaziah son of Jehoram went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab since Joram was ill.
142Ch 22:7 With his going to Joram, Ahaziah's downfall was from God, for when Ahaziah went, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
142Ch 22:8 So it happened when Jehu executed judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them.
142Ch 22:9 Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu's soldiers captured him (he was hiding in Samaria). Then they brought him to Jehu, and they killed him. They buried him, for they said, "He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart." So the house of Ahaziah had no one to exercise power over the kingdom.
142Ch 22:10 When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah.
142Ch 22:11 Jehoshabeath, the king's daughter, rescued Joash son of Ahaziah from the king's sons who were being killed and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Now Jehoshabeath was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest. Since she was Ahaziah's sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she did not kill him.
142Ch 22:12 While Athaliah ruled over the land, he was hiding with them in God's temple six years.
142Ch 23:1 Then, in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned his courage and took the commanders of hundreds into a covenant with him: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
142Ch 23:2 They made a circuit throughout Judah. They gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
142Ch 23:3 Then the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in God's temple. Jehoiada said to them, "Here is the king's son! He must reign, just as the LORD promised concerning David's sons.
142Ch 23:4 This is what you are to do: one third of you, priests and Levites who are coming on duty on the Sabbath, are to be gatekeepers.
142Ch 23:5 A third are to be at the king's palace, and a third are to be at the Foundation Gate, and all the troops will be in the courtyards of the LORD's temple.
142Ch 23:6 No one is to enter the LORD's temple but the priests and those Levites who serve; they may enter because they are holy, but all the people are to obey the requirement of the LORD.
142Ch 23:7 You must completely surround the king with weapons in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. You must be with the king in all his daily tasks."
142Ch 23:8 So the commanders of hundreds did everything Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each brought their men-- those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty on the Sabbath-- for Jehoiada the priest did not release the divisions.
142Ch 23:9 Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds King David's spears, shields, and quivers that were in God's temple.
142Ch 23:10 Then he stationed all the troops with their weapons in hand surrounding the king-- from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple.
142Ch 23:11 They brought out the king's son, put the crown on him, gave him the testimony, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and cried, "Long live the king!"
142Ch 23:12 When Athaliah heard the noise from the troops, the guards, and those praising the king, she went to the troops in the LORD's temple.
142Ch 23:13 As she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets while the singers with musical instruments were leading the praise. Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, "Treason, treason!"
142Ch 23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds, those in charge of the army, saying, "Take her out between the ranks, and put anyone who follows her to death by the sword," for the priest had said, "Don't put her to death in the LORD's temple."
142Ch 23:15 So they arrested her, and she went by the entrance of the Horses' Gate to the king's palace, where they put her to death.
142Ch 23:16 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD's people.
142Ch 23:17 So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They broke its altars and images into pieces and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, at the altars.
142Ch 23:18 Then Jehoiada put the oversight of the LORD's temple into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom David had appointed over the LORD's temple, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and song ordained by David.
142Ch 23:19 He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the LORD's temple so that nothing unclean could enter for any reason.
142Ch 23:20 Then he took [with him] the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the LORD's temple. They entered the king's palace through the upper [gate] and seated the king on the throne of the kingdom.
142Ch 23:21 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death by the sword.
142Ch 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he became king; he reigned 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah; [she was] from Beer-sheba.
142Ch 24:2 Throughout the time of Jehoiada the priest, Joash did what was right in the LORD's sight.
142Ch 24:3 Jehoiada acquired two wives for him, and he was the father of sons and daughters.
142Ch 24:4 Afterwards, Joash took it to heart to renovate the LORD's temple.
142Ch 24:5 So he gathered the priests and Levites and said, "Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the temple of your God as needed year by year, and do it quickly." However, the Levites did not hurry.
142Ch 24:6 So the king called Jehoiada the high [priest] and said, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax [imposed by] the LORD's servant Moses and the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?
142Ch 24:7 For the sons of that wicked Athaliah broke into the LORD's temple and even used the sacred things of the LORD's temple for the Baals."
142Ch 24:8 At the king's command a chest was made and placed outside the gate of the LORD's temple.
142Ch 24:9 Then a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem that the tax God's servant Moses [imposed] on Israel in the wilderness be brought to the LORD.
142Ch 24:10 All the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought [the tax], and put it in the chest until it was full.
142Ch 24:11 Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king's overseers, and when they saw that there was a large amount of money, the king's secretary and the high priest's deputy came and emptied the chest, picked it up, and returned it to its place. They did this daily and gathered the money in abundance.
142Ch 24:12 Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those in charge of the labor on the LORD's temple, who were hiring masons and carpenters to renovate the LORD's temple, also blacksmiths and coppersmiths to repair the LORD's temple.
142Ch 24:13 The workmen did their work, and through them the repairs progressed. They restored God's temple to its specifications and reinforced it.
142Ch 24:14 When they finished, they presented the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, who made articles for the LORD's temple with it-- articles for ministry and for making burnt offerings, and ladles and articles of gold and silver. They regularly offered burnt offerings in the LORD's temple throughout Jehoiada's life.
142Ch 24:15 Jehoiada died when he was old and full of days; he was 130 years old at his death.
142Ch 24:16 He was buried in the city of David with the kings because he had done [what was] good in Israel with respect to God and His temple.
142Ch 24:17 However, after Jehoiada died, the rulers of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them,
142Ch 24:18 and they abandoned the temple of the LORD God of their ancestors and served the Asherah poles and the idols. So there was wrath against Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
142Ch 24:19 Nevertheless, He sent them prophets to bring them back to the LORD; they admonished them, but they would not listen.
142Ch 24:20 The Spirit of God took control of Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood above the people and said to them, "This is what God says: 'Why are you transgressing the LORD's commands and you do not prosper? Because you have abandoned the LORD, He has abandoned you.'"
142Ch 24:21 But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king's command in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.
142Ch 24:22 King Joash didn't remember the kindness that Zechariah's father Jehoiada had extended to him, but killed his son. While he was dying, he said, "May the LORD see and demand an account."
142Ch 24:23 At the turn of the year, an Aramean army went to war against Joash. They entered Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people among them and sent all the plunder to the king of Damascus.
142Ch 24:24 Although the Aramean army came with only a few men, the LORD handed over a vast army to them because the people of Judah had abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors. So they executed judgment on Joash.
142Ch 24:25 When the Arameans saw that Joash had many wounds, they left him. His servants conspired against him, and killed him on his bed, because he had shed the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
142Ch 24:26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of the Ammonite woman Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of the Moabite woman Shimrith.
142Ch 24:27 Concerning his sons, the many oracles about him, and the restoration of the LORD's temple, they are recorded in the Writing of the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah became king in his place.
142Ch 25:1 Amaziah became king [when he was] 25 years old; he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan; [she was] from Jerusalem.
142Ch 25:2 He did what was right in the LORD's sight but not completely.
142Ch 25:3 As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king.
142Ch 25:4 However, he did not put their children to death, because-- as it is written in the Law, in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded-- "Fathers must not die because of children, and children must not die because of fathers, but each one will die for his own sin."
142Ch 25:5 Then Amaziah gathered Judah and assembled them according to patriarchal family, according to commanders of thousands, and according to commanders of hundreds. He numbered those 20 years old or more for all Judah and Benjamin. He found there to be 300,000 choice men who could serve in the army, bearing spear and shield.
142Ch 25:6 Then for 7,500 pounds of silver he hired 100,000 brave warriors from Israel.
142Ch 25:7 However, a man of God came to him and said, "King, do not let Israel's army go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel-- all the Ephraimites.
142Ch 25:8 But if you go [with them], do it! Be strong for battle! [But] God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to make one stumble.
142Ch 25:9 Then Amaziah said to the man of God, "What should I do about the 7,500 pounds of silver I gave to Israel's division?" The man of God replied, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this."
142Ch 25:10 So Amaziah released the division that came to him from Ephraim to go home. But they got very angry with Judah and returned home in a fierce rage.
142Ch 25:11 Amaziah strengthened his position and led his people to the Valley of Salt. He struck down 10,000 Seirites,
142Ch 25:12 and the Judahites captured 10,000 alive. They took them to the top of a cliff where they threw them off, and all of them were dashed to pieces.
142Ch 25:13 As for the men of the division that Amaziah sent back so they would not go with him into battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, struck down 3,000 of their people, and took a great deal of plunder.
142Ch 25:14 After Amaziah came from the attack on the Edomites, he brought the gods of the Seirites and set them up as his gods. He worshiped before them and burned incense to them.
142Ch 25:15 So the LORD's anger was against Amaziah, and He sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why have you sought a people's gods that could not deliver their own people from your hand?"
142Ch 25:16 While he was still speaking to him, the king asked, "Have we made you the king's counselor? Stop, why should you lose your life?" So the prophet stopped, but he said, "I know that God intends to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice."
142Ch 25:17 King Amaziah of Judah took counsel and sent [word] to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us meet face to face."
142Ch 25:18 King Jehoash of Israel sent [word] to King Amaziah of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent [a message] to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
142Ch 25:19 You have said, 'Look, I have defeated Edom,' and you have become overconfident that you will get glory. Now stay at home. Why stir up such trouble so that you fall and Judah with you?"
142Ch 25:20 But Amaziah would not listen, for this [turn of events] was from God in order to hand them over to [their enemies] because they went after the gods of Edom.
142Ch 25:21 So King Jehoash of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced off at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
142Ch 25:22 Judah was routed before Israel, and each fled to his own tent.
142Ch 25:23 King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah's King Amaziah son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh. Then Jehoash took him to Jerusalem and broke down 200 yards of Jerusalem's wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
142Ch 25:24 He took all the gold, silver, all the utensils that were found with Obed-edom in God's temple, the treasures of the king's palace, and the hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
142Ch 25:25 Judah's King Amaziah son of Joash lived 15 years after the death of Israel's King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz.
142Ch 25:26 The rest of the events of Amaziah's [reign], from beginning to end, are written about in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 25:27 From the time Amaziah turned from following the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. However, [men] were sent after him to Lachish, and they put him to death there.
142Ch 25:28 They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
142Ch 26:1 All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
142Ch 26:2 He rebuilt Elothand restored it to Judah after [Amaziah] the king rested with his fathers.
142Ch 26:3 Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king; he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah; [she was] from Jerusalem.
142Ch 26:4 He did what was right in the LORD's sight as his father Amaziah had done.
142Ch 26:5 He sought God throughout the lifetime of Zechariah, the teacher of the fear of God. During the time that he sought the LORD, God gave him success.
142Ch 26:6 Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines, and he tore down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Then he built cities in [the vicinity of] Ashdod and among the Philistines.
142Ch 26:7 God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabs that live in Gur-baal, and the Meunites.
142Ch 26:8 The Ammonites gave Uzziah tribute money, and his fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for [God] made [him] very powerful.
142Ch 26:9 Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the corner buttress, and he fortified them.
142Ch 26:10 Since he had many cattle both in the lowlands and the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many wells. And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands.
142Ch 26:11 Uzziah had an army equipped for combat that went out to war by division according to the their assignments, as recorded by Jeiel the court secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders.
142Ch 26:12 The total number of heads of families was 2,600 brave warriors.
142Ch 26:13 Under their authority was an army of 307,500 equipped for combat, a powerful force to help the king against the enemy.
142Ch 26:14 Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows and slingstones.
142Ch 26:15 He made skillfully designed devices in Jerusalem to shoot arrows and [catapult] large stones for use on the towers and on the corners. So his fame spread even to distant places, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong.
142Ch 26:16 But when he became strong, he grew arrogant and it led to his own destruction. He acted unfaithfully against the LORD his God by going into the LORD's sanctuary to burn incense on the incense altar.
142Ch 26:17 Azariah the priest, along with 80 brave priests of the Lord, went in after him.
142Ch 26:18 They took their stand against King Uzziah and said, "Uzziah, you have no right to offer incense to the LORD-- only the consecrated priests, the descendants of Aaron, have the right to offer incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully! You will not receive honor from the LORD God."
142Ch 26:19 Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But when he became enraged with the priests, in the presence of the priests in the LORD's temple beside the altar of incense, a skin disease broke out on his forehead.
142Ch 26:20 Then Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw that he was diseased on his forehead. They rushed him out of there. He himself also hurried to get out because the LORD had afflicted him.
142Ch 26:21 So King Uzziah was diseased to the time of his death. He lived in quarantinewith a serious skin disease and was excluded from access to the LORD's temple, while his son Jotham was over the king's household governing the people of the land.
142Ch 26:22 Now the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz wrote about the rest of the events of Uzziah's [reign], from beginning to end.
142Ch 26:23 Uzziah rested with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the burial ground of the kings' cemetery, for they said, "He has a skin disease." His son Jotham became king in his place.
142Ch 27:1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
142Ch 27:2 He did what was right in the LORD's sight as his father Uzziah had done, except that he didn't enter the LORD's sanctuary. However, the people still behaved corruptly.
142Ch 27:3 Jotham built the Upper Gate of the LORD's temple, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel.
142Ch 27:4 He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
142Ch 27:5 He waged war against the king of the Ammonites. He overpowered the Ammonites, and that year they gave him 7,500 pounds of silver, 50,000 bushels of wheat, and 50,000 bushels of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years.
142Ch 27:6 So Jotham strengthened himself because he did not waver in obeying the LORD his God.
142Ch 27:7 As for the rest of the events of Jotham's [reign], along with all his wars and his ways, note that they are written about in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 27:8 He was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 27:9 Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Ahaz became king in his place.
142Ch 28:1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king; he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the LORD's sight like his forefather David,
142Ch 28:2 for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and made cast images of the Baals.
142Ch 28:3 He burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and burned his children in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
142Ch 28:4 He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
142Ch 28:5 So the LORD his God handed Ahaz over to the king of Aram. He attacked him and took many captives to Damascus. Ahaz was also handed over to the king of Israel, who struck him with great force:
142Ch 28:6 Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day-- all brave men-- because they had abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors.
142Ch 28:7 An Ephraimite warrior named Zichri killed the king's son Maaseiah, Azrikam governor of the palace, and Elkanah who was second to the king.
142Ch 28:8 Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their brothers-- women, sons, and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder from them and brought it to Samaria.
142Ch 28:9 A prophet of the LORD named Oded was there. He went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, "Look, the LORD God of your ancestors handed them over to you because of His wrath against Judah, but you slaughtered them in a rage that has reached heaven.
142Ch 28:10 Now you plan to reduce the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, to slavery. Are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
142Ch 28:11 Listen to me and return the captives you took from your brothers, for the LORD's fierce wrath is on you."
142Ch 28:12 So some men who were leaders of the Ephraimites-- Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai-- stood in opposition to those coming from the war.
142Ch 28:13 They said to them, "You must not bring the captives here, for you plan to bring guilt on us from the LORD to add to our sins and our guilt. For we have much guilt, and fierce wrath is on Israel."
142Ch 28:14 The army left the captives and the plunder in the presence of the officers and the congregation.
142Ch 28:15 Then the men who were designated by name took charge of the captives and provided clothes for their naked ones from the plunder. They clothed them, gave them sandals, food and drink, dressed their wounds, and provided donkeys for all the feeble. The Israelites brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, among their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.
142Ch 28:16 At that time King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help.
142Ch 28:17 The Edomites came again, attacked Judah, and took captives.
142Ch 28:18 The Philistines also raided the cities of the Judean foothills and the Negev of Judah and captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its villages, Timnah and its villages, Gimzo and its villages, and they lived there.
142Ch 28:19 For the LORD humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Judah, who threw off restraint in Judah and was unfaithful to the LORD.
142Ch 28:20 Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against Ahaz; he oppressed him and did not give him support.
142Ch 28:21 Although Ahaz plundered the LORD's temple and the palace of the king and of the rulers and gave the plunder to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.
142Ch 28:22 At the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the LORD.
142Ch 28:23 He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him; he said, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me." But they were the downfall of him and of all Israel.
142Ch 28:24 Then Ahaz gathered up the utensils of God's temple, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the LORD's temple, and made himself altars on every street corner in Jerusalem.
142Ch 28:25 He made high places in every city of Judah to offer incense to other gods, and he provoked the God of his ancestors.
142Ch 28:26 As for the rest of his deeds and all his ways, from beginning to end, they are written about in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 28:27 Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city, in Jerusalem, and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
142Ch 29:1 Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
142Ch 29:2 He did what was right in the LORD's sight just as his ancestor David had done.
142Ch 29:3 In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the LORD's temple and repaired them.
142Ch 29:4 Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the eastern public square.
142Ch 29:5 He said to them, "Hear me, Levites. Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the LORD God of your ancestors. Remove everything detestable from the holy place.
142Ch 29:6 For our fathers were unfaithful and did what is evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the LORD's tabernacle, and turned their backs on Him.
142Ch 29:7 They also closed the doors of the vestibule, extinguished the lamps, did not burn incense, and did not offer burnt offerings in the holy place of the God of Israel.
142Ch 29:8 Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was on Judah and Jerusalem, and He made them an object of terror, horror, and hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
142Ch 29:9 Our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this.
142Ch 29:10 It is in my heart now to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel so that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.
142Ch 29:11 My sons, don't be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in His presence, to serve Him, and to be His ministers and burners of incense."
142Ch 29:12 Then the Levites stood up: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
142Ch 29:13 Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
142Ch 29:14 Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites; Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
142Ch 29:15 They gathered their brothers together, consecrated themselves, and went according to the king's command by the words of the LORD to cleanse the LORD's temple.
142Ch 29:16 The priests went to the entrance of the LORD's temple to cleanse it. They took all the detestable things they found in the LORD's sanctuary to the courtyard of the LORD's temple. Then the Levites received them and took them outside to the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 29:17 They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD's [temple]. They consecrated the LORD's temple for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.
142Ch 29:18 Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, "We have cleansed the whole temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the rows [of the bread of the Presence] and all its utensils.
142Ch 29:19 All the utensils that King Ahaz rejected during his reign when he became unfaithful we have set up and consecrated. They are in front of the altar of the LORD."
142Ch 29:20 King Hezekiah got up early, gathered the city officials, and went up to the LORD's temple.
142Ch 29:21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he told the descendants of Aaron, the priests, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
142Ch 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
142Ch 29:23 Then they brought the sin offering goats right into the presence of the king and the congregation, who laid their hands on them.
142Ch 29:24 The priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel, for the king said that the burnt offering and sin offering were for all Israel.
142Ch 29:25 Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the LORD's temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. For the command was from the LORD through His prophets.
142Ch 29:26 The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
142Ch 29:27 Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. When the burnt offerings began, the song of the LORD and the trumpets began, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
142Ch 29:28 The whole assembly was worshiping, singing the song, and blowing the trumpets-- all of this [continued] until the burnt offering was completed.
142Ch 29:29 When the burnt offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped.
142Ch 29:30 Then King Hezekiah and the officials told the Levites to sing praise to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with rejoicing and bowed down and worshiped.
142Ch 29:31 Hezekiah concluded, "Now you are consecrated to the LORD. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the LORD's temple." So the congregation brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all those with willing hearts brought burnt offerings.
142Ch 29:32 The number of burnt offerings the congregation brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
142Ch 29:33 Six hundred bulls and 3,000 sheep were consecrated.
142Ch 29:34 However, since there were not enough priests, they weren't able to skin all the burnt offerings, so their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests were.
142Ch 29:35 Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the fellowship offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offering. So the service of the LORD's temple was established.
142Ch 29:36 Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over how God had prepared the people, for it had come about suddenly.
142Ch 30:1 Then Hezekiah sent [word] throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the LORD's temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover of the LORD God of Israel.
142Ch 30:2 For the king and his officials and the entire congregation in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover of the LORD in the second month
142Ch 30:3 because they were not able to observe it at the appropriate time, since not enough of the priests had consecrated themselves and the people hadn't been gathered together in Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:4 The proposal pleased the king and the congregation,
142Ch 30:5 so they affirmed the proposal and spread the message throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, to come to observe the Passover of the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem, for they hadn't observed it often, as prescribed.
142Ch 30:6 So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the hand of the king and his officials, and according to the king's command, saying, "Israelites, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped from the grasp of the kings of Assyria.
142Ch 30:7 Don't be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to the LORD God of their ancestors so that He made them an object of horror as you yourselves see.
142Ch 30:8 Don't become obstinate now like your fathers did. Give your allegiance to the LORD, and come to His sanctuary that He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God so that He may turn His fierce wrath away from you,
142Ch 30:9 for when you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons [will receive] mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn [His] face away from you if you return to Him."
142Ch 30:10 The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants laughed at them and mocked them.
142Ch 30:11 But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:12 Also, the hand of God was in Judah to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and his officials by the word of the LORD.
142Ch 30:13 A very large assembly of people was gathered in Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
142Ch 30:14 They proceeded to take away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 30:15 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the LORD's temple.
142Ch 30:16 They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood [received] from the hand of the Levites,
142Ch 30:17 for there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, and so the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover [lambs] for every unclean person to consecrate [the lambs] to the LORD.
142Ch 30:18 For a large number of the people-- many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun-- were unclean, yet they had eaten the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah had interceded for them, saying, "May the good LORD provide atonement on behalf of
142Ch 30:19 whoever sets his whole heart on seeking God, the LORD God of his ancestors, even though not according to the purification [rules] of the sanctuary."
142Ch 30:20 So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
142Ch 30:21 The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day after day with loud instruments.
142Ch 30:22 Then Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. They ate the appointed feast for seven days, sacrificing fellowship offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their ancestors.
142Ch 30:23 The whole congregation decided to observe seven more days, so they observed seven days with joy,
142Ch 30:24 for Hezekiah king of Judah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for the congregation. Also, the officials contributed 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep for the congregation, and many priests consecrated themselves.
142Ch 30:25 Then the whole assembly of Judah with the priests and Levites, the whole assembly that came from Israel, the foreigners who came from the land of Israel, and those who were living in Judah, rejoiced.
142Ch 30:26 Such rejoicing had not been seen in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel.
142Ch 30:27 Then the priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard their voice, and their prayer came into His holy dwelling place in heaven.
142Ch 31:1 When all this was completed, all Israel who had attended went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, to the last one.Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own possession.
142Ch 31:2 Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites for the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD, each division corresponding to his service among the priests and Levites.
142Ch 31:3 The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings of the Sabbaths, of the New Moons, and of the appointed feasts, as written in the law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:4 He told the people who lived in Jerusalem to give a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote their energy to the law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:5 When the word spread, the Israelites gave liberally of the best of the grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought an abundant tenth of everything.
142Ch 31:6 As for the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah, they also [brought] a tenth of the cattle and sheep, and a tenth of the dedicated things that were consecrated to the LORD their God. They gathered [them] into large piles.
142Ch 31:7 In the third month they began building up the piles, and they finished in the seventh month.
142Ch 31:8 When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the piles, they praised the LORD and His people Israel.
142Ch 31:9 Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles.
142Ch 31:10 Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, "Since they began bringing the offering to the LORD's temple, we eat and are satisfied and there is plenty left over because the LORD has blessed His people; this abundance is what is left over."
142Ch 31:11 Hezekiah told them to prepare chambers in the LORD's temple, and they prepared [them].
142Ch 31:12 The offering, the tenth, and the dedicated things were brought faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.
142Ch 31:13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were deputies under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the ruler of God's temple.
142Ch 31:14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings to God to distribute the contribution to the LORD and the consecrated things.
142Ch 31:15 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests were to faithfully distribute [it] under his authority to their brothers by divisions, whether large or small.
142Ch 31:16 In addition, [they distributed it] to males registered by genealogy three years old and above; to all who would enter the LORD's temple for their daily duty, for their service in their responsibilities according to their divisions.
142Ch 31:17 [They distributed also] to those recorded by genealogy of the priests by their ancestral families and the Levites 20 years old and above, by their responsibilities in their divisions;
142Ch 31:18 to those registered by genealogy-- with all their infants, wives, sons, and daughters-- of the whole assembly (for they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy);
142Ch 31:19 and to the descendants of Aaron, the priests, in the common fields of their cities, in each and every city. [There were] men who were registered by name to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every Levite recorded by genealogy.
142Ch 31:20 Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.
142Ch 31:21 He was diligent in every deed that he began in the service of God's temple, in the law and in the commandment, in order to seek his God, and he prospered.
142Ch 32:1 After these faithful deeds, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities and intended to break into them.
142Ch 32:2 Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he planned war on Jerusalem,
142Ch 32:3 so he consulted with his officials and his warriors about stopping up the waters of the springs that were outside the city, and they helped him.
142Ch 32:4 Many people gathered and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land; they said, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?"
142Ch 32:5 Then Hezekiah strengthened his position by rebuilding the entire broken-down wall and heightening the towers and the other outside wall. He repaired the supporting terraces of the city of David, and made an abundance of weapons and shields.
142Ch 32:6 He set military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying,
142Ch 32:7 "Be strong and courageous! Don't be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria or before all the multitude with him, for there are more with us than with him.
142Ch 32:8 He has only human strength,but we have the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." So the people relied on the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.
142Ch 32:9 After this, while Sennacherib king of Assyria with all his armed forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem against King Hezekiah of Judah and against all those of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,
142Ch 32:10 "This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: 'What are you trusting in, you who remain under the siege of Jerusalem?
142Ch 32:11 Isn't Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, "The LORD our God will deliver us from the power of the king of Assyria"?
142Ch 32:12 Didn't Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem: "You must worship before one altar, and you must burn incense on it"?
142Ch 32:13 " 'Don't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have any of the national gods of the lands been able to deliver their land from my power?
142Ch 32:14 Who among all the gods of these nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people from my power, that your God should be able to do the same for you?
142Ch 32:15 So now, don't let Hezekiah deceive you, and don't let him mislead you like this. Don't believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my power or the power of my fathers. How much less will your gods deliver you from my power!'"
142Ch 32:16 His servants said more against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
142Ch 32:17 He also wrote letters to mock the LORD God of Israel, saying against Him: Just like the national gods of the lands that did not deliver their people from my power, so Hezekiah's God will not deliver His people from my power.
142Ch 32:18 Then they called out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to frighten and discourage them in order that he might capture the city.
142Ch 32:19 They spoke against the God of Jerusalem like they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the land, which were made by human hands.
142Ch 32:20 King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven,
142Ch 32:21 and the LORD sent an angel who annihilated every brave warrior, leader, and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned with shame to his land. He went to the temple of his god, and there some of his own children cut him down with the sword.
142Ch 32:22 So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the power of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the power of all others. He gave them rest on every side.
142Ch 32:23 Many were bringing an offering to the LORD to Jerusalem and valuable gifts to King Hezekiah of Judah, and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after that.
142Ch 32:24 In those days Hezekiah became sick to the point of death, so he prayed to the LORD, and He spoke to him and gave him a miraculous sign.
142Ch 32:25 However, because his heart was proud, Hezekiah didn't respond according to the benefit that had come to him. So there was wrath upon him, upon Judah, and upon Jerusalem.
142Ch 32:26 Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart-- he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem-- so the LORD's wrath didn't come on them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
142Ch 32:27 Hezekiah had abundant riches and glory, and he made himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and every desirable item.
142Ch 32:28 He made warehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and pens for flocks.
142Ch 32:29 He made cities for himself, and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave him abundant possessions.
142Ch 32:30 This same Hezekiah blocked the outlet of the water of the Upper Gihon and channeled it smoothly downward and westward to the city of David. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did.
142Ch 32:31 When the ambassadors of Babylon's rulers were sent to him to inquire about the miraculous sign that happened in the land, God left him to test him and discover what was in his heart.
142Ch 32:32 As for the rest of the events of Hezekiah's [reign] and his deeds of faithful love, note that they are written about in the Visions of the Prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 32:33 Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the ascent to the tombs of David's descendants. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. His son Manasseh became king in his place.
142Ch 33:1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king; he reigned 55 years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 33:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, imitating the detestable practices of the nations that the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.
142Ch 33:3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down and reestablished the altars for the Baals. He made Asherah poles, and he worshiped the whole heavenly host and served them.
142Ch 33:4 He built altars in the LORD's temple, where the LORD had said: "Jerusalem is where My name will remain forever."
142Ch 33:5 He built altars to the whole heavenly host in both courtyards of the LORD's temple.
142Ch 33:6 He passed his sons through the fire in the Valley of Hinnom. He practiced witchcraft, divination, and sorcery, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did a great deal of evil in the LORD's sight, provoking Him.
142Ch 33:7 Manasseh set up a carved image of the idol he had made, in God's temple, about which God had said to David and his son Solomon: "I will establish My name forever in this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
142Ch 33:8 I will never again remove the feet of the Israelites from upon the land where I stationed your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them through Moses-- all the law, statutes, and judgments."
142Ch 33:9 So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to stray so that they did worse evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
142Ch 33:10 The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they didn't listen.
142Ch 33:11 So He brought against them the military commanders of the king of Assyria. They captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze [shackles], and took him to Babylon.
142Ch 33:12 When he was in distress, he sought the favor of the LORD his God and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.
142Ch 33:13 He prayed to Him, so He heard his petition and granted his request, and brought him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom. So Manasseh came to know that the LORD is God.
142Ch 33:14 After this, he built the outer wall of the city of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate; he brought it around the Ophel, and he heightened it considerably. He also placed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
142Ch 33:15 He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the LORD's temple, along with all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the LORD's temple and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city.
142Ch 33:16 He built the altar of the LORD and offered fellowship and thank offerings on it. Then he told Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
142Ch 33:17 However, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
142Ch 33:18 The rest of the events of Manasseh's [reign], along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, are [written about] in the Events of Israel's Kings.
142Ch 33:19 His prayer and how God granted his request, and all his sin and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and carved images before he humbled himself, they are written about in the Records of Hozai.
142Ch 33:20 Manasseh rested with his fathers, and he was buried in his own house. His son Amon became king in his place.
142Ch 33:21 Amon was 22 years old when he became king; he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 33:22 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight just as his father Manasseh had done. Amon sacrificed to all the carved images that his father Manasseh had made, and he served them.
142Ch 33:23 But he did not humble himself before the LORD like his father Manasseh humbled himself; instead, Amon increased [his] guilt.
142Ch 33:24 So his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.
142Ch 33:25 Then the common people executed all those who conspired against King Amon and made his son Josiah king in his place.
142Ch 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king; he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:2 He did what was right in the LORD's sight and walked in the ways of his ancestor David; he did not turn aside to the right or the left.
142Ch 34:3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a youth, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved images, and the cast images.
142Ch 34:4 Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down, and the incense altars that were above them he chopped down. The Asherah poles, the carved images, and the cast images he shattered, crushed to dust, and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
142Ch 34:5 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:6 [He did the same] in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali [and] on their surrounding mountain shrines.
142Ch 34:7 He tore down the altars, and he smashed the Asherah poles and the carved images to powder. He chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel and returned to Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, in order to cleanse the land and the temple, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, along with Maaseiah the governor of the city and the recorder Joah son of Joahaz, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.
142Ch 34:9 So they went to Hilkiah the high priest, and gave him the money brought into God's temple. The Levites and the doorkeepers had collected [money] from Manasseh, Ephraim, and from the entire remnant of Israel, and from all Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:10 They put it into the hands of those doing the work-- those who oversaw the LORD's temple. They [in turn] gave it to the workmen who were working in the LORD's temple, to repair and restore the temple;
142Ch 34:11 they gave it to the carpenters and builders and [also used it] to buy quarried stone and timbers-- for joining and to make beams-- for the buildings that Judah's Kings had destroyed.
142Ch 34:12 The men were doing the work with integrity. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites as supervisors. The Levites were all skilled on musical instruments.
142Ch 34:13 [They were] also over the porters and were supervising all those doing the work task by task. Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.
142Ch 34:14 When they brought out the money that had been deposited in the LORD's temple, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD [written] by the hand of Moses.
142Ch 34:15 Consequently, Hilkiah told Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the LORD's temple," and he gave the book to Shaphan.
142Ch 34:16 Shaphan took the book to the king, and also reported, "Your servants are doing all that was placed in their hands.
142Ch 34:17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the LORD's temple and have put it into the hand of the overseers and the hand of those doing the work."
142Ch 34:18 Then Shaphan the court secretary told the king, "Hilkiah the priest gave me a book," and Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
142Ch 34:19 When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.
142Ch 34:20 Then he commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the court secretary, and the king's servant Asaiah,
142Ch 34:21 "Go. Inquire of the LORD for me and for those remaining in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the book that was found. For great is the LORD's wrath that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD in order to do everything written in this book."
142Ch 34:22 So Hilkiah and those the king had designated went to the prophetess Huldah, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second District. They spoke with her about this.
142Ch 34:23 She said to them, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says: Say to the man who sent you to Me,
142Ch 34:24 'This is what the LORD says: I am about to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, [fulfilling] all the curses written in the book that they read in the presence of the king of Judah,
142Ch 34:25 because they have abandoned Me and burned incense to other gods in order to provoke Me with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.'
142Ch 34:26 Say this to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD: 'This is what the LORD God of Israel says: As for the words that you heard,
142Ch 34:27 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and because you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I Myself have heard'-- this is the LORD speaking.
142Ch 34:28 'I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster that I am bringing on this place and on its inhabitants.' " Then they reported to the king.
142Ch 34:29 So the king sent [messengers] and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:30 Then the king went up to the LORD's temple with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the Levites-- all the people from great to small. He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the LORD's temple.
142Ch 34:31 Next the king stood at his post and made a covenant in the LORD's presence to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, His decrees, and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul in order to carry out the words of the covenant written in this book.
142Ch 34:32 Then he had all those present in Jerusalem and Benjamin enter [the covenant]. So all the inhabitants of Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 34:33 So Josiah removed everything that was detestable from all the lands belonging to the Israelites, and he required all who were present in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD God of their ancestors.
142Ch 35:1 Josiah observed the LORD's Passover and slaughtered the Passover [lambs] on the fourteenth day of the first month.
142Ch 35:2 He appointed the priests to their responsibilities and encouraged them to serve in the LORD's temple.
142Ch 35:3 He said to the Levites who taught all Israel the holy things of the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon son of David king of Israel. Since you do not have to carry it on your shoulders, now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.
142Ch 35:4 "Organize your ancestral houses by your divisions according to the written instruction of David king of Israel and that of his son Solomon.
142Ch 35:5 Serve in the holy place by the divisions of the ancestral houses for your brothers, the lay people, and the distribution of the tribal household of the Levites.
142Ch 35:6 Slaughter the Passover [lambs], consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your brothers to carry out the word of the LORD through Moses."
142Ch 35:7 Then Josiah donated 30,000 sheep, lambs, and kid goats, plus 3,000 bulls from his own possessions, for the Passover sacrifices for all the lay people who were present.
142Ch 35:8 His officials also donated willingly for the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders of God's temple, gave 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 bulls for the priests.
142Ch 35:9 Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated 5,000 Passover sacrifices for the Levites, plus 500 bulls.
142Ch 35:10 So the service was established; the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.
142Ch 35:11 Then they slaughtered the Passover [lambs], and while the Levites were skinning the [animals], the priests sprinkled the blood they had been given.
142Ch 35:12 They removed the burnt offerings so that they might be given to the divisions of the ancestral houses of the lay people to offer to the LORD, according to what is written in the book of Moses; [they did] the same with the bulls.
142Ch 35:13 They roasted the Passover [lambs] with fire according to regulation. They boiled the holy [sacrifices] in pots, in kettles, and in bowls; and they quickly brought [them] to the lay people.
142Ch 35:14 Afterwards, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were busy offering up burnt offerings and fat until night. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
142Ch 35:15 The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer. Also, the gatekeepers were at each gate. Because their Levite brothers had made preparations for them, none of them left their tasks.
142Ch 35:16 So all the service of the LORD was established that day for observing the Passover and for offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
142Ch 35:17 The Israelites who were present [in Judah] also observed the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
142Ch 35:18 No Passover had been observed like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites who were present [in Judah], and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
142Ch 35:19 In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, this Passover was observed.
142Ch 35:20 After all this that Josiah had prepared for the temple, Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him.
142Ch 35:21 But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What is [the issue] between you and me, king of Judah? I have not come against you today but to the dynasty I am fighting. God told me to hurry. Stop opposing God who is with me; don't make Him destroy you!"
142Ch 35:22 But Josiah did not turn away from him; instead, in order to fight with him he disguised himself. He did not listen to Neco's words from the mouth of God, but went to the Valley of Megiddo to fight.
142Ch 35:23 The archers shot King Josiah, and he said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am severely wounded!"
142Ch 35:24 So his servants took him out of the war chariot, carried him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem. Then he died, and they buried him in the tomb of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
142Ch 35:25 Jeremiah chanted a dirge over Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women still speak of Josiah in their dirges to this very day. They established them as a statute for Israel, and indeed they are written in the Dirges.
142Ch 35:26 The rest of the events of Josiah's [reign], along with his deeds of faithful love according to what is written in the law of the LORD,
142Ch 35:27 and his words, from beginning to end, are written about in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 36:1 Then the common people took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
142Ch 36:2 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king; he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:3 The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and fined the land 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold.
142Ch 36:4 Then [Neco] king of Egypt made Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.
142Ch 36:5 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king; he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
142Ch 36:6 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him in bronze [shackles] to take him to Babylon.
142Ch 36:7 Also Nebuchadnezzar took some of the utensils of the LORD's temple to Babylon and put them in his temple in Babylon.
142Ch 36:8 The rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, the detestable things he did, and what was found against him, are written about in the Book of Israel's Kings. His brother Jehoiachin became king in his place.
142Ch 36:9 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king; he reigned three months and 10 days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
142Ch 36:10 In the spring Nebuchadnezzar sent [for him] and brought him to Babylon along with the valuable utensils of the LORD's temple. Then he made Jehoiachin's brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:11 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king; he reigned 11 years in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:12 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet at the LORD's command.
142Ch 36:13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear allegiance by God. He became obstinate and hardened his heart against returning to the LORD God of Israel.
142Ch 36:14 All the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied their unfaithful deeds, imitating all the detestable practices of the nations, and they defiled the LORD's temple that He had consecrated in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:15 But the LORD God of their ancestors sent word against them by the hand of his messengers, sending them time and time again, for He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.
142Ch 36:16 But they kept ridiculing God's messengers, despising His words, and scoffing at His prophets, until the LORD's wrath was so stirred up against His people that there was no remedy.
142Ch 36:17 So He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their choice young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He had no pity on young man and virgin or elderly and aged; He handed them all over to him.
142Ch 36:18 He took everything to Babylon-- all the articles of God's temple, large and small, the treasures of the LORD's temple, and the treasures of the king and his officials.
142Ch 36:19 Then the Chaldeans burned God's temple. They tore down Jerusalem's wall, burned down all its palaces, and destroyed all its valuable utensils.
142Ch 36:20 Those who escaped from the sword he deported to Babylon, and they became servants to him and his sons until the rise of the Persian kingdom.
142Ch 36:21 This fulfilled the word of the LORD through Jeremiah and the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all the days of the desolation until 70 years were fulfilled.
142Ch 36:22 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The LORD put it into the mind of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and also [to put it] in writing:
142Ch 36:23 This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a temple at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you of His people may go up, and may the LORD his God be with him.
15
15Ezr 1:1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The LORD put it into the mind of King Cyrus to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and [to put it] in writing:
15Ezr 1:2 This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: "The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a house at Jerusalem in Judah.
15Ezr 1:3 Whoever is among His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 1:4 Let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem."
15Ezr 1:5 So the family leaders of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites-- everyone God had motivated-- prepared to go up and rebuild the LORD's house in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 1:6 All their neighbors supported them with silver articles, gold, goods, livestock, and valuables, in addition to all that was given as a freewill offering.
15Ezr 1:7 King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the LORD's house that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the house of his gods.
15Ezr 1:8 King Cyrus of Persia had them brought out under the supervision of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
15Ezr 1:9 This was the inventory: 30 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins, 29 silver knives,
15Ezr 1:10 30 gold bowls, 410 various silver bowls, and 1,000 other articles.
15Ezr 1:11 The gold and silver articles totaled 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought all of them when the exiles went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15Ezr 2:1 These now are the people of the province who came from those captive exiles King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had deported to Babylon. Each of them returned to his hometown Jerusalem and Judah.
15Ezr 2:2 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the Israelite men [included]:

15Ezr 2:46 Hagab's descendants, Shalmai's descendants, Hanan's descendants,
15Ezr 2:47 Giddel's descendants, Gahar's descendants, Reaiah's descendants,
15Ezr 2:48 Rezin's descendants, Nekoda's descendants, Gazzam's descendants,
15Ezr 2:49 Uzza's descendants, Paseah's descendants, Besai's descendants,

15Ezr 2:54 Neziah's descendants, and Hatipha's descendants.
15Ezr 2:55 The descendants of Solomon's servants [included]: Sotai's descendants, Hassophereth's descendants, Peruda's descendants,
15Ezr 2:56 Jaalah's descendants, Darkon's descendants, Giddel's descendants,
15Ezr 2:57 Shephatiah's descendants, Hattil's descendants, Pochereth-hazzebaim's descendants, and Ami's descendants.
15Ezr 2:58 All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants 392
15Ezr 2:59 The following are those who came from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer but were unable to prove that their families and ancestry were Israelite:
15Ezr 2:60 Delaiah's descendants, Tobiah's descendants, Nekoda's descendants 652
15Ezr 2:61 and from the descendants of the priests: the descendants of Habaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, the descendants of Barzillai-- who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
15Ezr 2:62 These searched for their entries in the genealogical records, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood.
15Ezr 2:63 The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
15Ezr 2:64 The whole combined assembly numbered 42,360
15Ezr 2:65 not including their 7,337 male and female slaves, and their 200 male and female singers.
15Ezr 2:66 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
15Ezr 2:67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
15Ezr 2:68 After they arrived at the LORD's house in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders gave freewill offerings for the house of God in order to have it rebuilt on its [original] site.
15Ezr 2:69 Based on what they could give, they gave 61,000 gold coins, 6,250 pounds of silver, and 100 priestly garments to the treasury for the project.
15Ezr 2:70 The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, and some of the people settled in their towns, and [the rest of] Israel [settled] in their towns.
15Ezr 3:1 By the seventh month, the Israelites had settled in their towns, and the people gathered together in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 3:2 Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brothers began to build the altar of Israel's God in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
15Ezr 3:3 They set up the altar on its foundation and offered burnt offerings for the morning and evening on it to the LORD even though they feared the surrounding peoples.
15Ezr 3:4 They celebrated the Festival of Booths as prescribed, and [offered] burnt offerings each day, based on the number specified by ordinance for each festival day.
15Ezr 3:5 After that, [they offered] the regular burnt offering and the offerings for the beginning of each monthand for all the LORD's appointed holy occasions, as well as the freewill offerings brought to the LORD.
15Ezr 3:6 On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, even though the foundation of the LORD's temple had not [yet] been laid.
15Ezr 3:7 They gave money to the stonecutters and artisans, and [gave] food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so they could bring cedar wood from Lebanon to Joppa by sea, according to the authorization [given] them by King Cyrus of Persia.
15Ezr 3:8 In the second month of the second year after they arrived at God's house in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers, including the priests, the Levites, and all who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity, began [to build]. They appointed the Levites who were 20 years old or more to supervise the work on the LORD's house.
15Ezr 3:9 Jeshua with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Judah and of Henadad, with their sons and brothers, the Levites, joined together to supervise those working on the house of God.
15Ezr 3:10 When the builders had laid the foundation of the LORD's temple, the priests, dressed in their robes and holding trumpets, and the Levites descended from Asaph, holding cymbals, took their positions to praise the LORD, as King David of Israel had instructed.
15Ezr 3:11 They sang with praise and thanksgiving to the LORD: "For He is good; His faithful love to Israel endures forever." Then all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD because the foundation of the LORD's house had been laid.
15Ezr 3:12 But many of the older priests, Levites, and family leaders, who had seen the first temple, wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this house, but many [others] shouted joyfully.
15Ezr 3:13 The people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouting from that of the weeping, because the people were shouting so loudly. And the sound was heard far away.
15Ezr 4:1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,
15Ezr 4:2 they approached Zerubbabel and the leaders of the families and said to them, "Let us build with you, for we also worship your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the time King Esar-haddon of Assyria brought us here."
15Ezr 4:3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders of Israel's families answered them, "You may have no part with us in building a house for our God, since we alone must build [it] for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us."
15Ezr 4:4 Then the people who were already in the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build.
15Ezr 4:5 They also bribed officials [to act] against them to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
15Ezr 4:6 At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus, the people who were already in the land wrote an accusation against the residents of Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 4:7 During the time of [King] Artaxerxes of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to King Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated.
15Ezr 4:8 Rehum the chief deputy and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes concerning Jerusalem as follows:
15Ezr 4:9 [From] Rehum the chief deputy, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues-- the judges and magistrates from Tripolis, Persia, Erech, Babylon, Susa (that is, the people of Elam),
15Ezr 4:10 and the rest of the peoples whom the great and illustrious Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the region west of the Euphrates River.
15Ezr 4:11 This is the text of the letter they sent to him: To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men from the region west of the Euphrates River:
15Ezr 4:12 Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came from you have returned to us at Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and evil city, finishing its walls, and repairing its foundations.
15Ezr 4:13 Let it now be known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, duty, or land tax, and the royal revenue will suffer.
15Ezr 4:14 Since we have taken an oath of loyalty to the king, and it is not right for us to witness his dishonor, we have sent to inform the king
15Ezr 4:15 that a search should be made in your fathers' record books. In these record books you will discover and verify that the city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces. There have been revolts in it since ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
15Ezr 4:16 We advise the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will not have any possession west of the Euphrates.
15Ezr 4:17 The king sent a reply to his chief deputy Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues living in Samaria and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates River: Greetings.
15Ezr 4:18 The letter you sent us has been translated and read in my presence.
15Ezr 4:19 I issued a decree and a search was conducted. It was discovered that this city has had uprisings against kings since ancient times, and there have been rebellions and revolts in it.
15Ezr 4:20 Powerful kings have also ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over the whole region, and tribute, duty, and land tax were paid to them.
15Ezr 4:21 Therefore, issue an order for these men to stop, so that this city will not be rebuilt until a [further] decree has been pronounced by me.
15Ezr 4:22 See that you not neglect this matter. Otherwise, the damage will increase and the royal interests will suffer.
15Ezr 4:23 As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes' letter was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they immediately went to the Jews in Jerusalem and forcibly stopped them.
15Ezr 4:24 Now the construction of God's house in Jerusalem had stopped and remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
15Ezr 5:1 But when the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them,
15Ezr 5:2 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began to rebuild God's house in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were with them, helping them.
15Ezr 5:3 At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues came to the Jews and asked, "Who gave you the order to rebuild this temple and finish this structure?"
15Ezr 5:4 They also asked them, "What are the names of the workers who are constructing this building?"
15Ezr 5:5 But God was watching over the Jewish elders. These men wouldn't stop them until a report was sent to Darius, so that they could receive written instructions about this [matter].
15Ezr 5:6 This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius.
15Ezr 5:7 They sent him a report, written as follows: To King Darius: All greetings.
15Ezr 5:8 Let it be known to the king that we went to the house of the great God in the province of Judah. It is being built with cut stones, and its beams are being set in the walls. This work is being done diligently and succeeding through the people's efforts.
15Ezr 5:9 So we questioned the elders and asked, "Who gave you the order to rebuild this temple and finish this structure?"
15Ezr 5:10 We also asked them for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
15Ezr 5:11 This is the reply they gave us: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
15Ezr 5:12 But since our fathers angered the God of heaven, He handed them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
15Ezr 5:13 However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, he issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
15Ezr 5:14 He also took from the temple in Babylon the gold and silver articles of God's house that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and carried [them] to the temple in Babylon. He released them from the temple in Babylon to a man named Sheshbazzar, the governor by the appointment of King Cyrus.
15Ezr 5:15 He told him, 'Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its [original] site.'
15Ezr 5:16 Then this same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of God's house in Jerusalem. It has been under construction from that time until now, yet it has not been completed.
15Ezr 5:17 So if it pleases the king, let a search of the royal archives in Babylon be conducted [to see] if it is true that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Let the king's decision regarding [this matter] be sent to us.
15Ezr 6:1 King Darius gave the order, and they searched in the library of Babylon in the archives.
15Ezr 6:2 But it was in the fortress of Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found with this record written on it:
15Ezr 6:3 In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, and let its [original] foundations be retained. Its height is to be 90 feet and its width 90 feet,
15Ezr 6:4 with three layers of cut stones and one of timber. The cost is to be paid from the royal treasury.
15Ezr 6:5 The gold and silver articles of God's house that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon must also be returned. They are to be brought to the temple in Jerusalem, where they belong, and put into the house of God.
15Ezr 6:6 Therefore, you must stay away from that place, Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials in the region.
15Ezr 6:7 Leave the construction of this house of God alone. Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its [original] site.
15Ezr 6:8 I hereby issue a decree concerning what you must do, so that the elders of the Jews can rebuild this house of God: The cost is to be paid in full to these men out of the royal revenues from the taxes of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that the [work] will not stop.
15Ezr 6:9 Whatever is needed-- young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem-- let it be given to them every day without fail,
15Ezr 6:10 so that they can offer sacrifices of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
15Ezr 6:11 I also issue a decree concerning any man who interferes with this directive: Let a beam be torn from his house and raised up; he will be impaled on it, and his house will be made into a garbage dump because of this [offense].
15Ezr 6:12 May the God who caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who dares to harm or interfere with this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree. Let it be carried out diligently.
15Ezr 6:13 Then Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues diligently carried out what King Darius had decreed.
15Ezr 6:14 So the Jewish elders continued successfully with the building under the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished the building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia.
15Ezr 6:15 This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15Ezr 6:16 Then the Israelites, including the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
15Ezr 6:17 For the dedication of God's house they offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs, as well as 12 male goats as a sin offering for all Israel-- one for each Israelite tribe.
15Ezr 6:18 They also appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their groups to the service of God in Jerusalem, according to what is written in the book of Moses.
15Ezr 6:19 The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
15Ezr 6:20 All of the priests and Levites were ceremonially clean, because they had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for themselves, their priestly brothers, and all the exiles.
15Ezr 6:21 The Israelites who had returned from exile ate [it], together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land in order to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 6:22 They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful, having changed the Assyrian king's attitude toward them, so that he supported them in the work on the house of the God of Israel.
15Ezr 7:1 After these events, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra-- Seraiah's son, Azariah's son, Hilkiah's son,
15Ezr 7:2 Shallum's son, Zadok's son, Ahitub's son,
15Ezr 7:3 Amariah's son, Azariah's son, Meraioth's son,
15Ezr 7:4 Zerahiah's son, Uzzi's son, Bukki's son,
15Ezr 7:5 Abishua's son, Phinehas's son, Eleazar's son, Aaron the chief priest's son
15Ezr 7:6 -- came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he requested because the hand of the LORD his God was on him.
15Ezr 7:7 Some of the Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants accompanied [him] to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15Ezr 7:8 Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, during the seventh year of the king.
15Ezr 7:9 He began the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month and arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. The gracious hand of his God was on him,
15Ezr 7:10 because Ezra had determined in his heart to study the law of the LORD, obey [it], and teach [its] statutes and ordinances in Israel.
15Ezr 7:11 This is the text of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and scribe, an expert in matters of the LORD's commandments and statutes for Israel:
15Ezr 7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, an expert in the law of the God of heaven: Greetings [to you].
15Ezr 7:13 I issue a decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including their priests and Levites, who want to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
15Ezr 7:14 You are sent by the king and his seven counselors to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your possession.
15Ezr 7:15 [You are] also to bring the silver and gold the king and his counselors have willingly given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15Ezr 7:16 and all the silver and gold you receive throughout the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offerings given by the people and the priests to the house of their God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:17 Then, you are to buy with this money as many bulls, rams, and lambs as needed, along with their grain and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar at the house of your God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:18 You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God.
15Ezr 7:19 You must deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles given to you for the service of the house of your God.
15Ezr 7:20 You may use the royal treasury to pay for anything else you have to supply [to meet] the needs of the house of your God.
15Ezr 7:21 I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers in the region west of the Euphrates River: Whatever Ezra the priest and expert in the law of the God of heaven asks of you must be provided promptly,
15Ezr 7:22 up to 7,500 pounds of silver, 500 bushels of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, 550 gallons of oil, and salt without limit.
15Ezr 7:23 Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven, so that wrath will not fall on the realm of the king and his sons.
15Ezr 7:24 Be advised that tribute, duty, and land tax must not be imposed on any priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or [other] servants of this house of God.
15Ezr 7:25 And you, Ezra, according to God's wisdom that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the region west of the Euphrates who know the laws of your God and to teach anyone who does not know [them].
15Ezr 7:26 Anyone who does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, let a fair judgment be executed against him, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
15Ezr 7:27 Praise the LORD God of our fathers, who has put it into the king's mind to glorify the house of the LORD in Jerusalem,
15Ezr 7:28 and who has shown favor to me before the king, his counselors, and all his powerful officers. So I took courage because I was strengthened by the LORD my God, and I gathered Israelite leaders to return with me.
15Ezr 8:1 These are the family leaders and the genealogical records of those who returned with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
15Ezr 8:2 Gershom, from Phinehas's descendants; Daniel, from Ithamar's descendants; Hattush, from David's descendants,
15Ezr 8:3 who was of Shecaniah's descendants; Zechariah, from Parosh's descendants, and 150 men with him who were registered by genealogy;
15Ezr 8:4 Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah from Pahath-moab's descendants, and 200 men with him;
15Ezr 8:5 Shecaniah son of Jahaziel from Zattu's descendants, and 300 men with him;
15Ezr 8:6 Ebed son of Jonathan from Adin's descendants, and 50 men with him;
15Ezr 8:7 Jeshaiah son of Athaliah from Elam's descendants, and 70 men with him;
15Ezr 8:8 Zebadiah son of Michael from Shephatiah's descendants, and 80 men with him;
15Ezr 8:9 Obadiah son of Jehiel from Joab's descendants, and 218 men with him;
15Ezr 8:10 Shelomith son of Josiphiah from Bani's descendants, and 160 men with him;
15Ezr 8:11 Zechariah son of Bebai from Bebai's descendants, and 28 men with him;
15Ezr 8:12 Johanan son of Hakkatan from Azgad's descendants, and 110 men with him;
15Ezr 8:13 these are the last ones, from Adonikam's descendants, and their names are: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and 60 men with them;
15Ezr 8:14 Uthai and Zaccur from Bigvai's descendants, and 70 men with them.
15Ezr 8:15 I gathered them at the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there for three days. I searched among the people and priests, but found no Levites there.
15Ezr 8:16 Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan.
15Ezr 8:17 I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for him and his brothers, the temple servants at Casiphia, that they should bring us ministers for the house of our God.
15Ezr 8:18 Since the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah-- a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli, a descendant of Levi son of Israel-- along with his sons and brothers, 18 men,
15Ezr 8:19 plus Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20 men.
15Ezr 8:20 There were also 220 of the temple servants, who had been appointed by David and the leaders for the work of the Levites. All were identified by name.
15Ezr 8:21 I proclaimed a fast by the Ahava River, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions.
15Ezr 8:22 [I did this] because I was ashamed to ask the king for infantry and cavalry to protect us from enemies during the journey, since we had told him, "The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek Him, but His great anger is against all who abandon Him."
15Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and He granted our request.
15Ezr 8:24 I selected 12 of the leading priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 of their brothers.
15Ezr 8:25 I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles-- the contribution for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites who were present had offered.
15Ezr 8:26 I weighed out to them 24 tons of silver, silver articles weighing 7,500 pounds, 7,500 pounds of gold,
15Ezr 8:27 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 gold coins, and two articles of fine gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold.
15Ezr 8:28 Then I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
15Ezr 8:29 Guard [them] carefully until you weigh [them] out in the chambers of the LORD's house before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the Israelite families in Jerusalem."
15Ezr 8:30 So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the articles that had been weighed out, to bring [them] to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 8:31 We set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth [day] of the first month to go to Jerusalem. We were strengthened by our God, and He protected us from the power of the enemy and from ambush along the way.
15Ezr 8:32 So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
15Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the articles were weighed out in the house of our God into the care of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him. The Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui were also with them.
15Ezr 8:34 Everything was [verified] by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
15Ezr 8:35 The exiles who had returned from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs, along with 12 male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering for the LORD.
15Ezr 8:36 They also delivered the king's edicts to the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates, so that they would support the people and the house of God.
15Ezr 9:1 After these things had been done, the leaders approached me and said: "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the surrounding peoples whose detestable practices are like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
15Ezr 9:2 Indeed, they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy people has become mixed with the surrounding peoples. The leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!"
15Ezr 9:3 When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and robe, pulled out some of the hair from my head and beard, and sat down devastated.
15Ezr 9:4 Everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat devastated until the evening offering.
15Ezr 9:5 At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation, with my tunic and robe torn. Then I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God.
15Ezr 9:6 And I said: My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face toward You, my God, because our iniquities are higher than [our] heads and our guilt is as high as the heavens.
15Ezr 9:7 Our guilt has been terrible from the days of our fathers until the present. Because of our iniquities we have been handed over, along with our kings and priests, to the surrounding kings, and to the sword, captivity, plundering, and open shame, as it is today.
15Ezr 9:8 But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from the LORD our God to preserve a remnant for us and give us a stake in His holy place. Even in our slavery, God has given us new life and light to our eyes.
15Ezr 9:9 Though we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our slavery. He has extended grace to us in the presence of the Persian kings, giving us new life, so that we can rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 9:10 Now, our God, what can we say in light of this? For we have abandoned the commandments
15Ezr 9:11 You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: "The land you are entering to possess is an impure land. The surrounding peoples have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness by their impurity and detestable practices.
15Ezr 9:12 So do not give your daughters to their sons in marriage or take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you will be strong, eat the good things of the land, and leave [it] as an inheritance to your sons forever."
15Ezr 9:13 After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and terrible guilt-- though You, our God, have punished [us] less than our sins [deserve] and have allowed us to survive--
15Ezr 9:14 should we break Your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who commit these detestable practices? Wouldn't You become [so] angry with us that You would destroy us, leaving no survivors?
15Ezr 9:15 LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we survive as a remnant today. Here we are before You with our guilt, though no one can stand in Your presence because of this.
15Ezr 10:1 While Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and falling facedown before the house of God, an extremely large assembly of Israelite men, women, and children gathered around him. The people also wept bitterly.
15Ezr 10:2 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, an Elamite, responded to Ezra: "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the surrounding peoples, but there is still hope for Israel in spite of this.
15Ezr 10:3 Let us therefore make a covenant before our God to send away all the [foreign] wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law.
15Ezr 10:4 Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we support you. Be strong and take action!"
15Ezr 10:5 Then Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said; so they took the oath.
15Ezr 10:6 Ezra then went from the house of God, walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, where he spent the night. He did not eat food or drink water, because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
15Ezr 10:7 They circulated a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem.
15Ezr 10:8 Whoever did not come within three days would forfeit all his possessions, according to the decision of the leaders and elders, and would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
15Ezr 10:9 So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. On the twentieth [day] of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square at the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
15Ezr 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.
15Ezr 10:11 Therefore, make a confession to the LORD God of your fathers and do His will. Separate yourselves from the surrounding peoples and [your] foreign wives."
15Ezr 10:12 Then all the assembly responded with a loud voice: "Yes, we will do as you say!
15Ezr 10:13 But there are many people, and it is the rainy season. We don't have the stamina to stay out in the open. This isn't something that can be done in a day or two, for we have rebelled terribly in this matter.
15Ezr 10:14 Let our leaders represent the entire assembly. Then let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each town, in order to avert the fierce anger of our God concerning this matter."
15Ezr 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.
15Ezr 10:16 The exiles did what had been proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family leaders, all [identified] by name, to represent their ancestral houses. They convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter,
15Ezr 10:17 and by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
15Ezr 10:18 [The following] were found to have married foreign women from the descendants of the priests: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
15Ezr 10:19 They pledged to send their wives away, and being guilty, [they offered] a ram from the flock for their guilt;
15Ezr 10:20 Hanani and Zebadiah from Immer's descendants;
15Ezr 10:21 Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah from Harim's descendants;
15Ezr 10:22 Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah from Pashhur's descendants.
15Ezr 10:23 The Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
15Ezr 10:24 The singers: Eliashib. The gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
15Ezr 10:25 The Israelites: Parosh's descendants: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;
15Ezr 10:26 Elam's descendants: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah;
15Ezr 10:27 Zattu's descendants: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;
15Ezr 10:28 Bebai's descendants: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;
15Ezr 10:29 Bani's descendants: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth;
15Ezr 10:30 Pahath-moab's descendants: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;
15Ezr 10:31 Harim's descendants: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
15Ezr 10:32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;
15Ezr 10:33 Hashum's descendants: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;
15Ezr 10:34 Bani's descendants: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
15Ezr 10:35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
15Ezr 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
15Ezr 10:37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu,
15Ezr 10:38 Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
15Ezr 10:39 Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
15Ezr 10:40 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
15Ezr 10:41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
15Ezr 10:42 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
15Ezr 10:43 Nebo's descendants: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
15Ezr 10:44 All of these had married foreign women, and some of the wives had borne children.

16Neh 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year, when I was in the fortress city of Susa,
16Neh 1:2 Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah, and I questioned them about Jerusalem and the Jewish remnant that had returned from exile.
16Neh 1:3 They said to me, "The survivors in the province, who returned from the exile, are in great trouble and disgrace. Jerusalem's wall has been broken down, and its gates have been burned down."
16Neh 1:4 When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
16Neh 1:5 I said, LORD God of heaven, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commands,
16Neh 1:6 let Your eyes be open and Your ears be attentive to hear Your servant's prayer that I now pray to You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we have committed against You. Both I and my father's house have sinned.
16Neh 1:7 We have acted corruptly toward You and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances You gave Your servant Moses.
16Neh 1:8 Please remember what You commanded Your servant Moses: "[If] you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples.
16Neh 1:9 But if you return to Me and carefully observe My commands, even though your exiles were banished to the ends of the earth, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I chose to have My name dwell."
16Neh 1:10 They are Your servants and Your people. You redeemed [them] by Your great power and strong hand.
16Neh 1:11 Please, Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to that of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success today, and have compassion on him in the presence of this man. [At the time,] I was the king's cupbearer.
16Neh 2:1 During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence,
16Neh 2:2 so the king said to me, "Why are you sad, when you aren't sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart." I was overwhelmed with fear
16Neh 2:3 and replied to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
16Neh 2:4 Then the king asked me, "What is your request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven
16Neh 2:5 and answered the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I may rebuild it."
16Neh 2:6 The king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you return?" So I gave him a definite time, and it pleased the king to send me.
16Neh 2:7 I also said to the king: "If it pleases the king, let me have letters [written] to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that they will grant me [safe] passage until I reach Judah.
16Neh 2:8 And [let me have] a letter [written] to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple's fortress, the city wall, and the home where I will live." The king granted my [requests], for I was graciously strengthened by my God.
16Neh 2:9 I went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent officers of the infantry and cavalry with me.
16Neh 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites, they were greatly displeased.
16Neh 2:11 After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,
16Neh 2:12 I got up at night and [took] a few men with me. I didn't tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the one I was riding.
16Neh 2:13 I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent's Well and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.
16Neh 2:14 I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but farther down it became too narrow for my animal to go through.
16Neh 2:15 So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate and returned.
16Neh 2:16 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work.
16Neh 2:17 So I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned down. Come, let's rebuild Jerusalem's wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace."
16Neh 2:18 I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me, and what the king had said to me. They said, "Let's start rebuilding," and they were encouraged to [do] this good work.
16Neh 2:19 When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard [about this], they mocked and despised us, and said, "What is this you're doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"
16Neh 2:20 I gave them this reply, "The God of heaven is the One who will grant us success. We, His servants, will start building, but you have no share, right, or historic claim in Jerusalem."
16Neh 3:1 Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began rebuilding the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and installed its doors. [After building the wall] to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel, they dedicated it.
16Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built next to Eliashib, and next to them Zaccur son of Imri built.
16Neh 3:3 The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They built it with beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16Neh 3:4 Next to them Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, made repairs. Beside them Meshullam son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok son of Baana made repairs.
16Neh 3:5 Beside them the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not lift a finger to help their supervisors.
16Neh 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate. They built it with beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16Neh 3:7 Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who were under the authority of the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River.
16Neh 3:8 After him Uzziel son of Harhaiah, the goldsmith, made repairs, and next to him Hananiah son of the perfumer made repairs. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16Neh 3:9 Next to them Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler over half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs.
16Neh 3:10 After them Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house. Next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
16Neh 3:11 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab made repairs to another section, as well as to the Tower of the Ovens.
16Neh 3:12 Beside him Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler over half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs-- he and his daughters.
16Neh 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They rebuilt it and installed its doors, bolts, and bars, and repaired 500 yards of the wall to the Dung Gate.
16Neh 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler over the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired the Dung Gate. He rebuilt it and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
16Neh 3:15 Shallun son of Col-hozeh, ruler over the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it and roofed it. Then he installed its doors, bolts, and bars. He also made repairs to the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king's garden, as far as the stairs that descend from the city of David.
16Neh 3:16 After him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler over half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs up to [a point] opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Warriors.
16Neh 3:17 Next to him the Levites made repairs [under] Rehum son of Bani. Beside him Hashabiah, ruler over half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district.
16Neh 3:18 After him their fellow [Levites] made repairs [under] Binnui son of Henadad, ruler over half the district of Keilah.
16Neh 3:19 Next to him Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler over Mizpah, made repairs to another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle.
16Neh 3:20 After him Baruch son of Zabbai diligently repaired another section, from the Angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16Neh 3:21 Beside him Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, made repairs to another section, from the door of Eliashib's house to the end of his house.
16Neh 3:22 And next to him the priests from the surrounding area made repairs.
16Neh 3:23 After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. Beside them Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house.
16Neh 3:24 After him Binnui son of Henadad made repairs to another section, from the house of Azariah to the Angle and the corner.
16Neh 3:25 Palal son of Uzai [made repairs] opposite the Angle and tower that juts out from the upper palace of the king, by the courtyard of the guard. Beside him Pedaiah son of Parosh,
16Neh 3:26 and the temple servants living on Ophel [made repairs] opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the tower that juts out.
16Neh 3:27 Next to him the Tekoites made repairs to another section from [a point] opposite the great tower that juts out, as far as the wall of Ophel.
16Neh 3:28 Each of the priests made repairs above the Horse Gate, each opposite his own house.
16Neh 3:29 After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. And beside him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, guard of the East Gate, made repairs.
16Neh 3:30 Next to him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph made repairs to another section. After them Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his room.
16Neh 3:31 Next to him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs to the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the upper room of the corner.
16Neh 3:32 The goldsmiths and merchants made repairs between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate.
16Neh 4:1  When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious. He mocked the Jews
16Neh 4:2 before his colleagues and the powerful men of Samaria, and said, "What are these pathetic Jews doing? Can they restore [it] by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they ever finish it? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?"
16Neh 4:3 Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, "Indeed, even if a fox climbed up what they are building, he would break down their stone wall!"
16Neh 4:4 Listen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.
16Neh 4:5 Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from Your sight, because they have provoked the builders.
16Neh 4:6 So we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its [height], for the people had the will to keep working.
16Neh 4:7  When Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they became furious.
16Neh 4:8 They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion.
16Neh 4:9 So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.
16Neh 4:10 In Judah, it was said: The strength of the laborer fails, since there is so much rubble. We will never be able to rebuild the wall.
16Neh 4:11 And our enemies said, "They won't know or see anything until we're among them and can kill them and stop the work."
16Neh 4:12 When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again, "Everywhere you turn, [they] attack us."
16Neh 4:13 So I stationed [people] behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
16Neh 4:14 After I made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord, and fight for your countrymen, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes."
16Neh 4:15 When our enemies realized that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall.
16Neh 4:16 From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers supported all the people of Judah,
16Neh 4:17 who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried the loads worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.
16Neh 4:18 Each of the builders had his sword strapped around his waist while he was building, and the trumpeter was beside me.
16Neh 4:19 Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: "The work is enormous and spread out, and we are separated far from one another along the wall.
16Neh 4:20 Wherever you hear the trumpet sound, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!"
16Neh 4:21 So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out.
16Neh 4:22 At that time, I also said to the people, "Let everyone and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day."
16Neh 4:23 And I, my brothers, my men, and the guards with me never took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing.
16Neh 5:1 There was a widespread outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen.
16Neh 5:2 Some were saying, "We, our sons, and our daughters are numerous. Let us get grain so that we can eat and live."
16Neh 5:3 Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine."
16Neh 5:4 Still others were saying, "We have borrowed money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.
16Neh 5:5 We and our children are [just] like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless because our fields and vineyards belong to others."
16Neh 5:6 I became extremely angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
16Neh 5:7 After seriously considering the matter, I accused the nobles and officials, saying to them, "Each of you is charging his countrymen interest." So I called a large assembly against them
16Neh 5:8 and said, "We have done our best to buy back our Jewish countrymen who were sold to foreigners, but now you sell your own countrymen, and we have to buy them back." They remained silent and could not say a word.
16Neh 5:9 Then I said, "What you are doing isn't right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God [and not invite] the reproach of our foreign enemies?
16Neh 5:10 Even I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop charging this interest.
16Neh 5:11 Return their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses to them immediately, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil that you have been assessing them."
16Neh 5:12 They responded: "We will return [these things] and require nothing more from them. We will do as you say." So I summoned the priests and made everyone take an oath to do this.
16Neh 5:13 I also shook the folds of my robe and said, "May God likewise shake from his house and property everyone who doesn't keep this promise. May he be shaken out and have nothing!" The whole assembly said, " Amen," and they praised the LORD. Then the people did as they had promised.
16Neh 5:14 Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah-- from the twentieth year until his thirty-second year, 12 years-- I and my associates never ate from the food allotted to the governor.
16Neh 5:15 The governors who preceded me had heavily burdened the people, taking food and wine from them, as well as a pound of silver. Their subordinates also oppressed the people, but I didn't do this, because of the fear of God.
16Neh 5:16 Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall, and all my subordinates were gathered there for the work. We didn't buy any land.
16Neh 5:17 There were 150 Jews and officials, as well as guests from the surrounding nations at my table.
16Neh 5:18 Each day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me. An abundance of all kinds of wine was [provided] every 10 days. But I didn't demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy.
16Neh 5:19 Remember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people.
16Neh 6:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gap was left in it-- though at that time I had not installed the doors in the gates--
16Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message: "Come, let's meet together in the villages of the Ono Valley." But they were planning to harm me.
16Neh 6:3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?"
16Neh 6:4 Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply.
16Neh 6:5 Sanballat sent me this same message a fifth time by his aide, who had an open letter in his hand.
16Neh 6:6 In it was written: It is reported among the nations-- and Geshem agrees-- that you and the Jews plan to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king
16Neh 6:7 and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: "There is a king in Judah." These rumors will be heard by the king. So come, let's confer together.
16Neh 6:8 Then I replied to him, "There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind."
16Neh 6:9 For they were all trying to intimidate us, saying, "They will become discouraged in the work, and it will never be finished." But now, [my God,] strengthen me.
16Neh 6:10 I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted [to his house]. He said: Let us meet at the house of God inside the temple. Let us shut the temple doors because they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you tonight!
16Neh 6:11 But I said, "Should a man like me run away? How can I enter the temple and live? I will not go."
16Neh 6:12 I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16Neh 6:13 He was hired, so that I would be intimidated, do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me.
16Neh 6:14 My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who wanted to intimidate me.
16Neh 6:15 The wall was completed in 52 days, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Ellul.
16Neh 6:16 When all our enemies heard this, all the surrounding nations were intimidated and lost their confidence, for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God.
16Neh 6:17 During those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's [letters] came to them.
16Neh 6:18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
16Neh 6:19 These nobles kept mentioning Tobiah's good deeds to me, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16Neh 7:1 When the wall had been rebuilt and I had the doors installed, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed.
16Neh 7:2 Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most.
16Neh 7:3 I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot, and let the doors be shut and securely fastened while the guards are on duty. Station the citizens of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their homes."
16Neh 7:4 The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and no houses had been built yet.
16Neh 7:5 Then my God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be registered by genealogy. I found the genealogical record of those who came back first, and I found [the following] written in it:
16Neh 7:6 These are the people of the province who went up from among the captive exiles deported by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Each of them returned to his own town in Jerusalem and Judah.
16Neh 7:7 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the Israelite men [included]:

16Neh 7:48 Lebana's descendants, Hagaba's descendants, Shalmai's descendants,
16Neh 7:49 Hanan's descendants, Giddel's descendants, Gahar's descendants,

16Neh 7:58 Jaala's descendants, Darkon's descendants, Giddel's descendants,
16Neh 7:59 Shephatiah's descendants, Hattil's descendants, Pochereth-hazzebaim's descendants, Amon's descendants.
16Neh 7:60 All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants 392
16Neh 7:61 The following are those who came from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but were unable to prove that their families and ancestry were Israelite:
16Neh 7:62 Delaiah's descendants, Tobiah's descendants, and Nekoda's descendants 642
16Neh 7:63 and from the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai-- who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.
16Neh 7:64 These searched for their entries in the genealogical records, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood.
16Neh 7:65 The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
16Neh 7:66 The whole combined assembly numbered 42,360
16Neh 7:67 not including their 7,337 male and female slaves, as well as their 245 male and female singers.
16Neh 7:68 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
16Neh 7:69 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
16Neh 7:70 Some of the family leaders gave to the project. The governor gave 1,000 gold drachmas, 50 bowls, and 530 priestly garments to the treasury.
16Neh 7:71 Some of the family leaders gave 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas to the treasury for the project.
16Neh 7:72 The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priestly garments.
16Neh 7:73 So the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, temple singers, some of the people, temple servants, and all Israel settled in their towns.
16Neh 8:1 When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, all the people gathered together at the square in front of the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses that the LORD had given Israel.
16Neh 8:2 On the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding.
16Neh 8:3 While he was facing the square in front of the Water Gate, he read out of it from daybreak until noon before the men, the women, and those who could understand. All the people listened attentively to the book of the law.
16Neh 8:4 Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform made for this purpose. Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah stood beside him on his right; to his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
16Neh 8:5 Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people, since he was elevated above everyone. As he opened it, all the people stood up.
16Neh 8:6 Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and with their hands uplifted all the people said, " Amen, Amen!" Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
16Neh 8:7 Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, who were Levites, explained the law to the people as they stood in their places.
16Neh 8:8 They read the book of the law of God, translating and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was read.
16Neh 8:9 Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all of them, "This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the law.
16Neh 8:10 Then he said to them, "Go and eat what is rich, drink what is sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing prepared, since today is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, because your strength [comes from] rejoicing in the LORD."
16Neh 8:11 And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, "Be still, since today is holy. Do not grieve."
16Neh 8:12 Then all the people began to eat and drink, send portions, and have a great celebration, because they had understood the words that were explained to them.
16Neh 8:13 On the second day, the family leaders of all the people, along with the priests and Levites, assembled before Ezra the scribe to study the words of the law.
16Neh 8:14 They found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should dwell in booths during the festival of the seventh month.
16Neh 8:15 So they proclaimed and spread this news throughout all their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the hill country and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and [other] leafy trees to make booths, just as it is written."
16Neh 8:16 The people went out, brought back [branches], and made booths for themselves on each of their rooftops, and courtyards, the court of the house of God, the square by the Water Gate, and the square by the Gate of Ephraim.
16Neh 8:17 The whole community that had returned from exile made booths and lived in them. They had not celebrated like this from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day. And there was tremendous joy.
16Neh 8:18 Ezra read out of the book of the law of God every day, from the first day to the last. The Israelites celebrated the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day there was an assembly, according to the ordinance.
16Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites assembled; they were fasting, [wearing] sackcloth, [and had put] dust on their heads.
16Neh 9:2 Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners, and they stood and confessed their sins and the guilt of their fathers.
16Neh 9:3 While they stood in their places, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day and [spent] another fourth of the day in confession and worship of the LORD their God.
16Neh 9:4 Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the raised platform [built] for the Levites and cried out loudly to the LORD their God.
16Neh 9:5 Then the Levites-- Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah-- said: Stand up. Bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting. Praise Your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
16Neh 9:6 You alone are the LORD. You created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly host worships You.
16Neh 9:7 You are the LORD God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and changed his name to Abraham.
16Neh 9:8 You found his heart faithful in Your sight, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites-- to give it to his descendants. You have kept Your promise, for You are righteous.
16Neh 9:9 You saw the oppression of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16Neh 9:10 You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the people of his land, for You knew how arrogantly they treated our ancestors. You made a name for Yourself that endures to this day.
16Neh 9:11 You divided the sea before them, and they crossed through it on dry ground. You hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into churning waters.
16Neh 9:12 You led them with a pillar of cloud by day, and with a pillar of fire by night, to illuminate the way they should go.
16Neh 9:13 You came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them impartial ordinances, reliable instructions, and good decrees and commandments.
16Neh 9:14 You revealed Your holy Sabbath to them, and gave them commandments, statutes, and a law through Your servant Moses.
16Neh 9:15 You provided bread from heaven for their hunger; You brought them water from the rock for their thirst. You told them to go in and possess the land You had sworn to give them.
16Neh 9:16 But our ancestors acted arrogantly; they became stiff-necked and did not listen to Your commands.
16Neh 9:17 They refused to listen and did not remember Your wonders You performed among them. They became stiff-necked and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in faithful love, and You did not abandon them.
16Neh 9:18 Even after they had cast an image of a calf for themselves and said, "This is your God who brought you out of Egypt," and they had committed terrible blasphemies,
16Neh 9:19 You did not abandon them in the wilderness because of Your great compassion. During the day the pillar of cloud never turned away from them, guiding them on their journey. And during the night the pillar of fire illuminated the way they should go.
16Neh 9:20 You sent Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water for their thirst.
16Neh 9:21 You provided for them in the wilderness 40 years and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
16Neh 9:22 You gave them kingdoms and peoples and assigned them to be a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and of the land of Og king of Bashan.
16Neh 9:23 You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven and brought them to the land You told their ancestors to go in and take possession [of it].
16Neh 9:24 So their descendants went in and possessed the land: You subdued the Canaanites who inhabited the land before them and handed their kings and the surrounding peoples over to them, to do as they pleased with them.
16Neh 9:25 They captured fortified cities and fertile land and took possession of well-supplied houses, rock-hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate, were filled, became prosperous, and delighted in Your great goodness.
16Neh 9:26 But they were disobedient and rebelled against You. They flung Your law behind their backs and killed Your prophets who warned them to turn them back to You. They committed terrible blasphemies.
16Neh 9:27 So You handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. In their time of distress, they cried out to You, and You heard from heaven. In Your abundant compassion You gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the power of their enemies.
16Neh 9:28 But as soon as they had relief, they again did what was evil in Your sight. So You abandoned them to the power of their enemies, who dominated them. When they cried out to You again, You heard from heaven and rescued them many times in Your compassion.
16Neh 9:29 You warned them to turn back to Your law, but they acted arrogantly and would not obey Your commandments. They sinned against Your ordinances, by which a person will live if he does them. They stubbornly resisted, stiffened their necks, and would not obey.
16Neh 9:30 You were patient with them for many years, and Your Spirit warned them through Your prophets, but they would not listen. Therefore, You handed them over to the surrounding peoples.
16Neh 9:31 However, in Your abundant compassion, You did not destroy them or abandon them, for You are a gracious and compassionate God.
16Neh 9:32 So now, our God-- the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant-- do not view lightly all the hardships that have afflicted us, our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all Your people, from the days of the Assyrian kings until today.
16Neh 9:33 You are righteous concerning all that has come on us, because You have acted faithfully, while we have acted wickedly.
16Neh 9:34 Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not obey Your law or listen to Your commandments and warnings You gave them.
16Neh 9:35 When they were in their kingdom, with Your abundant goodness You gave them, and in the spacious and fertile land You set before them, they would not serve You or turn from their wicked ways.
16Neh 9:36 Here we are today, slaves in the land You gave our ancestors so that they could enjoy its fruit and its goodness. Here we are-- slaves in it!
16Neh 9:37 Its abundant harvest goes to the kings You have set over us, because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please. We are in great distress.
16Neh 9:38  In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement in writing on a sealed document [containing the names of] our leaders, Levites, and priests.
16Neh 10:1 Those whose seals were [on the document] were: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,
16Neh 10:2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
16Neh 10:3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

16Neh 10:9 The Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,
16Neh 10:10 and their brothers Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
16Neh 10:11 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
16Neh 10:12 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
16Neh 10:13 Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
16Neh 10:14 The leaders of the people were: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
16Neh 10:15 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16Neh 10:16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
16Neh 10:17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
16Neh 10:18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
16Neh 10:19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
16Neh 10:20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
16Neh 10:21 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
16Neh 10:22 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
16Neh 10:23 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
16Neh 10:24 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
16Neh 10:25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
16Neh 10:26 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
16Neh 10:27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
16Neh 10:28 The rest of the people-- the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants, along with their wives, sons, and daughters, everyone who is able to understand and who has separated themselves from the surrounding peoples to [obey] the law of God--
16Neh 10:29 join with their noble brothers and commit themselves with a sworn oath to follow the law of God given through God's servant Moses and to carefully obey all the commands, ordinances, and statutes of the LORD our Lord.
16Neh 10:30 We will not give our daughters in marriage to the surrounding peoples and will not take their daughters as wives for our sons.
16Neh 10:31 When the surrounding peoples bring merchandise or any kind of grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or a holy day. We will also leave [the land] uncultivated in the seventh year and will cancel every debt.
16Neh 10:32 We will impose [the following] commandments on ourselves: To give an eighth of an ounce of silver yearly for the service of the house of our God:
16Neh 10:33 the bread displayed before the LORD,the daily grain offering, the regular burnt offering, the Sabbath and New Moon offerings, the appointed festivals, the holy things, the sin offerings to atone for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
16Neh 10:34 We have cast lots among the priests, Levites, and people for the donation of wood by our ancestral houses at the appointed times each year. They are to bring [the wood] to our God's house to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law.
16Neh 10:35 [We will] bring the firstfruits of our land and of every fruit tree to the LORD's house year by year.
16Neh 10:36 [We will also bring] the firstborn of our sons and our livestock, as prescribed by the law, and will bring the firstborn of our herds and flocks to the house of our God, to the priests who serve in our God's house.
16Neh 10:37 We will bring [a loaf] from our first batch of dough to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God. We will also bring the firstfruits of our [grain] offerings, of every fruit tree, and of the new wine and oil. A tenth of our land's [produce] from our lands belongs to the Levites, for the Levites are to collect the one-tenth offering in all our agricultural towns.
16Neh 10:38 A priest of Aaronic descent must accompany the Levites when they collect the tenth, and the Levites must take a tenth of this offering to the storerooms of the treasury in the house of our God.
16Neh 10:39 For the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of grain, new wine, and oil to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept and where the priests, gatekeepers, and singers serve. We will not neglect the house of our God.
16Neh 11:1 Now the leaders of the people stayed in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots for one out of ten to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine-tenths remained in their towns.
16Neh 11:2 The people praised all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
16Neh 11:3 These are the heads of the province who stayed in Jerusalem (but in the villages of Judah each lived on his own property in their towns-- the Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon's servants--
16Neh 11:4 while some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin settled in Jerusalem): Judah's descendants: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of Perez's descendants;
16Neh 11:5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, a descendant of the Shilonite.

16Neh 11:16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who supervised the work outside the house of God;
16Neh 11:17 Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, the leader who began the thanksgiving in prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his relatives; and Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun.
16Neh 11:18 All the Levites in the holy city: 284.
16Neh 11:19 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their relatives, who guarded the gates: 172.
16Neh 11:20 The rest of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were in all the villages of Judah, each on his own inherited property.
16Neh 11:21 The temple servants lived on Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa supervised the temple servants.
16Neh 11:22 The leader of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the descendants of Asaph, who were singers for the service of God's house.
16Neh 11:23 For there was a command of the king regarding them, and an ordinance regulating the singers' daily tasks.
16Neh 11:24 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's agent in every matter concerning the people.
16Neh 11:25 As for the farming settlements with their fields: Some of Judah's descendants lived in Kiriath-arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, and Jekabzeel and its villages,
16Neh 11:26 in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-pelet,
16Neh 11:27 Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba and its villages;
16Neh 11:28 in Ziklag and Meconah and its villages,
16Neh 11:29 in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, and
16Neh 11:30 Zanoah and Adullam with their villages; in Lachish with its fields and Azekah and its villages. So they settled from Beer-sheba to the Valley of Hinnom.

16Neh 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
16Neh 11:35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of the craftsmen.
16Neh 11:36 Some of the Judean divisions of Levites were in Benjamin.
16Neh 12:1 These are the priests and Levites who went up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16Neh 12:2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16Neh 12:3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
16Neh 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
16Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16Neh 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their relatives in the days of Jeshua.
16Neh 12:8 The Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah-- he and his relatives were in charge of the praise songs.
16Neh 12:9 Bakbukiah, Unni, and their relatives [stood] opposite them in the services.
16Neh 12:10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,
16Neh 12:11 Joiada fathered Jonathan, and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.
16Neh 12:12 In the days of Joiakim, the leaders of the priestly families were: Meraiah of Seraiah, Hananiah of Jeremiah,
16Neh 12:13 Meshullam of Ezra, Jehohanan of Amariah,
16Neh 12:14 Jonathan of Malluchi, Joseph of Shebaniah,
16Neh 12:15 Adna of Harim, Helkai of Meraioth,
16Neh 12:16 Zechariah of Iddo, Meshullam of Ginnethon,
16Neh 12:17 Zichri of Abijah, Piltai of Moadiah, of Miniamin,
16Neh 12:18 Shammua of Bilgah, Jehonathan of Shemaiah,
16Neh 12:19 Mattenai of Joiarib, Uzzi of Jedaiah,
16Neh 12:20 Kallai of Sallai, Eber of Amok,
16Neh 12:21 Hashabiah of Hilkiah, and Nethanel of Jedaiah.
16Neh 12:22 In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the leaders of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded while Darius the Persian ruled.
16Neh 12:23 Levi's descendants, the leaders of families, were recorded in the Book of the Historical Records during the days of Johanan son of Eliashib.
16Neh 12:24 The leaders of the Levites-- Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their relatives opposite them-- gave praise and thanks, division by division, as David the man of God had prescribed.
16Neh 12:25 [This included] Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
16Neh 12:26 These [served] in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.
16Neh 12:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sent for the Levites wherever they lived and brought them to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
16Neh 12:28 The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
16Neh 12:29 from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
16Neh 12:30 After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
16Neh 12:31 Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large processions that gave thanks. One went to the right on the wall, toward the Dung Gate.
16Neh 12:32 Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed:
16Neh 12:33 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.
16Neh 12:35 Some of the priests' sons had trumpets: Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,
16Neh 12:36 and his relatives: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe went in front of them.
16Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they climbed the steps of the city of David on the ascent of the wall [and went] above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
16Neh 12:38 The second thanksgiving procession went to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
16Neh 12:39 above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Old Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
16Neh 12:40 The two thanksgiving processions stood in the house of God. So [did] I and half of the officials accompanying me, as well as
16Neh 12:41 the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
16Neh 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as the leader.
16Neh 12:43 On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy. The women and children also celebrated, and Jerusalem's rejoicing was heard far away.
16Neh 12:44 On that same day men were placed in charge of the rooms [that housed] the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tenths. The legally required portions for the priests and Levites were gathered from the village fields, because Judah was grateful to the priests and Levites who were serving.
16Neh 12:45 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed.
16Neh 12:46 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16Neh 12:47 So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron.
16Neh 13:1 At that time the book of Moses was read publicly to the people. The command was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
16Neh 13:2 because they did not meet the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they hired Balaam against them to curse them, but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16Neh 13:3 When they heard the law, they separated all those of mixed descent from Israel.
16Neh 13:4 Now before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was a relative of Tobiah
16Neh 13:5 and had prepared a large room for him where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, and the tenths of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests.
16Neh 13:6 While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his [reign]. It was only later that I asked the king for a leave of absence
16Neh 13:7 so I could return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God's house.
16Neh 13:8 I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah's household possessions out of the room.
16Neh 13:9 I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored there, along with the grain offering and frankincense.
16Neh 13:10 I also found out that because the portions for the Levites had not been given, each of the Levites and the singers performing the service had gone back to his own field.
16Neh 13:11 Therefore, I rebuked the officials, saying, "Why has the house of God been neglected?" I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts.
16Neh 13:12 Then all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storehouses.
16Neh 13:13 I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy. They were responsible for the distribution to their colleagues.
16Neh 13:14 Remember me for this, my God, and don't erase the good deeds I have done for the house of my God and for its services.
16Neh 13:15 At that time I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in stores of grain and loading [them] on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned [them] against selling food on that day.
16Neh 13:16 The Tyrians living there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
16Neh 13:17 I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them: "What is this evil you are doing-- profaning the Sabbath day?
16Neh 13:18 Didn't your ancestors do the same, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling [His] anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!"
16Neh 13:19 When shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem just before the Sabbath, I gave orders that the gates be closed and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my men at the gates, so that no goods could enter during the Sabbath day.
16Neh 13:20 Once or twice the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,
16Neh 13:21 but I warned them, "Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I'll use force against you." After that they did not come again on the Sabbath.
16Neh 13:22 Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and look on me with compassion in keeping with Your abundant, faithful love.
16Neh 13:23 In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
16Neh 13:24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of one of the other peoples but could not speak Hebrew.
16Neh 13:25 I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair. I forced them to take an oath before God and said: "You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or yourselves!
16Neh 13:26 Didn't King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin.
16Neh 13:27 Why then should we hear about you doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"
16Neh 13:28 Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me.
16Neh 13:29 Remember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
16Neh 13:30 So I purified them from everything foreign and assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.
16Neh 13:31 I also arranged for the donation of wood at the appointed times and for the firstfruits. Remember me, my God, with favor.

17Est 1:1 These events took place during the days of Ahasuerus,who ruled 127 provinces from India to Cush.
17Est 1:2 In those days King Ahasuerus reigned from his royal throne in the fortress at Susa.
17Est 1:3 He held a feast in the third year of his reign for all his officials and staff, the army of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the officials from the provinces.
17Est 1:4 He displayed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness for a total of 180 days.
17Est 1:5 At the end of this time, the king held a week-long banquet in the garden courtyard of the royal palace for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were present in the fortress of Susa.
17Est 1:6 White and violet linen hangings were fastened with fine white and purple linen cords to silver rods on marble columns. Gold and silver couches [were arranged] on a mosaic pavement of red feldspar, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
17Est 1:7 Beverages were served in an array of gold goblets, each with a different design. Royal wine flowed freely, according to the king's bounty
17Est 1:8 and no restraint was placed on the drinking. The king had ordered every wine steward in his household to serve as much as each person wanted.
17Est 1:9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women of King Ahasuerus' palace.
17Est 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was feeling good from the wine, Ahasuerus commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who personally served him,
17Est 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before him with her royal crown. [He wanted] to show off her beauty to the people and the officials, because she was very beautiful.
17Est 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command that was delivered by his eunuchs. The king became furious and his anger burned within him.
17Est 1:13 The king consulted the wise men who understood the times,for it was his normal procedure to confer with experts in law and justice.
17Est 1:14 The most trusted ones were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. They were the seven officials of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and occupied the highest positions in the kingdom.
17Est 1:15 [The king asked,] "According to the law, what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey King Ahasuerus' command that was delivered by the eunuchs?"
17Est 1:16 Memucan said in the presence of the king and his officials, "Queen Vashti has defied not only the king, but all the officials and the peoples who are in every one of King Ahasuerus' provinces.
17Est 1:17 For the queen's action will become public knowledge to all the women and cause them to despise their husbands and say, 'King Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti brought before him, but she did not come.'
17Est 1:18 [Before] this day [is over], the noble women of Persia and Media who hear about the queen's act will say [the same thing] to all the king's officials, resulting in more contempt and fury.
17Est 1:19 "If it meets the king's approval, he should personally issue a royal decree. Let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be revoked: Vashti is not to enter King Ahasuerus' presence, and her royal position is to be given to another woman who is more worthy than she.
17Est 1:20 The decree the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom, so all women will honor their husbands, from the least to the greatest."
17Est 1:21 The king and his counselors approved the proposal, and he followed Memucan's advice.
17Est 1:22 He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each ethnic group in its own language, that every man should be master of his own house and speak in the language of his own people.
17Est 2:1 Some time later, when King Ahasuerus' rage had cooled down, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what was decided against her.
17Est 2:2 The king's personal attendants suggested, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
17Est 2:3 Let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom, so that they may assemble all the beautiful young virgins to the harem at the fortress of Susa. [Put them] under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women, and give them the required beauty treatments.
17Est 2:4 Then the young woman who pleases the king will reign in place of Vashti." This suggestion pleased the king, and he did accordingly.
17Est 2:5 A Jewish man was in the fortress of Susa named Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite.
17Est 2:6 He had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the other captives when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took King Jeconiah of Judah into exile.
17Est 2:7 Mordecai was the legal guardian of his cousin Hadassah (that is, Esther), because she didn't have a father or mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was extremely good-looking. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter.
17Est 2:8 When the king's command and edict became public knowledge, many young women gathered at the fortress of Susa under Hegai's care. Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.
17Est 2:9 The young woman pleased him and gained his favor so that he accelerated the process of the beauty treatments and the special diet that she received. He assigned seven hand-picked female servants to her from the palace and transferred her and her servants to the harem's best quarters.
17Est 2:10 Esther did not reveal her ethnic background or her birthplace, because Mordecai had ordered her not to.
17Est 2:11 Every day Mordecai took a walk in front of the harem's courtyard to learn how Esther was doing and to see what was happening to her.
17Est 2:12 During the year before each young woman's turn to go to King Ahasuerus, the harem regulation required her to receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months and then with perfumes and cosmetics for [another] six months.
17Est 2:13 When the young woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the harem to the palace.
17Est 2:14 She would go in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second harem under the supervision of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch in charge of the concubines. She never went to the king again, unless he desired her and summoned her by name.
17Est 2:15 Esther was the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai who had adopted [her] as his own daughter. When her turn came to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king's trusted official in charge of the harem, suggested. Esther won approval in the sight of everyone who saw her.
17Est 2:16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17Est 2:17 The king loved Esther more than all the other women. She won more favor and approval from him than did any of the other virgins. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.
17Est 2:18 The king held a great banquet for all his officials and staff. It was Esther's banquet. He freed his provinces from tax payments and gave gifts worthy of the king's bounty.
17Est 2:19 When the young women were assembled together for a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the King's Gate.
17Est 2:20 Esther still had not revealed her birthplace or her ethnic background, as Mordecai had directed. She obeyed Mordecai's orders, as she always had while he raised her.
17Est 2:21 During those days while Mordecai was sitting at the King's Gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the [king's] entrance, became infuriated and tried to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17Est 2:22 When Mordecai learned of the plot, he reported it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai's behalf.
17Est 2:23 When the report was investigated and verified, both men were hanged on the gallows. This event was recorded in the court records of daily events in the king's presence.
17Est 3:1 After all this took place, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite. He promoted him in rank and gave him a higher position than all the other officials.
17Est 3:2 The entire royal staff at the King's Gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, because the king had commanded this to be done for him. But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage.
17Est 3:3 The members of the royal staff at the King's Gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you disobeying the king's command?"
17Est 3:4 When they had warned him day after day and he still would not listen to them, they told Haman to see if Mordecai's actions would be tolerated, since he had told them he was a Jew.
17Est 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing down or paying him homage, he was filled with rage.
17Est 3:6 And when he learned of Mordecai's ethnic identity, Haman decided not to do away with Mordecai alone. He set out to destroy all of Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout Ahasuerus' kingdom.
17Est 3:7 In the first month, the month of Nisan, in King Ahasuerus' twelfth year, Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman for each day in each month, and it fell on the twelfth month, the month Adar.
17Est 3:8 Then Haman informed King Ahasuerus, "There is one ethnic group, scattered throughout the peoples in every province of your kingdom, yet living in isolation. Their laws are different from everyone else's, so that they defy the king's laws. It is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.
17Est 3:9 If the king approves, let an order be drawn up authorizing their destruction, and I will pay 375 tons of silver to the accountants for deposit in the royal treasury."
17Est 3:10 The king removed his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jewish people.
17Est 3:11 Then the king told Haman, "The money and people are given to you to do with as you see fit."
17Est 3:12 The royal scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded. [It was intended for] the royal satraps, the governors of each of the provinces, and the officials of each ethnic group and written for each province in its own script and to each ethnic group in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the royal signet ring.
17Est 3:13 Letters were sent by couriers to each of the royal provinces [telling the officials] to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jewish people-- young and old, women and children-- and plunder their possessions on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month.
17Est 3:14 A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples so that they might get ready for that day.
17Est 3:15 The couriers left, spurred on by royal command, and the law was issued in the fortress of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, while the city of Susa was in confusion.
17Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned all that had occurred, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, went into the middle of the city, and cried loudly and bitterly.
17Est 4:2 He only went as far as the King's Gate, since [the law] prohibited anyone wearing sackcloth from entering the King's Gate.
17Est 4:3 There was great mourning among the Jewish people in every province where the king's command and edict came. They fasted, wept, and lamented, and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
17Est 4:4 Esther's female servants and her eunuchs came and reported the news to her, and the queen was overcome with fear. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear so he could take off his sackcloth, but he did not accept [them].
17Est 4:5 Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to her, and dispatched him to Mordecai to learn what he was doing and why.
17Est 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the King's Gate.
17Est 4:7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened as well as the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay the royal treasury for the slaughter of the Jews.
17Est 4:8 Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa ordering their destruction, so that Hathach might show it to Esther, explain it to her, and instruct her to approach the king, implore his favor, and plead with him personally for her people.
17Est 4:9 Hathach came and repeated Mordecai's response to Esther.
17Est 4:10 Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to tell Mordecai,
17Est 4:11 "All the royal officials and the people of the royal provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner courtyard and who has not been summoned-- [the] death [penalty]. Only if the king extends the golden scepter will that person live. I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the last 30 days."
17Est 4:12 Esther's response was reported to Mordecai.
17Est 4:13 Mordecai told [the messenger] to reply to Esther, "Don't think that you will escape the fate of all the Jews because you are in the king's palace.
17Est 4:14 If you keep silent at this time, liberation and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father's house will be destroyed. Who knows, perhaps you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this."
17Est 4:15 Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
17Est 4:16 "Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa and fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, night and day. I and my female servants will also fast in the same way. After that, I will go to the king even if it is against the law. If I perish, I perish."
17Est 4:17 So Mordecai went and did everything Esther had ordered him.
17Est 5:1 On the third day, Esther dressed up in her royal clothing and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace facing it. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing its entrance.
17Est 5:2 As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she won his approval. The king extended the golden scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
17Est 5:3 "What is it, Queen Esther?" the king asked her. "Whatever you want, even to half the kingdom, will be given to you."
17Est 5:4 "If it pleases the king," Esther replied, "may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for them."
17Est 5:5 The king commanded, "Hurry, and get Haman so we can do as Esther has requested." So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17Est 5:6 While drinking the wine, the king asked Esther, "Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you want, even to half the kingdom, will be done."
17Est 5:7 Esther answered, "[This is] my petition and my request:
17Est 5:8 If the king approves of me and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and perform my request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will do what the king has asked."
17Est 5:9 That day Haman left full of joy and in good spirits.But when Haman saw Mordecai at the King's Gate, and Mordecai didn't rise or tremble in fear at his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.
17Est 5:10 Yet Haman controlled himself and went home. He sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh to join him.
17Est 5:11 Then Haman described for them his glorious wealth and his many sons. He told them all how the king had promoted him in rank and given him a high position over the other officials and the royal staff.
17Est 5:12 "What's more," Haman added, "Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she had prepared. I am invited again tomorrow to join her with the king.
17Est 5:13 Still, none of this satisfies me since I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King's Gate all the time."
17Est 5:14 His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, "Have them build a gallows 75 feet high. Ask the king in the morning to hang Mordecai on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself." The advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows constructed.
17Est 6:1 That night sleep escaped the king, so he ordered the book recording daily events to be brought and read to the king.
17Est 6:2 They found the written report of how Mordecai had informed on Bigthana and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the [king's] entrance, when they planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
17Est 6:3 The king inquired, "What honor and special recognition have been given to Mordecai for this [act]?" The king's personal attendants replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
17Est 6:4 The king asked, "Who's in the court?" Now Haman was just entering the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.
17Est 6:5 The king's attendants answered him, "See, Haman is standing in the court." "Have him enter," the king ordered.
17Est 6:6 Haman entered, and the king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king wants to honor?" Haman thought to himself, "Who is it the king would want to honor more than me?"
17Est 6:7 Haman told the king, "For the man the king wants to honor:
17Est 6:8 Have them bring a royal garment that the king himself has worn and a horse the king himself has ridden, which has a royal diadem on its head.
17Est 6:9 Put the garment and the horse under the charge of one of the king's most noble officials. Have them clothe the man the king wants to honor, parade him on the horse through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor.'"
17Est 6:10 The king told Haman, "Hurry, and do just as you proposed. Take a garment and a horse for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the King's Gate. Do not leave out anything you have suggested."
17Est 6:11 So Haman took the garment and the horse. He clothed Mordecai and paraded him through the city square, crying out before him, "This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor."
17Est 6:12 Then Mordecai returned to the King's Gate, but Haman, overwhelmed, hurried off for home with his head covered.
17Est 6:13 Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is Jewish, you won't overcome him, because your downfall is certain."
17Est 6:14 While they were still speaking with him, the eunuchs of the king arrived and rushed Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17Est 7:1 The king and Haman came to feast with Esther the queen.
17Est 7:2 Once again, on the second day while drinking wine, the king asked Esther, "Queen Esther, whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek, even to half the kingdom, will be done."
17Est 7:3 Queen Esther answered, "If I have obtained your approval, my king, and if the king is pleased, spare my life-- [this is] my request; and [spare] my people-- [this is] my desire.
17Est 7:4 For my people and I have been sold out to destruction, death, and extermination. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent. Indeed, the trouble wouldn't be worth burdening the king."
17Est 7:5 King Ahasuerus spoke up and asked Queen Esther, "Who is this, and where is the one who would devise such a scheme?"
17Est 7:6 Esther answered, "The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman." Haman stood terrified before the king and queen.
17Est 7:7 Angered by this, the king arose from where they were drinking wine and [went to] the palace garden. Haman remained to beg Queen Esther for his life because he realized the king was planning something terrible for him.
17Est 7:8 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the house of wine drinking, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Would he actually violate the queen while I am in the palace?" As soon as the statement left the king's mouth, Haman's face was covered.
17Est 7:9 Harbona, one of the royal eunuchs, said: "There is a gallows 75 feet tall at Haman's house that he made for Mordecai, who [gave] the report that saved the king." The king commanded, "Hang him on it."
17Est 7:10 They hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's anger subsided.
17Est 8:1 That same day King Ahasuerus awarded Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Mordecai entered the king's presence because Esther had revealed her relationship to Mordecai.
17Est 8:2 The king removed his signet ring he had recovered from Haman and gave it to Mordecai, and Esther put him in charge of Haman's estate.
17Est 8:3 Then Esther addressed the king again. She fell at his feet, wept, and begged him to revoke the evil of Haman the Agagite, and his plot he had devised against the Jews.
17Est 8:4 The king extended the golden scepter toward Esther, so she got up and stood before the king.
17Est 8:5 She said, "If it pleases the king, and I have found approval before him, if the matter seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let [a royal edict] be written. Let it revoke the documents the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, wrote to destroy the Jews who [reside] in all the king's provinces.
17Est 8:6 For how could I bear to see the evil that would come on my people? How could I bear to see the destruction of my relatives?"
17Est 8:7 King Ahasuerus said to Esther the Queen and to Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I have given Haman's estate to Esther, and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the Jews.
17Est 8:8 You may write in the king's name whatever pleases you concerning the Jews, and seal it with the royal signet ring. A document written in the king's name and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked."
17Est 8:9 On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is, the month Sivan), the royal scribes were summoned. Everything was written exactly as Mordecai ordered for the Jews, to the satraps, the governors, and the officials of the 127 provinces from India to Cush. [The edict was written] for each province in its own script, for each ethnic group in its own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
17Est 8:10 Mordecai wrote in King Ahasuerus' name and sealed [the edicts] with the royal signet ring. He sent the documents by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses bred from the royal racing mares.
17Est 8:11 The king's edict gave the Jews in each and every city the right to assemble and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate every ethnic and provincial army hostile to them, including women and children, and to take their possessions as spoils of war.
17Est 8:12 [This would take place] on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.
17Est 8:13 A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province. It was to be published for every ethnic group so the Jews could be ready to avenge themselves against their enemies on that day.
17Est 8:14 On their royal horses, the couriers rode out in haste, at the king's urgent command. The law was also issued in the fortress of Susa.
17Est 8:15 Mordecai went out from the king's presence clothed in royal purple and white, with a great golden crown and a purple robe of fine linen. The city of Susa shouted and rejoiced,
17Est 8:16 and the Jews celebrated with gladness, joy and honor.
17Est 8:17 In every province and every city, wherever the king's command and his law reached, rejoicing and jubilation took place among the Jews. There was a celebration and a holiday.And, many of the ethnic groups of the land professed themselves to be Jews because fear of the Jews had overcome them.
17Est 9:1 The king's command and law went into effect on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar. On the day when the Jews' enemies had hoped to overpower them, just the opposite happened. The Jews overpowered those who hated them.
17Est 9:2 In each of King Ahasuerus' provinces the Jews assembled in their cities to attack those who intended to harm them. Not a single person could withstand them; terror of them fell on every nationality.
17Est 9:3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the royal civil administrators aided the Jews because they were afraid of Mordecai.
17Est 9:4 For Mordecai [exercised] great power in the palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces as he became more and more powerful.
17Est 9:5 The Jews put all their enemies to the sword, killing and destroying them. They did what they pleased to those who hated them.
17Est 9:6 In the fortress of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men,
17Est 9:7 including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17Est 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
17Est 9:10 They killed these 10 sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. However, they did not seize any plunder.
17Est 9:11 On that day the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa was reported to the king.
17Est 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, "In the fortress of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men, including Haman's 10 sons. What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek will also be done."
17Est 9:13 Esther answered, "If it pleases the king, may the Jews who are in Susa also have tomorrow to carry out today's law, and may [the bodies of] Haman's 10 sons be hung on the gallows."
17Est 9:14 The king gave the orders for this to be done, so a law was announced in Susa, and they hung [the bodies of] Haman's 10 sons.
17Est 9:15 The Jews in Susa assembled again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed 300 men in Susa, but they did not seize any plunder.
17Est 9:16 The rest of the Jews in the royal provinces assembled, defended themselves, and got rid of their enemies. They killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they did not seize any plunder.
17Est 9:17 [They fought] on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar and rested on the fourteenth, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing.
17Est 9:18 But the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. They rested on the fifteenth day of the month, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing.
17Est 9:19 This explains why the rural Jews who live in villages observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as [a time of] rejoicing and feasting. It is a holiday when they send gifts to one another.
17Est 9:20 Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews in all of King Ahasuerus' provinces, both near and far.
17Est 9:21 [He ordered] them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year
17Est 9:22 because during those days the Jews got rid of their enemies. That was the month when their sorrow was turned into rejoicing and their mourning into a holiday. They were to be days of feasting, rejoicing, and of sending gifts to one another and the poor.
17Est 9:23 So the Jews agreed to continue the practice they had begun, as Mordecai had written them to do.
17Est 9:24 For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them. He cast the Pur (that is, the lot) to crush and destroy them.
17Est 9:25 But when the matter was brought before the king, he commanded by letter that the evil plan Haman had devised against the Jews return on his own head and that he should be hanged with his sons on the gallows.
17Est 9:26 For this reason these days are called Purim, from the word Pur. Because of all the instructions in this letter as well as what they had witnessed and what had happened to them,
17Est 9:27 the Jews bound themselves, their descendants, and all who joined with them [to a commitment] that they would not fail to celebrate these two days each and every year according to the written instructions and according to the time appointed.
17Est 9:28 These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life and their memory will not fade from their descendants.
17Est 9:29 Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote this second letter with full authority to confirm the letter about Purim.
17Est 9:30 He sent letters with messages of peace and faithfulness to all the Jews who were in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,
17Est 9:31 in order to confirm these days of Purim at their proper time just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them and just as they had committed themselves and their descendants to the practices of fasting and lamentation.
17Est 9:32 So Esther's command confirmed these customs of Purim, which were then written into the record.
17Est 10:1 King Ahasuerus imposed a tax throughout the land even to the farthest shores.
17Est 10:2 All of his powerful and magnificent accomplishments and the detailed account of Mordecai's great rank to which the king had promoted him, have they not been written in the court record of daily events of the kings of Media and Persia?
17Est 10:3 Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, famous among the Jews, and highly popular with many of his relatives. He continued to seek good for his people and to speak for the welfare of all his kindred.
