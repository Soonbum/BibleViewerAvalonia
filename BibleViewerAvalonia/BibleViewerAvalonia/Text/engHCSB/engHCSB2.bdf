05Dt 1:1 These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
05Dt 1:2 It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
05Dt 1:3 In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moses told the Israelites everything the LORD had commanded him [to say] to them.
05Dt 1:4 This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
05Dt 1:5 Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:
05Dt 1:6 "The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, 'You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
05Dt 1:7 Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites and their neighbors in the Arabah, the hill country, the lowlands, the Negev and the sea coast-- to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the Euphrates River.
05Dt 1:8 See, I have set the land before you. Enter and take possession of the land the LORD swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants after them.'
05Dt 1:9 "I said to you at that time: I can't bear [the responsibility for] you on my own.
05Dt 1:10 The LORD your God has so multiplied you that today you are as numerous as the stars of the sky.
05Dt 1:11 May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times more, and bless you as He promised you.
05Dt 1:12 But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes by myself?
05Dt 1:13 Appoint for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will make them your leaders.
05Dt 1:14 "You replied to me, 'What you propose to do is good.'
05Dt 1:15 "So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and set them over you as leaders: officials for thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes.
05Dt 1:16 I commanded your judges at that time: Hear [the cases] between your brothers, and judge rightly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident.
05Dt 1:17 Do not show partiality when rendering judgment; listen to small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.
05Dt 1:18 At that time I commanded you about all the things you were to do.
05Dt 1:19 "We then set out from Horeb and went across all the great and terrible wilderness you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,
05Dt 1:20 I said to you: You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
05Dt 1:21 See, the LORD your God has set the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
05Dt 1:22 "Then all of you approached me and said, 'Let's send men ahead of us, so that they may explore the land for us and bring us back a report about the route we should go up and the cities we will come to.'
05Dt 1:23 The plan seemed good to me, so I selected 12 men from among you, one man for each tribe.
05Dt 1:24 They left and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol, scouting the land.
05Dt 1:25 They took some of the fruit from the land in their hands, carried [it] down to us, and brought us back a report: 'The land the LORD our God is giving us is good.'
05Dt 1:26 "But you were not willing to go up, rebelling against the command of the LORD your God.
05Dt 1:27 You grumbled in your tents and said, 'The LORD brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they would destroy us, because He hated us.
05Dt 1:28 Where can we go? Our brothers have discouraged us, saying: The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, fortified to the heavens. We also saw the descendants of the Anakim there.'
05Dt 1:29 "So I said to you: Don't be terrified or afraid of them!
05Dt 1:30 The LORD your God who goes before you will fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt.
05Dt 1:31 And you saw in the wilderness how the LORD your God carried you as a man carries his son all along the way you traveled until you reached this place.
05Dt 1:32 But in spite of this you did not trust the LORD your God,
05Dt 1:33 who went before you on the journey to seek out a place for you to camp. He went in the fire by night and in the cloud by day to guide you on the road you were to travel.
05Dt 1:34 "When the LORD heard your words, He grew angry and swore an oath:
05Dt 1:35 'None of these men in this evil generation will see the good land I swore to give your fathers,
05Dt 1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed the LORD completely.'
05Dt 1:37 "The LORD was angry with me also because of you and said: 'You will not enter there either.
05Dt 1:38 Joshua son of Nun, who attends you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit it.
05Dt 1:39 Your little children who you said would be plunder, your sons who don't know good from evil, will enter there. I will give them the land, and they will take possession of it.
05Dt 1:40 But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.'
05Dt 1:41 "You answered me, 'We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight just as the LORD our God commanded us.' Then each of you put on his weapons of war and thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:42 "But the LORD said to me, 'Tell them: Don't go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from being defeated by your enemies.'
05Dt 1:43 So I spoke to you, but you didn't listen. You rebelled against the LORD's command and defiantly went up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:44 Then the Amorites who lived there came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir as far as Hormah.
05Dt 1:45 When you returned, you wept before the LORD, but He didn't listen to your requests or pay attention to you.
05Dt 1:46 For this reason you stayed in Kadesh as long as you did.
05Dt 2:1 "Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had told me, and we traveled around the hill country of Seir for many days.
05Dt 2:2 The LORD then said to me,
05Dt 2:3 'You've been traveling around this hill country long enough; turn north.
05Dt 2:4 Command the people: You are about to travel through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful.
05Dt 2:5 Don't fight with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even an inch of it, because I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as [his] possession.
05Dt 2:6 You may purchase food from them with silver, so that you may eat, and buy water from them to drink.
05Dt 2:7 For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this immense wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you this past 40 years, and you have lacked nothing.'
05Dt 2:8 "So we bypassed our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. [We turned] away from the Arabah road and from Elath and Ezion-geber. We traveled along the road to the Wilderness of Moab.
05Dt 2:9 The LORD said to me, 'Show no hostility toward Moab, and do not provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, since I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.'"
05Dt 2:10 The Emim, a great and numerous people as tall as the Anakim, had previously lived there.
05Dt 2:11 They were also regarded as Rephaim, like the Anakim, though the Moabites called them Emim.
05Dt 2:12 The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them completely and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land of its possession the LORD gave them.
05Dt 2:13 "[The LORD said,] 'Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.' So we crossed the Zered Valley.
05Dt 2:14 The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was 38 years until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
05Dt 2:15 Indeed, the LORD's hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp until they had all perished.
05Dt 2:16 "When all the fighting men had died among the people,
05Dt 2:17 the LORD spoke to me,
05Dt 2:18 'Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
05Dt 2:19 When you get close to the Ammonites, don't show any hostility to them or fight with them, for I will not give you any of the Ammonites' land as a possession; I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.'"
05Dt 2:20 This too used to be regarded as the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived there previously, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,
05Dt 2:21 a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim. The LORD destroyed the Rephaim at the advance of the Ammonites, so that they drove them out and settled in their place.
05Dt 2:22 This was just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them; they drove them out and have lived in their place until now.
05Dt 2:23 The Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and settled in their place.
05Dt 2:24 "[The LORD also said,] 'Get up, move out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have handed Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land over to you. Begin to take possession [of it]; engage him in battle.
05Dt 2:25 Today I will begin to put the fear and dread of you on the peoples everywhere under heaven. They will hear the report about you, tremble, and be in anguish because of you.'
05Dt 2:26 "So I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon from the Wilderness of Kedemoth, saying,
05Dt 2:27 'Let us travel through your land; we will keep strictly to the highway. We will not turn to the right or the left.
05Dt 2:28 You can sell us food in exchange for silver so we may eat, and give us water for silver so we may drink. Only let us travel through on foot,
05Dt 2:29 just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for us, and the Moabites who live in Ar, until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.'
05Dt 2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the LORD your God made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you, as has now taken place.
05Dt 2:31 "Then the LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession of it.'
05Dt 2:32 So Sihon and his whole army came out against us for battle at Jahaz.
05Dt 2:33 The LORD our God handed him over to us, and we defeated him, his sons, and his whole army.
05Dt 2:34 At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the people of every city, including the women and children. We left no survivors.
05Dt 2:35 We took only the livestock and the spoil from the cities we captured as plunder for ourselves.
05Dt 2:36 There was no city that was inaccessible to us, from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead. The LORD our God gave everything to us.
05Dt 2:37 But you did not go near the Ammonites' land, all along the bank of the Jabbok River and the cities of the hill country, everything that the LORD our God had commanded.
05Dt 3:1 "Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan, with his whole army, came out against us for battle at Edrei.
05Dt 3:2 But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'
05Dt 3:3 So the LORD our God also handed over Og king of Bashan and his whole army to us. We struck him until there was no survivor left.
05Dt 3:4 We captured all his cities at that time. There wasn't a city that we didn't take from them: 60 cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05Dt 3:5 All these were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a large number of rural villages.
05Dt 3:6 We completely destroyed them, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
05Dt 3:7 But we took all the livestock and the spoil from the cities as plunder for ourselves.
05Dt 3:8 "At that time we took the land from the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon,
05Dt 3:9 which the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call Senir,
05Dt 3:10 all the cities of the plateau, Gilead, and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
05Dt 3:11 (Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron. Isn't it in Rabbah of the Ammonites? It is 13 feet six inches long and six feet wide by a standard measure.)
05Dt 3:12 "At that time we took possession of this land. I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites [the area extending] from Aroer by the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead along with its cities.
05Dt 3:13 I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.
05Dt 3:14 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took over the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name, Jair's Villages, as it is today.
05Dt 3:15 I gave Gilead to Machir,
05Dt 3:16 and I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites [the area extending] from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.
05Dt 3:17 The Arabah and Jordan are also borders from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
05Dt 3:18 "I commanded you at that time: The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your fighting men will cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers the Israelites.
05Dt 3:19 But your wives, young children, and livestock-- I know that you have a lot of livestock-- will remain in the cities I have given you
05Dt 3:20 until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they also take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession that I have given you.
05Dt 3:21 "I commanded Joshua at that time: Your own eyes have seen everything the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
05Dt 3:22 Don't be afraid of them, for the LORD your God fights for you.
05Dt 3:23 "At that time I begged the LORD:
05Dt 3:24 Lord God, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to Your servant, for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform deeds and mighty acts like Yours?
05Dt 3:25 Please let me cross over and see the beautiful land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.
05Dt 3:26 "But the LORD was angry with me on account of you and would not listen to me. The LORD said to me, 'That's enough! Do not speak to Me again about this matter.
05Dt 3:27 Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west, north, south, and east, and see [it] with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.
05Dt 3:28 But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit this land that you will see.'
05Dt 3:29 So we stayed in the valley facing Beth-peor.
05Dt 4:1 "Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live, enter, and take possession of the land the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
05Dt 4:2 You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, so that you may keep the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you.
05Dt 4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed every one of you who followed Baal of Peor.
05Dt 4:4 But you who have remained faithful to the LORD your God are all alive today.
05Dt 4:5 Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 4:6 Carefully follow [them], for this will [show] your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. When they hear about all these statutes, they will say, 'This great nation is indeed a wise and understanding people.'
05Dt 4:7 For what great nation is there that has a god near to it as the LORD our God is [to us] whenever we call to Him?
05Dt 4:8 And what great nation has righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today?
05Dt 4:9 "Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you don't forget the things your eyes have seen and so that they don't slip from your mind as long as you live. Teach them to your children and your grandchildren.
05Dt 4:10 The day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people before Me, and I will let them hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth and may instruct their children.'
05Dt 4:11 You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire into the heavens and enveloped in a dense, black cloud.
05Dt 4:12 Then the LORD spoke to you from the fire. You kept hearing the sound of the words, but didn't see a form; there was only a voice.
05Dt 4:13 He declared His covenant to you. He commanded you to follow the Ten Commandments, which He wrote on two stone tablets.
05Dt 4:14 At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to follow in the land you are about to cross into and possess.
05Dt 4:15 "Be extremely careful for your own good-- because you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire--
05Dt 4:16 not to act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form,
05Dt 4:17 or the form of any beast on the earth, any winged creature that flies in the sky,
05Dt 4:18 any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the waters under the earth.
05Dt 4:19 When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars-- all the array of heaven-- do not be led astray to bow down and worship them. The LORD your God has provided them for all people everywhere under heaven.
05Dt 4:20 But the LORD selected you and brought you out of Egypt's iron furnace to be a people for His inheritance, as you are today.
05Dt 4:21 "The LORD was angry with me on your account. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 4:22 I won't be crossing the Jordan because I am going to die in this land. But you are about to cross over and take possession of this good land.
05Dt 4:23 Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you, and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of anything He has forbidden you.
05Dt 4:24 For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
05Dt 4:25 "When you have children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and if you act corruptly, make an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, provoking Him to anger,
05Dt 4:26 I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. You will not live long there, but you will certainly be destroyed.
05Dt 4:27 The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be reduced to a few survivors among the nations where the LORD your God will drive you.
05Dt 4:28 There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see, hear, eat, or smell.
05Dt 4:29 But from there, you will search for the LORD your God, and you will find [Him] when you seek Him with all your heart and all your soul.
05Dt 4:30 When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, you will return to the LORD your God in later days and obey Him.
05Dt 4:31 He will not leave you, destroy you, or forget the covenant with your fathers that He swore to them by oath, because the LORD your God is a compassionate God.
05Dt 4:32 "Indeed, ask about the earlier days that preceded you, from the day God created man on the earth and from one end of the heavens to the other: Has anything like this great event [ever] happened, or has anything like it been heard of?
05Dt 4:33 Has a people ever heard God's voice speaking from the fire as you have, and lived?
05Dt 4:34 Or has a god [ever] attempted to go and take a nation as his own out of [another] nation, by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
05Dt 4:35 You were shown [these things] so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him.
05Dt 4:36 He let you hear His voice from heaven to instruct you. He showed you His great fire on earth, and you heard His words from the fire.
05Dt 4:37 Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power,
05Dt 4:38 to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as is now taking place.
05Dt 4:39 Today, recognize and keep in mind that the LORD is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other.
05Dt 4:40 Keep His statutes and commands, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper and so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east,
05Dt 4:42 where one could flee who committed manslaughter and killed his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him. He could flee to one of these cities and stay alive:
05Dt 4:43 Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau land, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; or Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites.
05Dt 4:44 This is the law Moses gave the Israelites.
05Dt 4:45 These are the decrees, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they came out of Egypt,
05Dt 4:46 across the Jordan in the valley facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and Moses and the Israelites defeated him after they came out of Egypt.
05Dt 4:47 They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan to the east,
05Dt 4:48 from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon)
05Dt 4:49 and all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.
05Dt 5:1 Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming as you hear them today. Learn and follow them carefully.
05Dt 5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
05Dt 5:3 He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with all of us who are alive here today.
05Dt 5:4 The LORD spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain.
05Dt 5:5 At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to report the word of the LORD to you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And He said:
05Dt 5:6 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
05Dt 5:7 Do not have other gods besides Me.
05Dt 5:8 Do not make an idol for yourself in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.
05Dt 5:9 You must not bow down to them or worship them, because I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the fathers' sin to the third and fourth [generations] of those who hate Me,
05Dt 5:10 but showing faithful love to a thousand [generations] of those who love Me and keep My commands.
05Dt 5:11 Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, because the LORD will punish anyone who misuses His name.
05Dt 5:12 Be careful to dedicate the Sabbath day, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
05Dt 5:13 You are to labor six days and do all your work,
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. You must not do any work-- you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your ox or donkey, any of your livestock, or the foreigner who lives within your gates, so that your male and female slaves may rest as you do.
05Dt 5:15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
05Dt 5:16 Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and so that you may prosper in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 5:17 Do not murder.
05Dt 5:18 Do not commit adultery.
05Dt 5:19 Do not steal.
05Dt 5:20 Do not give dishonest testimony against your neighbor.
05Dt 5:21 Do not desire your neighbor's wife or covet your neighbor's house, his field, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
05Dt 5:22 "The LORD spoke these commands in a loud voice to your entire assembly from the fire, cloud, and thick darkness on the mountain; He added nothing more. He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
05Dt 5:23 All of you approached me with your tribal leaders and elders when you heard the voice from the darkness and while the mountain was blazing with fire.
05Dt 5:24 You said, 'Look, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice from the fire. Today we have seen that God speaks with a person, yet he still lives.
05Dt 5:25 But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer.
05Dt 5:26 For who out of all mankind has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire, as we have, and lived?
05Dt 5:27 Go near and listen to everything the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen and obey.'
05Dt 5:28 "The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me. He said to me, 'I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you. Everything they have said is right.
05Dt 5:29 If only they had such a heart to fear Me and keep all My commands, so that they and their children will prosper forever.
05Dt 5:30 Go and tell them: Return to your tents.
05Dt 5:31 But you stand here with Me, and I will tell you every command-- the statutes and ordinances-- you are to teach them, so that they may follow [them] in the land I am giving them to possess.'
05Dt 5:32 "Be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or the left.
05Dt 5:33 Follow the whole instruction the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, prosper, and have a long life in the land you will possess.
05Dt 6:1 "This is the command-- the statutes and ordinances-- the LORD your God has instructed [me] to teach you, so that you may follow [them] in the land you are about to enter and possess.
05Dt 6:2 [Do this] so that you may fear the LORD your God all the days of your life by keeping all His statutes and commands I am giving you, your son, and your grandson, and so that you may have a long life.
05Dt 6:3 Listen, Israel, and be careful to follow [them], so that you may prosper and multiply greatly, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 6:4 "Listen, Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One.
05Dt 6:5 Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
05Dt 6:6 These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart.
05Dt 6:7 Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05Dt 6:8 Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be a symbol on your forehead.
05Dt 6:9 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
05Dt 6:10 "When the LORD your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would give you-- a [land with] large and beautiful cities that you did not build,
05Dt 6:11 houses full of every good thing that you did not fill [them with], wells dug that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant-- and when you eat and are satisfied,
05Dt 6:12 be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
05Dt 6:13 Fear the LORD your God, worship Him, and take [your] oaths in His name.
05Dt 6:14 Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you,
05Dt 6:15 for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God. Otherwise, the LORD your God will become angry with you and wipe you off the face of the earth.
05Dt 6:16 Do not test the LORD your God as you tested [Him] at Massah.
05Dt 6:17 Carefully observe the commands of the LORD your God, the decrees and statutes He has commanded you.
05Dt 6:18 Do what is right and good in the LORD's sight, so that you may prosper and so that you may enter and possess the good land the LORD your God swore to [give] your fathers,
05Dt 6:19 by driving out all your enemies before you, as the LORD has said.
05Dt 6:20 "When your son asks you in the future, 'What is the meaning of the decrees, statutes, and ordinances, which the LORD our God has commanded you?'
05Dt 6:21 tell him, 'We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand.
05Dt 6:22 Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh and all his household,
05Dt 6:23 but He brought us from there in order to lead us in and give us the land that He swore to our fathers.
05Dt 6:24 The LORD commanded us to follow all these statutes and to fear the LORD our God for our prosperity always and for our preservation, as it is today.
05Dt 6:25 Righteousness will be ours if we are careful to follow every one of these commands before the LORD our God, as He has commanded us.'
05Dt 7:1 "When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, and He drives out many nations before you-- the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations more numerous and powerful than you--
05Dt 7:2 and when the LORD your God delivers them over to you and you defeat them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.
05Dt 7:3 Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
05Dt 7:4 because they will turn your sons away from Me to worship other gods. Then the LORD's anger will burn against you, and He will swiftly destroy you.
05Dt 7:5 Instead, this is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their standing pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn up their carved images.
05Dt 7:6 For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be His own possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
05Dt 7:7 "The LORD was devoted to you and chose you, not because you were more numerous than all peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
05Dt 7:8 But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers, He brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the place of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05Dt 7:9 Know that Yahweh your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His gracious covenant loyalty for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commands.
05Dt 7:10 But He directly pays back and destroys those who hate Him. He will not hesitate to directly pay back the one who hates Him.
05Dt 7:11 So keep the command-- the statutes and ordinances-- that I am giving you to follow today.
05Dt 7:12 "If you listen to and are careful to keep these ordinances, the LORD your God will keep His covenant loyalty with you, as He swore to your fathers.
05Dt 7:13 He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will bless your descendants, and the produce of your soil-- your grain, new wine, and oil-- the young of your herds, and the newborn of your flocks, in the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you.
05Dt 7:14 You will be blessed above all peoples; there will be no infertile male or female among you or your livestock.
05Dt 7:15 The LORD will remove all sickness from you; He will not put on you all the terrible diseases of Egypt that you know about, but He will inflict them on all who hate you.
05Dt 7:16 You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God is delivering over to you and not look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
05Dt 7:17 "If you say to yourself, 'These nations are greater than I; how can I drive them out?'
05Dt 7:18 do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
05Dt 7:19 the great trials that you saw, the signs and wonders, the strong hand and outstretched arm, by which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you fear.
05Dt 7:20 The LORD your God will also send the hornet against them until all the survivors and those hiding from you perish.
05Dt 7:21 Don't be terrified of them, for the LORD your God, a great and awesome God, is among you.
05Dt 7:22 The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be able to destroy them all at once; otherwise, the wild animals will become too numerous for you.
05Dt 7:23 The LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
05Dt 7:24 He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate them.
05Dt 7:25 You must burn up the carved images of their gods. Don't covet the silver and gold on the images and take it for yourself, or else you will be ensnared by it, for it is abhorrent to the LORD your God.
05Dt 7:26 You must not bring any abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You are to utterly detest and abhor it, because it is set apart for destruction.
05Dt 8:1 "You must carefully follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase, and may enter and take possession of the land the LORD swore to your fathers.
05Dt 8:2 Remember that the LORD your God led you on the entire journey these 40 years in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commands.
05Dt 8:3 He humbled you by letting you go hungry; then He gave you manna to eat, which you and your fathers had not known, so that you might learn that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
05Dt 8:4 Your clothing did not wear out, and your feet did not swell these 40 years.
05Dt 8:5 Keep in mind that the LORD your God has been disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.
05Dt 8:6 So keep the commands of the LORD your God by walking in His ways and fearing Him.
05Dt 8:7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with streams of water, springs, and deep water sources, flowing in both valleys and hills;
05Dt 8:8 a land of wheat, barley, vines, figs, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
05Dt 8:9 a land where you will eat food without shortage, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and from whose hills you will mine copper.
05Dt 8:10 When you eat and are full, you will praise the LORD your God for the good land He has given you.
05Dt 8:11 "Be careful that you don't forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His command-- the ordinances and statutes-- I am giving you today.
05Dt 8:12 When you eat and are full, and build beautiful houses to live in,
05Dt 8:13 and your herds and flocks grow large, and your silver and gold multiply, and everything else you have increases,
05Dt 8:14 [be careful] that your heart doesn't become proud and you forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
05Dt 8:15 He led you through the great and terrible wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty land where there was no water. He brought water out of the flintlike rock for you.
05Dt 8:16 He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper.
05Dt 8:17 You may say to yourself, 'My power and my own ability have gained this wealth for me,'
05Dt 8:18 but remember that the LORD your God gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant He swore to your fathers, as it is today.
05Dt 8:19 If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will perish.
05Dt 8:20 Like the nations the LORD is about to destroy before you, you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God.
05Dt 9:1 "Listen, Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go and drive out nations greater and stronger than you [with] large cities fortified to the heavens.
05Dt 9:2 The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them and you have heard it said about them, 'Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?'
05Dt 9:3 But understand that today the LORD your God will cross over ahead of you as a consuming fire; He will devastate and subdue them before you. You will drive them out and destroy them swiftly, as the LORD has told you.
05Dt 9:4 When the LORD your God drives them out before you, do not say to yourself, 'The LORD brought me in to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.' Instead, the LORD will drive out these nations before you because of their wickedness.
05Dt 9:5 You are not going to take possession of their land because of your righteousness or your integrity. Instead, the LORD your God will drive out these nations before you because of their wickedness, in order to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05Dt 9:6 Understand that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.
05Dt 9:7 "Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness. You have been rebelling against the LORD from the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place.
05Dt 9:8 You provoked the LORD at Horeb, and He was angry enough with you to destroy you.
05Dt 9:9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights. I did not eat bread or drink water.
05Dt 9:10 On the day of the assembly the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by God's finger. The exact words were on them, which the LORD spoke to you from the fire on the mountain.
05Dt 9:11 The LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant, at the end of the 40 days and 40 nights.
05Dt 9:12 "The LORD said to me, 'Get up and go down immediately from here. For your people you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned from the way that I commanded them; they have made a cast image for themselves.'
05Dt 9:13 The LORD also said to me, 'I have seen this people, and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people.
05Dt 9:14 Leave Me alone, and I will destroy them and blot out their name under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.'
05Dt 9:15 "So I went back down the mountain, while it was blazing with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
05Dt 9:16 I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made a calf image for yourselves. You had quickly turned from the way the LORD had commanded for you.
05Dt 9:17 So I took hold of the tablets and threw them from my hands, shattering them before your eyes.
05Dt 9:18 Then I fell down like the first time in the presence of the LORD for 40 days and 40 nights; I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you committed, doing what was evil in the LORD's sight and provoking Him to anger.
05Dt 9:19 I was afraid of the fierce anger the LORD had directed against you, because He was about to destroy you. But again, the LORD listened to me on that occasion.
05Dt 9:20 The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. But I prayed for Aaron at that time also.
05Dt 9:21 I took the sinful calf you had made, burned it up, and crushed it, thoroughly grinding it to powder as [fine as] dust. Then I threw it into the stream that came down from the mountain.
05Dt 9:22 "You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah.
05Dt 9:23 When the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, He said, 'Go up and possess the land I have given you'; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not believe or obey Him.
05Dt 9:24 You have been rebelling against the LORD ever since I have known you.
05Dt 9:25 "I fell down in the presence of the LORD 40 days and 40 nights because the LORD had threatened to destroy you.
05Dt 9:26 I prayed to the LORD: Lord God, do not annihilate Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.
05Dt 9:27 Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Disregard this people's stubbornness, and their wickedness and sin.
05Dt 9:28 Otherwise, those in the land you brought us from will say, 'Because the LORD wasn't able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.'
05Dt 9:29 But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.
05Dt 10:1 "The LORD said to me at that time, 'Cut two stone tablets like the first ones and come to Me on the mountain and make a wooden ark.
05Dt 10:2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you are to place them in the ark.'
05Dt 10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and climbed the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
05Dt 10:4 Then, on the day of the assembly, the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain from the fire. The LORD gave them to me,
05Dt 10:5 and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. And they have remained there, as the LORD commanded me."
05Dt 10:6 The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. Aaron died and was buried there, and Eleazar his son became priest in his place.
05Dt 10:7 They traveled from there to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
05Dt 10:8 "At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the LORD's covenant, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to bless in His name, as it is today.
05Dt 10:9 For this reason, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance like his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God told him.
05Dt 10:10 "I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights like the first time. The LORD also listened to me on this occasion; He agreed not to annihilate you.
05Dt 10:11 Then the LORD said to me, 'Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to give their fathers.'
05Dt 10:12 "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you except to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His ways, to love Him, and to worship the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul?
05Dt 10:13 Keep the LORD's commands and statutes I am giving you today, for your own good.
05Dt 10:14 The heavens, indeed the highest heavens, belong to the LORD your God, as does the earth and everything in it.
05Dt 10:15 Yet the LORD was devoted to your fathers and loved them. He chose their descendants after them-- [He chose] you out of all the peoples, as it is today.
05Dt 10:16 Therefore, circumcise your hearts and don't be stiff-necked any longer.
05Dt 10:17 For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no partiality and taking no bribe.
05Dt 10:18 He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreign resident, giving him food and clothing.
05Dt 10:19 You also must love the foreigner, since you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
05Dt 10:20 You are to fear the LORD your God and worship Him. Remain faithful to Him and take oaths in His name.
05Dt 10:21 He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome works your eyes have seen.
05Dt 10:22 Your fathers went down to Egypt, 70 people in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.
05Dt 11:1 "Therefore, love the LORD your God and always keep His mandate and His statutes, ordinances, and commands.
05Dt 11:2 You must understand today that it is not your children who experienced or saw the discipline of the LORD your God: His greatness, strong hand, and outstretched arm;
05Dt 11:3 His signs and the works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;
05Dt 11:4 what He did to Egypt's army, its horses and chariots, when He made the waters of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, and He destroyed them completely;
05Dt 11:5 what He did to you in the wilderness until you reached this place;
05Dt 11:6 and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when in the middle of the whole Israelite [camp] the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing with them.
05Dt 11:7 Your [own] eyes have seen every great work the LORD has done.
05Dt 11:8 "Keep every command I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to cross into and possess the land you are to inherit,
05Dt 11:9 and so that you may live long in the land the LORD swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 11:10 For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated by hand as in a vegetable garden.
05Dt 11:11 But the land you are entering to possess is a land of mountains and valleys, watered by rain from the sky.
05Dt 11:12 It is a land the LORD your God cares for. He is always watching over it from the beginning to the end of the year.
05Dt 11:13 "If you carefully obey My commands I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all your heart and all your soul,
05Dt 11:14 I will provide rain for your land in season, the early and late rains, and you will harvest your grain, new wine, and oil.
05Dt 11:15 I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock. You will eat and be satisfied.
05Dt 11:16 Be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside, worship, and bow down to other gods.
05Dt 11:17 Then the LORD's anger will burn against you. He will close the sky, and there will be no rain; the land will not yield its produce, and you will perish quickly from the good land the LORD is giving you.
05Dt 11:18 "Impress these words of Mine on your hearts and souls, bind them as a sign on your hands, and let them be a symbol on your foreheads.
05Dt 11:19 Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05Dt 11:20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
05Dt 11:21 so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your days and those of your children may be many in the land the LORD swore to give your fathers.
05Dt 11:22 For if you carefully observe every one of these commands I am giving you to follow-- to love the LORD your God, walk in all His ways, and remain faithful to Him--
05Dt 11:23 the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will drive out nations greater and stronger than you are.
05Dt 11:24 Every place the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.
05Dt 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put fear and dread of you in all the land where you set foot, as He has promised you.
05Dt 11:26 "Look, today I set before you a blessing and a curse:
05Dt 11:27 [there will be] a blessing, if you obey the commands of the LORD your God I am giving you today,
05Dt 11:28 and a curse, if you do not obey the commands of the LORD your God, and you turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods you have not known.
05Dt 11:29 When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing at Mount Gerizim and the curse at Mount Ebal.
05Dt 11:30 Aren't these mountains across the Jordan, beyond the western road in the land of the Canaanites, who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, near the oaks of Moreh?
05Dt 11:31 For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you possess it and settle in it,
05Dt 11:32 be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances I set before you today.
05Dt 12:1 "Be careful to follow these statutes and ordinances in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess all the days you live on the earth.
05Dt 12:2 Destroy completely all the places where the nations you are driving out worship their gods-- on the high mountains, on the hills, and under every flourishing tree.
05Dt 12:3 Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah poles, cut down the carved images of their gods, and wipe out their names from every place.
05Dt 12:4 Don't worship the LORD your God this way.
05Dt 12:5 Instead, you must go to the place the LORD your God chooses from all your tribes to put His name for His dwelling.
05Dt 12:6 You are to bring there your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tenths and personal contributions, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
05Dt 12:7 You will eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your household in everything you do, because the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 12:8 "You are not to do as we are doing here today; everyone [is doing] whatever seems right in his own eyes.
05Dt 12:9 Indeed, you have not yet come into the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 12:10 When you cross the Jordan and live in the land the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you live in security,
05Dt 12:11 then the LORD your God will choose the place to have His name dwell. Bring there everything I command you: your burnt offerings, sacrifices, offerings of the tenth, personal contributions, and all your choice offerings you vow to the LORD.
05Dt 12:12 You will rejoice before the LORD your God-- you, your sons and daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
05Dt 12:13 Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in all the [sacred] places you see.
05Dt 12:14 You must offer your burnt offerings only in the place the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, and there you must do everything I command you.
05Dt 12:15 "But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you. Those who are clean or unclean may eat it, as they would a gazelle or deer,
05Dt 12:16 but you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:17 Within your gates you may not eat: the tenth of your grain, new wine, or oil; the firstborn of your herd or flock; any of your vow offerings that you pledge; your freewill offerings; or your personal contributions.
05Dt 12:18 You must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God chooses-- you, your son and daughter, your male and female slave, and the Levite who is within your gates. Rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you do,
05Dt 12:19 and be careful not to neglect the Levite, as long as you live in your land.
05Dt 12:20 "When the LORD your God enlarges your territory as He has promised you, and you say, 'I want to eat meat' because you have a strong desire to eat meat, you may eat it whenever you want.
05Dt 12:21 If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, you may slaughter any of your herd or flock He has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want.
05Dt 12:22 Indeed, you may eat it as the gazelle and deer are eaten; both the clean and the unclean may eat it.
05Dt 12:23 But don't eat the blood, since the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
05Dt 12:24 Do not eat blood; pour it on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:25 Do not eat it, so that you and your children after you will prosper, because you will be doing what is right in the LORD's sight.
05Dt 12:26 "But you are to take the holy offerings you have and your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD chooses.
05Dt 12:27 Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your [other] sacrifices is to be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.
05Dt 12:28 Be careful to obey all these things I command you, so that you and your children after you may prosper forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 12:29 "When the LORD your God annihilates the nations before you, which you are entering to take possession of, and you drive them out and live in their land,
05Dt 12:30 be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, asking, 'How did these nations worship their gods? I'll also do the same.'
05Dt 12:31 You must not do the same to the LORD your God, because they practice for their gods every detestable thing the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
05Dt 12:32  You must be careful to do everything I command you; do not add anything to it or take anything away from it.
05Dt 13:1 "If a prophet or someone who has dreams arises among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you,
05Dt 13:2 and that sign or wonder he has promised you comes about, but he says, 'Let us follow other gods,' which you have not known, 'and let us worship them,'
05Dt 13:3 do not listen to that prophet's words or to that dreamer. For the LORD your God is testing you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul.
05Dt 13:4 You must follow the LORD your God and fear Him. You must keep His commands and listen to His voice; you must worship Him and remain faithful to Him.
05Dt 13:5 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he has urged rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the place of slavery, to turn you from the way the LORD your God has commanded you to walk. You must purge the evil from you.
05Dt 13:6 "If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, 'Let us go and worship other gods'-- which neither you nor your fathers have known,
05Dt 13:7 any of the gods of the peoples around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other--
05Dt 13:8 you must not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity, and do not spare [him] or shield him.
05Dt 13:9 Instead, you must kill him. Your hand is to be the first against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people.
05Dt 13:10 Stone him to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
05Dt 13:11 All Israel will hear and be afraid, and they will no longer do anything evil like this among you.
05Dt 13:12 "If you hear it said about one of your cities the LORD your God is giving you to live in,
05Dt 13:13 that wicked men have sprung up among you, led the inhabitants of their city astray, and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods,' which you have not known,
05Dt 13:14 you are to inquire, investigate, and interrogate thoroughly. If the report turns out to be true that this detestable thing has happened among you,
05Dt 13:15 you must strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword. Completely destroy everyone in it as well as its livestock with the sword.
05Dt 13:16 You are to gather all its spoil in the middle of the city square and completely burn up the city and all its spoil for the LORD your God. The city must remain a mound of ruins forever; it is not to be rebuilt.
05Dt 13:17 Nothing set apart for destruction is to remain in your hand, so that the LORD will turn from His burning anger and grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers.
05Dt 13:18 This [will occur] if you obey the LORD your God, keeping all His commands I am giving you today, doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 14:1 "You are sons of the LORD your God; do not cut yourselves or make a bald spot on your head on behalf of the dead,
05Dt 14:2 for you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD has chosen you to be His special people out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
05Dt 14:3 "You must not eat any detestable thing.
05Dt 14:4 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05Dt 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
05Dt 14:6 You may eat any animal that has hooves divided in two and chews the cud.
05Dt 14:7 But among the ones that chew the cud or have divided hooves, you are not to eat these: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax, though they chew the cud, they do not have hooves-- they are unclean for you;
05Dt 14:8 and the pig, though it has hooves, it does not [chew] the cud-- it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
05Dt 14:9 "You may eat everything from the water that has fins and scales,
05Dt 14:10 but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales-- it is unclean for you.
05Dt 14:11 "You may eat every clean bird,
05Dt 14:12 but these are the ones you may not eat: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
05Dt 14:13 the kite, the various kinds of falcon,
05Dt 14:14 every kind of raven,
05Dt 14:15 the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the gull, the various kinds of hawk,
05Dt 14:16 the little owl, the long-eared owl, the white owl,
05Dt 14:17 the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
05Dt 14:18 the stork, the various kinds of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
05Dt 14:19 All winged insects are unclean for you; they may not be eaten.
05Dt 14:20 But you may eat every clean flying creature.
05Dt 14:21 "You are not to eat any carcass; you may give it to a resident alien within your gates, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
05Dt 14:22 "Each year you are to set aside a tenth of all the produce grown in your fields.
05Dt 14:23 You are to eat a tenth of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herd and flock, in the presence of the LORD your God at the place where He chooses to have His name dwell, so that you will always learn to fear the LORD your God.
05Dt 14:24 But if the distance is too great for you to carry it, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far away from you and since the LORD your God has blessed you,
05Dt 14:25 then exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place the LORD your God chooses.
05Dt 14:26 You may spend the money on anything you want: cattle, sheep, wine, beer, or anything you desire. You are to feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your family.
05Dt 14:27 Do not forget the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
05Dt 14:28 "At the end of [every] three years, bring a tenth of all your produce for that year and store [it] within your gates.
05Dt 14:29 Then the Levite, who has no portion or inheritance among you, the foreign resident, fatherless, and widow within your gates may come, eat, and be satisfied. And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands that you do.
05Dt 15:1 "At the end of [every] seven years you must cancel debts.
05Dt 15:2 This is how to cancel debt: Every creditor is to cancel what he has lent his neighbor. He is not to collect [anything] from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD's release of debts has been proclaimed.
05Dt 15:3 You may collect [something] from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you.
05Dt 15:4 "There will be no poor among you, however, because the LORD is certain to bless you in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance--
05Dt 15:5 if only you obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow every one of these commands I am giving you today.
05Dt 15:6 When the LORD your God blesses you as He has promised you, you will lend to many nations but not borrow; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
05Dt 15:7 "If there is a poor person among you, one of your brothers within any of your gates in the land the LORD your God is giving you, you must not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother.
05Dt 15:8 Instead, you are to open your hand to him and freely loan him enough for whatever need he has.
05Dt 15:9 Be careful that there isn't this wicked thought in your heart, 'The seventh year, the year of canceling debts, is near,' and you are stingy toward your poor brother and give him [nothing]. He will cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty.
05Dt 15:10 Give to him, and don't have a stingy heart when you give, and because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you do.
05Dt 15:11 For there will never cease to be poor people in the land; that is why I am commanding you, 'You must willingly open your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land.'
05Dt 15:12 "If your fellow Hebrew, a man or woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, you must set him free in the seventh year.
05Dt 15:13 When you set him free, do not send him away empty-handed.
05Dt 15:14 Give generously to him from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. You are to give him whatever the LORD your God has blessed you with.
05Dt 15:15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you; that is why I am giving you this command today.
05Dt 15:16 But if your slave says to you, 'I don't want to leave you,' because he loves you and your family, and is well off with you,
05Dt 15:17 take an awl and pierce through his ear into the door, and he will become your slave for life. Also treat your female slave the same way.
05Dt 15:18 Do not regard it as a hardship when you set him free, because he worked for you six years-- worth twice the wages of a hired hand. Then the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.
05Dt 15:19 "You must consecrate to the LORD your God every firstborn male produced by your herd and flock. You are not to put the firstborn of your oxen to work or shear the firstborn of your flock.
05Dt 15:20 Each year you and your family are to eat it before the LORD your God in the place the LORD chooses.
05Dt 15:21 But if there is a defect in the animal, if it is lame or blind or has any serious defect, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
05Dt 15:22 Eat it within your gates; both the unclean person and the clean [may eat it], as though it were a gazelle or deer.
05Dt 15:23 But you must not eat its blood; pour it on the ground like water.
05Dt 16:1 "Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, because the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night in the month of Abib.
05Dt 16:2 Sacrifice to the LORD your God a Passover animal from the herd or flock in the place where the LORD chooses to have His name dwell.
05Dt 16:3 You must not eat leavened bread with it. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread with it, the bread of hardship-- because you left the land of Egypt in a hurry-- so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt.
05Dt 16:4 No yeast is to be found anywhere in your territory for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice in the evening of the first day is to remain until morning.
05Dt 16:5 You are not to sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:6 You must only sacrifice the Passover animal at the place where the LORD your God chooses to have His name dwell. [Do this] in the evening as the sun sets at the [same] time [of day] you departed from Egypt.
05Dt 16:7 You are to cook and eat [it] in the place the LORD your God chooses, and you are to return to your tents in the morning.
05Dt 16:8 You must eat unleavened bread for six days. On the seventh day there is to be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God, and you must not do any work.
05Dt 16:9 "You are to count seven weeks, counting the weeks from the time the sickle is first [put] to the standing grain.
05Dt 16:10 You are to celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill offering that you give in proportion to how the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 16:11 Rejoice before the LORD your God in the place where He chooses to have His name dwell-- you, your son and daughter, your male and female slave, the Levite within your gates, as well as the foreign resident, the fatherless, and the widow among you.
05Dt 16:12 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt; carefully follow these statutes.
05Dt 16:13 "You are to celebrate the Festival of Booths for seven days when you have gathered in [everything] from your threshing floor and winepress.
05Dt 16:14 Rejoice during your festival-- you, your son and daughter, your male and female slave, as well as the Levite, the foreign resident, the fatherless, and the widow within your gates.
05Dt 16:15 You are to hold a seven-day festival for the LORD your God in the place He chooses, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, and you will have abundant joy.
05Dt 16:16 "All your males are to appear three times a year before the LORD your God in the place He chooses: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. No one is to appear before the LORD empty-handed.
05Dt 16:17 Everyone [must appear] with a gift suited to his means, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 16:18 "Appoint judges and officials for your tribes in all your towns the LORD your God is giving you. They are to judge the people with righteous judgment.
05Dt 16:19 Do not deny justice or show partiality [to anyone]. Do not accept a bribe, for it blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
05Dt 16:20 Pursue justice and justice alone, so that you will live and possess the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:21 "Do not set up an Asherah of any kind of wood next to the altar you will build for the LORD your God,
05Dt 16:22 and do not set up a sacred pillar; the LORD your God hates them.
05Dt 17:1 "You must not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or sheep with a defect or any serious flaw, for that is detestable to the LORD your God.
05Dt 17:2 "If a man or woman among you in one of your towns that the LORD your God will give you is discovered doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God and violating His covenant
05Dt 17:3 and has gone to worship other gods by bowing down to the sun, moon, or all the stars in the sky-- which I have forbidden--
05Dt 17:4 and if you are told or hear [about it], you must investigate it thoroughly. If the report turns out to be true that this detestable thing has happened in Israel,
05Dt 17:5 you must bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done this evil thing and stone them to death.
05Dt 17:6 The one condemned to die is to be executed on the testimony of two or three witnesses. No one is to be executed on the testimony of a single witness.
05Dt 17:7 The witnesses' hands are to be the first in putting him to death, and after that, the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from you.
05Dt 17:8 "If a case is too difficult for you-- concerning bloodshed, lawsuits, or assaults-- cases disputed at your gates, you must go up to the place the LORD your God chooses.
05Dt 17:9 You are to go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who presides at that time. Ask, and they will give you a verdict in the case.
05Dt 17:10 You must abide by the verdict they give you at the place the LORD chooses. Be careful to do exactly as they instruct you.
05Dt 17:11 You must abide by the instruction they give you and the verdict they announce to you. Do not turn to the right or the left from the decision they declare to you.
05Dt 17:12 The person who acts arrogantly, refusing to listen either to the priest who stands there serving the LORD your God or to the judge, must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 17:13 Then all the people will hear [about it], be afraid, and no longer behave arrogantly.
05Dt 17:14 "When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, take possession of it, live in it, and say, 'We want to appoint a king over us like all the nations around us,'
05Dt 17:15 you are to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses. Appoint a king from your brothers. You are not to set a foreigner over you, or one who is not of your people.
05Dt 17:16 However, he must not acquire many horses for himself or send the people back to Egypt to acquire many horses, for the LORD has told you, 'You are never to go back that way again.'
05Dt 17:17 He must not acquire many wives for himself so that his heart won't go astray. He must not acquire very large amounts of silver and gold for himself.
05Dt 17:18 When he is seated on his royal throne, he is to write a copy of this instruction for himself on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
05Dt 17:19 It is to remain with him, and he is to read from it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to observe all the words of this instruction, and to do these statutes.
05Dt 17:20 Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen, he will not turn from this command to the right or the left, and he and his sons will continue ruling many years over Israel.
05Dt 18:1 "The Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, will have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They will eat the LORD's fire offerings; that is their inheritance.
05Dt 18:2 Although Levi has no inheritance among his brothers, the LORD is his inheritance, as He promised him.
05Dt 18:3 This is the priests' share from the people who offer a sacrifice, whether it is an ox, a sheep, or a goat; the priests are to be given the shoulder, jaws, and stomach.
05Dt 18:4 You are to give him the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first sheared [wool] of your flock.
05Dt 18:5 For the LORD your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD's name from now on.
05Dt 18:6 When a Levite leaves one of your towns where he lives in Israel and wants to go to the place the LORD chooses,
05Dt 18:7 he may serve in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who minister there in the presence of the LORD.
05Dt 18:8 They will eat equal portions besides what he has received from the sale of the family estate.
05Dt 18:9 "When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable customs of those nations.
05Dt 18:10 No one among you is to make his son or daughter pass through the fire, practice divination, tell fortunes, interpret omens, practice sorcery,
05Dt 18:11 cast spells, consult a medium or a familiar spirit, or inquire of the dead.
05Dt 18:12 Everyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and the LORD your God is driving out the nations before you because of these detestable things.
05Dt 18:13 You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
05Dt 18:14 Though these nations you are about to drive out listen to fortune-tellers and diviners, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do this.
05Dt 18:15 "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.
05Dt 18:16 This is what you requested from the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, 'Let us not continue to hear the voice of the LORD our God or see this great fire any longer, so that we will not die!'
05Dt 18:17 Then the LORD said to me, 'They have spoken well.
05Dt 18:18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
05Dt 18:19 I will hold accountable whoever does not listen to My words that he speaks in My name.
05Dt 18:20 But the prophet who dares to speak in My name a message I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods-- that prophet must die.'
05Dt 18:21 You may say to yourself, 'How can we recognize a message the LORD has not spoken?'
05Dt 18:22 When a prophet speaks in the LORD's name, and the message does not come true or is not fulfilled, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.
05Dt 19:1 "When the LORD your God annihilates the nations whose land He is giving you, so that you drive them out and live in their cities and houses,
05Dt 19:2 you are to set apart three cities for yourselves within the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:3 You are to determine the distances and divide the land the LORD your God is granting you as an inheritance into three regions, so that anyone who commits manslaughter can flee to these cities.
05Dt 19:4 "Here is the law concerning a case of someone who kills a person and flees there to save his life, having killed his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him:
05Dt 19:5 If he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings the ax to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies, that person may flee to one of these cities and live.
05Dt 19:6 Otherwise, the avenger of blood in the heat of his anger might pursue the one who committed manslaughter, overtake him because the distance is great, and strike him dead. Yet he did not deserve to die, since he did not previously hate his neighbor.
05Dt 19:7 This is why I am commanding you to set apart three cities for yourselves.
05Dt 19:8 If the LORD your God enlarges your territory as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land He promised to give them--
05Dt 19:9 provided you keep every one of these commands I am giving you today and follow them, loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at all times-- you are to add three more cities to these three.
05Dt 19:10 In this way, innocent blood will not be shed, and you will not become guilty of bloodshed in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 19:11 But if someone hates his neighbor, lies in ambush for him, attacks him, and strikes him fatally, and flees to one of these cities,
05Dt 19:12 the elders of his city must send [for him], take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood and he will die.
05Dt 19:13 You must not look on him with pity but purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and you will prosper.
05Dt 19:14 "You must not move your neighbor's boundary marker, established at the start in the inheritance you will receive in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:15 "One witness cannot establish any wrongdoing or sin against a person, whatever that person has done. A fact must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
05Dt 19:16 "If a malicious witness testifies against someone accusing him of a crime,
05Dt 19:17 the two people in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and judges in authority at the time.
05Dt 19:18 The judges are to make a careful investigation, and if the witness turns out to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother,
05Dt 19:19 you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from you.
05Dt 19:20 Then everyone else will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything evil like this among you.
05Dt 19:21 You must not show pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.
05Dt 20:1 "When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours, do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you.
05Dt 20:2 When you are about to engage in battle, the priest is to come forward and address the army.
05Dt 20:3 He is to say to them: 'Listen, Israel: Today you are about to engage in battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted. Do not be afraid, alarmed, or terrified because of them.
05Dt 20:4 For the LORD your God is the One who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.'
05Dt 20:5 "The officers are to address the army, 'Has any man built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him leave and return home. Otherwise, he may die in battle and another man dedicate it.
05Dt 20:6 Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy its fruit? Let him leave and return home. Otherwise he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit.
05Dt 20:7 Has any man become engaged to a woman and not married her? Let him leave and return home. Otherwise he may die in battle and another man marry her.'
05Dt 20:8 The officers will continue to address the army and say, 'Is there any man who is afraid or fainthearted? Let him leave and return home, so that his brothers' hearts won't melt like his own.'
05Dt 20:9 When the officers have finished addressing the army, they will appoint military commanders to lead it.
05Dt 20:10 "When you approach a city to fight against it, you must make an offer of peace.
05Dt 20:11 If it accepts your offer of peace and opens [its gates] to you, all the people found in it will become forced laborers for you and serve you.
05Dt 20:12 However, if it does not make peace with you but wages war against you, lay siege to it.
05Dt 20:13 When the LORD your God hands it over to you, you must strike down all its males with the sword.
05Dt 20:14 But you may take the women, children, animals, and whatever else is in the city-- all its spoil-- as plunder. You may enjoy the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 20:15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and are not among the cities of these nations.
05Dt 20:16 However, you must not let any living thing survive among the cities of these people the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 20:17 You must completely destroy them-- the Hittite, Amorite, Canaanite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite-- as the LORD your God has commanded you,
05Dt 20:18 so that they won't teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods, and you sin against the LORD your God.
05Dt 20:19 "When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can get food from them. You must not cut them down. Are trees of the field human, to come under siege by you?
05Dt 20:20 But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce food. You may cut them down to build siege works against the city that is waging war with you, until it falls.
05Dt 21:1 "If a murder victim is found lying in a field in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,
05Dt 21:2 your elders and judges must come out and measure [the distance] from the victim to the nearby cities.
05Dt 21:3 The elders of the city nearest to the victim are to get a cow that has not been yoked or used for work.
05Dt 21:4 The elders of that city will bring the cow down to a continually flowing stream, to a place not tilled or sown, and they will break the cow's neck there by the stream.
05Dt 21:5 Then the priests, the sons of Levi, will come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in the LORD's name, and they are to give a ruling in every dispute and [case of] assault.
05Dt 21:6 All the elders of the city nearest to the victim will wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken.
05Dt 21:7 They will declare, 'Our hands did not shed this blood; our eyes did not see [it].
05Dt 21:8 LORD, forgive Your people Israel You redeemed, and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.' Then they will be absolved of responsibility for bloodshed.
05Dt 21:9 You must purge from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, for you will be doing what is right in the LORD's sight.
05Dt 21:10 "When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God hands them over to you and you take some of them prisoner, and
05Dt 21:11 if you see a beautiful woman among the captives, desire her, and want to take her as your wife,
05Dt 21:12 you are to bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,
05Dt 21:13 remove the clothes she was wearing when she was taken prisoner, live in your house, and mourn for her father and mother a full month. After that, you may have sexual relations with her and be her husband, and she will be your wife.
05Dt 21:14 Then if you are not satisfied with her, you are to let her go where she wants, but you must not sell her for money or treat her as merchandise, because you have humiliated her.
05Dt 21:15 "If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved bear him sons, and if the unloved wife has the firstborn son,
05Dt 21:16 when that man gives what he has to his sons as an inheritance, he is not to show favoritism to the son of the loved [wife] as his firstborn over the firstborn of the unloved wife.
05Dt 21:17 He must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of everything that belongs to him, for he is the firstfruits of his virility; he has the rights of the firstborn.
05Dt 21:18 "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father or mother and doesn't listen to them even after they discipline him,
05Dt 21:19 his father and mother must take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown.
05Dt 21:20 They will say to the elders of his city, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn't obey us. He's a glutton and a drunkard.'
05Dt 21:21 Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid.
05Dt 21:22 "If anyone is found guilty of an offense deserving the death penalty and is executed, and you hang his body on a tree,
05Dt 21:23 you are not to leave his corpse on the tree overnight but are to bury him that day, for anyone hung [on a tree] is under God's curse. You must not defile the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 22:1 "If you see your brother's ox or sheep straying, you must not ignore it; make sure you return it to your brother.

05Dt 22:18 Then the elders of that city will take the man and punish him.
05Dt 22:19 They will also fine him 100 silver [shekels] and give [them] to the young woman's father, because that man gave an Israelite virgin a bad name. She will remain his wife; he cannot divorce her as long as he lives.

05Dt 22:21 they will bring the woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father's house. You must purge the evil from you.

05Dt 22:24 you must take the two of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death-- the young woman because she did not cry out in the city and the man because he has violated his neighbor's fianc?. You must purge the evil from you.
05Dt 22:25 But if the man encounters the engaged woman in the open country, and he seizes and rapes her, only the man who raped her must die.
05Dt 22:26 Do nothing to the young woman, because she is not guilty of an offense deserving death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him.

05Dt 22:28 If a man encounters a young woman, a virgin who is not engaged, takes hold of her and rapes her, and they are discovered,

05Dt 23:3 No Ammonite or Moabite may enter the LORD's assembly; none of their descendants, even to the tenth generation, may ever enter the LORD's assembly.

05Dt 28:47 Because you didn't serve the LORD your God with joy and a cheerful heart, even though [you had] an abundance of everything,
05Dt 28:48 you will serve your enemies the LORD will send against you, in famine, thirst, nakedness, and a lack of everything. He will place an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.
05Dt 28:49 The LORD will bring a nation from far away, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down on you like an eagle, a nation whose language you don't understand,
05Dt 28:50 a ruthless nation, showing no respect for the old and not sparing the young.
05Dt 28:51 They will eat the offspring of your livestock and your soil's produce until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine, oil, young of your herds, or newborn of your flocks until they cause you to perish.
05Dt 28:52 They will besiege you within all your gates until your high and fortified walls, that you trust in, come down throughout your land. They will besiege you within all your gates throughout the land the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 28:53 "You will eat your children, the flesh of your sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you.
05Dt 28:54 The most sensitive and refined man among you will look grudgingly at his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children,
05Dt 28:55 refusing to share with any of them his children's flesh that he will eat because he has nothing left during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you in all your towns.
05Dt 28:56 The most sensitive and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her refinement and sensitivity, will begrudge the husband she embraces, her son, and her daughter,
05Dt 28:57 the afterbirth that comes out from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything [else] during the siege and hardship your enemy imposes on you within your gates.
05Dt 28:58 "If you are not careful to obey all the words of this law, which are written in this scroll, by fearing this glorious and awesome name-- Yahweh, your God--
05Dt 28:59 He will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses.
05Dt 28:60 He will afflict you again with all the diseases of Egypt, which you dreaded, and they will cling to you.
05Dt 28:61 The LORD will also inflict you with every sickness and plague not recorded in the book of this law, until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:62 Though you were as numerous as the stars of the sky, you will be left with only a few people, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
05Dt 28:63 Just as the LORD was glad to cause you to prosper and to multiply you, so He will also be glad to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be deported from the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 28:64 Then the LORD will scatter you among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
05Dt 28:65 You will find no peace among those nations, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despondent spirit.
05Dt 28:66 Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be in dread night and day, never certain of survival.
05Dt 28:67 In the morning you will say, 'If only it were evening!' and in the evening you will say, 'If only it were morning!'-- because of the dread you will have in your heart and because of what you will see.
05Dt 28:68 The LORD will take you back in ships to Egypt by a route that I said you would never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy [you]."
05Dt 29:1  These are the words of the covenant the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb.
05Dt 29:2  Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to his entire land.
05Dt 29:3 You saw with your own eyes the great trials and those great signs and wonders.
05Dt 29:4 Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear.
05Dt 29:5 I led you 40 years in the wilderness; your clothes and the sandals on your feet did not wear out;
05Dt 29:6 you did not eat bread or drink wine or beer-- so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
05Dt 29:7 When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them.
05Dt 29:8 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
05Dt 29:9 Therefore, observe the words of this covenant and follow them, so that you will succeed in everything you do.
05Dt 29:10 "All of you are standing today before the LORD your God-- your leaders, tribes, elders, officials, all the men of Israel,
05Dt 29:11 your children, your wives, and the foreigners in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water--
05Dt 29:12 so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, which He is making with you today, so that you may enter into His oath
05Dt 29:13 and so that He may establish you today as His people and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05Dt 29:14 I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you,
05Dt 29:15 but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God and with those who are not here today.
05Dt 29:16 "Indeed, you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and passed through the nations where you traveled.
05Dt 29:17 You saw their detestable images and idols [made] of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them.
05Dt 29:18 Be sure there is no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Be sure there is no root among you bearing poisonous and bitter fruit.
05Dt 29:19 When someone hears the words of this oath, he may bless himself in his mind, thinking, 'I will have peace even though I follow my [own] stubborn heart.' This will lead to the destruction of the well-watered [land] as well as the dry [land].
05Dt 29:20 The LORD will not be willing to forgive him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that person, and every curse written in this scroll will descend on him. The LORD will blot out his name under heaven,
05Dt 29:21 and single him out for harm from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.
05Dt 29:22 "Future generations of your children who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant country will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it.
05Dt 29:23 All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown, producing nothing, with no plant growing on it, just like the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD demolished in His fierce anger.
05Dt 29:24 All the nations will ask, 'Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?'
05Dt 29:25 Then people will answer, 'It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He had made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
05Dt 29:26 They began to worship other gods, bowing down to gods they had not known-- gods that the LORD had not permitted them [to worship].
05Dt 29:27 Therefore the LORD's anger burned against this land, and He brought every curse written in this book on it.
05Dt 29:28 The LORD uprooted them from their land in [His] anger, fury, and great wrath, and threw them into another land where they are today.'
05Dt 29:29 The hidden things belong to the LORD our God, but the revealed things belong to us and our children forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law.
05Dt 30:1 "When all these things happen to you-- the blessings and curses I have set before you-- and you come to your senses [while you are] in all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you,
05Dt 30:2 and you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and all your soul by doing everything I am giving you today,
05Dt 30:3 then He will restore your fortunes, have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.
05Dt 30:4 Even if your exiles are at the ends of the earth, He will gather you and bring you back from there.
05Dt 30:5 The LORD your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply you more than [He did] your fathers.
05Dt 30:6 The LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love Him with all your heart and all your soul, so that you will live.
05Dt 30:7 The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.
05Dt 30:8 Then you will again obey Him and follow all His commands I am giving you today.
05Dt 30:9 The LORD your God will make you prosper abundantly in all the work of your hands with children, the offspring of your livestock, and your soil's produce. Indeed, the LORD will again delight in your prosperity, as He delighted in that of your fathers,
05Dt 30:10 when you obey the LORD your God by keeping His commands and statutes that are written in this book of the law and return to Him with all your heart and all your soul.
05Dt 30:11 "This command that I give you today is certainly not too difficult or beyond your reach.
05Dt 30:12 It is not in heaven, so that you have to ask, 'Who will go up to heaven, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?'
05Dt 30:13 And it is not across the sea, so that you have to ask, 'Who will cross the sea, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?'
05Dt 30:14 But the message is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may follow it.
05Dt 30:15 See, today I have set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity.
05Dt 30:16 For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commands, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and multiply, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 30:17 But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are led astray to bow down to other gods and worship them,
05Dt 30:18 I tell you today that you will certainly perish and will not live long in the land you are entering to possess across the Jordan.
05Dt 30:19 I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live,
05Dt 30:20 love the LORD your God, obey Him, and remain faithful to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land the LORD swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
05Dt 31:1 Then Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel,
05Dt 31:2 saying, "I am now 120 years old; I can no longer act as your leader. The LORD has told me, 'You will not cross this Jordan.'
05Dt 31:3 The LORD your God is the One who will cross ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will drive them out. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said.
05Dt 31:4 The LORD will deal with them as He did Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land when He destroyed them.
05Dt 31:5 The LORD will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you.
05Dt 31:6 Be strong and courageous; don't be terrified or afraid of them. For it is the LORD your God who goes with you; He will not leave you or forsake you."
05Dt 31:7 Moses then summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land the LORD swore to give to their fathers. You will enable them to take possession of it.
05Dt 31:8 The LORD is the One who will go before you. He will be with you; He will not leave you or forsake you. Do not be afraid or discouraged."
05Dt 31:9 Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the LORD's covenant, and to all the elders of Israel.
05Dt 31:10 Moses commanded them, "At the end of [every] seven years, at the appointed time in the year of debt cancellation, during the Festival of Booths,
05Dt 31:11 when all Israel assembles in the presence of the LORD your God at the place He chooses, you are to read this law aloud before all Israel.
05Dt 31:12 Gather the people-- men, women, children, and foreigners living within your gates-- so that they may listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and be careful to follow all the words of this law.
05Dt 31:13 Then their children who do not know [the law] will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 31:14 The LORD said to Moses, "The time of your death is now approaching. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him." When Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting,
05Dt 31:15 the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood at the entrance to the tent.
05Dt 31:16 The LORD said to Moses, "You are about to rest with your fathers, and this people will soon commit adultery with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will abandon Me and break the covenant I have made with them.
05Dt 31:17 My anger will burn against them on that day; I will abandon them and hide My face from them so that they will become easy prey. Many troubles and afflictions will come to them. On that day they will say, 'Haven't these troubles come to us because our God is no longer with us?'
05Dt 31:18 I will certainly hide My face on that day because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
05Dt 31:19 Therefore write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites; have them recite it, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the Israelites.
05Dt 31:20 When I bring them into the land I swore to [give] their fathers, [a land] flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. They will turn to other gods and worship them, despising Me and breaking My covenant.
05Dt 31:21 And when many troubles and afflictions come to them, this song will testify against them, because their descendants will not have forgotten it. For I know what they are prone to do, even before I bring them into the land I swore [to give them]."
05Dt 31:22 So Moses wrote down this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites.
05Dt 31:23 The LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun, "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I swore to them, and I will be with you."
05Dt 31:24 When Moses had finished writing down on a scroll every single word of this law,
05Dt 31:25 he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the LORD's covenant,
05Dt 31:26 "Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you.
05Dt 31:27 For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are rebelling against the LORD now, while I am still alive, how much more [will you rebel] after I am dead!
05Dt 31:28 Assemble all your tribal elders and officers before me, so that I may speak these words directly to them and call heaven and earth as witnesses against them.
05Dt 31:29 For I know that after my death you will become completely corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. Disaster will come to you in the future, because you will do what is evil in the LORD's sight, infuriating Him with what your hands have made."
05Dt 31:30 Then Moses recited aloud every single word of this song to the entire assembly of Israel:
05Dt 32:1 Pay attention, heavens, and I will speak; listen, earth, to the words of my mouth.
05Dt 32:2 Let my teaching fall like rain and my word settle like dew, like gentle rain on new grass and showers on tender plants.
05Dt 32:3 For I will proclaim the LORD's name. Declare the greatness of our God!
05Dt 32:4 The Rock-- His work is perfect; all His ways are entirely just. A faithful God, without prejudice, He is righteous and true.
05Dt 32:5 His people have acted corruptly toward Him; this is their defect-- they are not His children but a devious and crooked generation.
05Dt 32:6 Is this how you repay the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Isn't He your Father and Creator? Didn't He make you and sustain you?
05Dt 32:7 Remember the days of old; consider the years long past. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will teach you.
05Dt 32:8 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance and divided the human race, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the people of Israel.
05Dt 32:9 But the LORD's portion is His people, Jacob, His own inheritance.
05Dt 32:10 He found him in a desolate land, in a barren, howling wilderness; He surrounded him, cared for him, and guarded him as the pupil of His eye.
05Dt 32:11 He watches over His nest like an eagle and hovers over His young; He spreads His wings, catches him, and lifts him up on His pinions.
05Dt 32:12 The LORD alone led him, with no help from a foreign god.
05Dt 32:13 He made him ride on the heights of the land and eat the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from flintlike rock,
05Dt 32:14 cream from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs, rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat; you drank wine from the finest grapes.
05Dt 32:15 Then Jeshurun became fat and rebelled-- you became fat, bloated, and gorged. He abandoned the God who made him and scorned the Rock of his salvation.
05Dt 32:16 They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods; they enraged Him with detestable practices.
05Dt 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods they had not known, new gods that had just arrived, which your fathers did not fear.
05Dt 32:18 You ignored the Rock who gave you birth; you forgot the God who brought you forth.
05Dt 32:19 When the LORD saw [this], He despised [them], provoked [to anger] by His sons and daughters.
05Dt 32:20 He said: "I will hide My face from them; I will see what will become of them, for they are a perverse generation-- unfaithful children.
05Dt 32:21 They have provoked My jealousy with [their] so-called gods; they have enraged Me with their worthless idols. So I will provoke their jealousy with an inferior people; I will enrage them with a foolish nation.
05Dt 32:22 For fire has been kindled because of My anger and burns to the depths of Sheol; it devours the land and its produce, and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
05Dt 32:23 I will pile disasters on them; I will use up My arrows against them.
05Dt 32:24 They will be weak from hunger, ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague; I will unleash on them wild beasts with fangs, as well as venomous snakes that slither in the dust.
05Dt 32:25 Outside, the sword will take their children, and inside, there will be terror; the young man and the virgin [will be killed], the infant and the gray-haired man.
05Dt 32:26 I would have said: I will cut them to pieces and blot out the memory of them from mankind,
05Dt 32:27 if I had not feared insult from the enemy, [or feared] that these foes might misunderstand and say: Our own hand has prevailed; it wasn't the LORD who did all this."
05Dt 32:28 Israel is a nation lacking sense with no understanding at all.
05Dt 32:29 If only they were wise, they would figure it out; they would understand their fate.
05Dt 32:30 How could one man pursue a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?
05Dt 32:31 But their "rock" is not like our Rock; even our enemies concede.
05Dt 32:32 For their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters are bitter.
05Dt 32:33 Their wine is serpents' venom, the deadly poison of cobras.
05Dt 32:34 "Is it not stored up with Me, sealed up in My vaults?
05Dt 32:35 Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay. In time their foot will slip, for their day of disaster is near, and their doom is coming quickly."
05Dt 32:36 The LORD will indeed vindicate His people and have compassion on His servants when He sees that [their] strength is gone and no one is left-- slave or free.
05Dt 32:37 He will say: "Where are their gods, the 'rock' they found refuge in?
05Dt 32:38 Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let it be a shelter for you.
05Dt 32:39 See now that I alone am He; there is no God but Me. I bring death and I give life; I wound and I heal. No one can rescue [anyone] from My hand.
05Dt 32:40 I raise My hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,
05Dt 32:41 when I sharpen My flashing sword, and My hand takes hold of judgment, I will take vengeance on My adversaries and repay those who hate Me.
05Dt 32:42 I will make My arrows drunk with blood while My sword devours flesh-- the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders."
05Dt 32:43 Rejoice, you nations, over His people, for He will avenge the blood of His servants. He will take vengeance on His adversaries; He will purify His land and His people.
05Dt 32:44 Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the presence of the people.
05Dt 32:45 After Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
05Dt 32:46 he said to them, "Take to heart all these words I am giving as a warning to you today, so that you may command your children to carefully follow all the words of this law.
05Dt 32:47 For they are not meaningless words to you but they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 32:48 On that same day the LORD spoke to Moses,
05Dt 32:49 "Go up Mount Nebo in the Abarim [range] in the land of Moab, across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan I am giving the Israelites as a possession.
05Dt 32:50 Then you will die on the mountain that you go up, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
05Dt 32:51 For [both of] you broke faith with Me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence.
05Dt 32:52 Although you will view the land from a distance, which I am giving the Israelites, you will not go there."
05Dt 33:1 This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave the Israelites before his death.
05Dt 33:2 He said: The LORD came from Sinai and appeared to them from Seir; He shone [on them] from Mount Paran and came with ten thousand holy ones, with lightning from His right hand for them.
05Dt 33:3 Indeed He loves the people. All Your holy ones are in Your hand, and they assemble at Your feet. Each receives Your words.
05Dt 33:4 Moses gave us instruction, a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
05Dt 33:5 So He became King in Jeshurun when the leaders of the people gathered with the tribes of Israel.
05Dt 33:6 Let Reuben live and not die though his people become few.
05Dt 33:7 He said this about Judah: LORD, hear Judah's cry and bring him to his people. He fights for his cause with his own hands, but may You be a help against his foes.
05Dt 33:8 He said about Levi: Your Thummim and Urim belong to Your faithful one; You tested him at Massah and contended with him at the waters of Meribah.
05Dt 33:9 He said about his father and mother, "I do not regard them." He disregarded his brothers and didn't acknowledge his sons, for they kept Your word and maintained Your covenant.
05Dt 33:10 They will teach Your ordinances to Jacob and Your instruction to Israel; they will set incense before You and whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
05Dt 33:11 LORD, bless his possessions, and accept the work of his hands. Smash the loins of his adversaries and enemies, so that they cannot rise again.
05Dt 33:12 He said about Benjamin: The LORD's beloved rests securely on Him. He shields him all day long, and he rests on His shoulders.
05Dt 33:13 He said about Joseph: May his land be blessed by the LORD with the dew of heaven's bounty and the watery depths that lie beneath;
05Dt 33:14 with the bountiful harvest from the sun and the abundant yield of the seasons;
05Dt 33:15 with the best products of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the eternal hills;
05Dt 33:16 with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it; and with the favor of Him who appeared in the [burning] bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince of his brothers.
05Dt 33:17 His firstborn bull has splendor, and horns like those of a wild ox; he gores all the peoples with them to the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and such are the thousands of Manasseh.
05Dt 33:18 He said about Zebulun: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents.
05Dt 33:19 They summon the peoples to a mountain; there they offer acceptable sacrifices. For they draw from the wealth of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.
05Dt 33:20 He said about Gad: The one who enlarges Gad's [territory] will be blessed. He lies down like a lion and tears off an arm or even a head.
05Dt 33:21 He chose the best [part] for himself, because a ruler's portion was assigned there for him. He came [with] the leaders of the people; he carried out the LORD's justice and His ordinances for Israel.
05Dt 33:22 He said about Dan: Dan is a young lion, leaping out of Bashan.
05Dt 33:23 He said about Naphtali: Naphtali, enjoying approval, full of the LORD's blessing, take possession to the west and the south.
05Dt 33:24 He said about Asher: May Asher be the most blessed of the sons; may he be the most favored among his brothers and dip his foot in [olive] oil.
05Dt 33:25 May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze, and your strength last as long as you live.
05Dt 33:26 There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your aid on the clouds in His majesty.
05Dt 33:27 The God of old is [your] dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drives out the enemy before you, and commands, "Destroy!"
05Dt 33:28 So Israel dwells securely; Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and new wine; even his skies drip with dew.
05Dt 33:29 How happy you are, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is the shield that protects you, the sword you boast in. Your enemies will cringe before you, and you will tread on their backs.
05Dt 34:1 Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho, and the LORD showed him all the land: Gilead as far as Dan,
05Dt 34:2 all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea,
05Dt 34:3 the Negev, and the region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.
05Dt 34:4 The LORD then said to him, "This is the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it."
05Dt 34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said.
05Dt 34:6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows where his grave is.
05Dt 34:7 Moses was 120 years old when he died; his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not left [him].
05Dt 34:8 The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab 30 days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
05Dt 34:9 Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
05Dt 34:10 No prophet has arisen again in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.
05Dt 34:11 [He was unparalleled] for all the signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do against the land of Egypt-- to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land,
05Dt 34:12 and for all the mighty [acts of] power and terrifying deeds that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.

06Jos 1:1 After the death of Moses the LORD's servant, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, who had served Moses:
06Jos 1:2 "Moses My servant is dead. Now you and all the people prepare to cross over the Jordan to the land I am giving the Israelites.
06Jos 1:3 I have given you every place where the sole of your foot treads, just as I promised Moses.
06Jos 1:4 Your territory will be from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great Euphrates River-- all the land of the Hittites-- and west to the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 1:5 No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. I will be with you, just as I was with Moses. I will not leave you or forsake you.
06Jos 1:6 "Be strong and courageous, for you will distribute the land I swore to their fathers to give them as an inheritance.
06Jos 1:7 Above all, be strong and very courageous to carefully observe the whole instruction My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or the left, so that you will have success wherever you go.
06Jos 1:8 This book of instruction must not depart from your mouth; you are to recite it day and night, so that you may carefully observe everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do.
06Jos 1:9 Haven't I commanded you: be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
06Jos 1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:
06Jos 1:11 "Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get provisions ready for yourselves, for within three days you will be crossing the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you to inherit.'"
06Jos 1:12 Joshua said to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh:
06Jos 1:13 "Remember what Moses the LORD's servant commanded you when he said, 'The LORD your God will give you rest, and He will give you this land.'
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, young children, and livestock may remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But your fighting men must cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers and help them
06Jos 1:15 until the LORD gives our brothers rest, as [He has given] you, and they too possess the land the LORD your God is giving them. You may then return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of what Moses the LORD's servant gave you on the east side of the Jordan."
06Jos 1:16 They answered Joshua, "Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go.
06Jos 1:17 We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.
06Jos 1:18 Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words in all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!"
06Jos 2:1 Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men as spies from Acacia Grove, saying, "Go and scout the land, especially Jericho." So they left, and they came to the house of a woman, a prostitute named Rahab, and stayed there.
06Jos 2:2 The king of Jericho was told, "Look, some of the Israelite men have come here tonight to investigate the land."
06Jos 2:3 Then the king of Jericho sent [word] to Rahab and said, "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, for they came to investigate the entire land."
06Jos 2:4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. So she said, "Yes, the men did come to me, but I didn't know where they were from.
06Jos 2:5 At nightfall, when the gate was about to close, the men went out, and I don't know where they were going. Chase after them quickly, and you can catch up with them!"
06Jos 2:6 But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she had arranged on the roof.
06Jos 2:7 The men pursued them along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they left to pursue them, the gate was shut.
06Jos 2:8 Before the men fell asleep, she went up on the roof
06Jos 2:9 and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given you this land and that dread of you has fallen on us, and everyone who lives in the land is panicking because of you.
06Jos 2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings you completely destroyed across the Jordan.
06Jos 2:11 When we heard this, we lost heart, and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.
06Jos 2:12 Now please swear to me by the LORD that you will also show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
06Jos 2:13 that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death."
06Jos 2:14 The men answered her, "[We will give] our lives for yours. If you don't report our mission, we will show kindness and faithfulness to you when the LORD gives us the land."
06Jos 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, since she lived in a house that was [built] into the wall of the city.
06Jos 2:16 "Go to the hill country so that the men pursuing you won't find you," she said to them. "Hide yourselves there for three days until they return; afterwards, go on your way."
06Jos 2:17 The men said to her, "We will be free from this oath you made us swear,
06Jos 2:18 unless, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet cord to the window through which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your father's family into your house.
06Jos 2:19 If anyone goes out the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone with you in the house should be harmed, his blood will be on our heads.
06Jos 2:20 And if you report our mission, we are free from the oath you made us swear."
06Jos 2:21 "Let it be as you say," she replied, and she sent them away. After they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord to the window.
06Jos 2:22 So the two men went into the hill country and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. They searched all along the way, but did not find them.
06Jos 2:23 Then the men returned, came down from the hill country, and crossed [the Jordan]. They went to Joshua son of Nun and reported everything that had happened to them.
06Jos 2:24 They told Joshua, "The LORD has handed over the entire land to us. Everyone who lives in the land is also panicking because of us."
06Jos 3:1 Joshua started early the next morning and left Acacia Grove with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan and stayed there before crossing.
06Jos 3:2 After three days the officers went through the camp
06Jos 3:3 and commanded the people: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God carried by the Levitical priests, you must break camp and follow it.
06Jos 3:4 But keep a distance of about 1,000 yards between yourselves and the ark. Don't go near it, so that you can see the way to go, for you haven't traveled this way before."
06Jos 3:5 Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, because the LORD will do wonders among you tomorrow."
06Jos 3:6 Then he said to the priests, "Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people." So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.
06Jos 3:7 The LORD spoke to Joshua: "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they will know that I will be with you just as I was with Moses.
06Jos 3:8 Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: 'When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.'"
06Jos 3:9 Then Joshua told the Israelites, "Come closer and listen to the words of the LORD your God."
06Jos 3:10 He said, "You will know that the living God is among you and that He will certainly dispossess before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites
06Jos 3:11 when the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth goes ahead of you into the Jordan.
06Jos 3:12 Now choose 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
06Jos 3:13 When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the Jordan's waters, its waters will be cut off. The water flowing downstream will stand up [in] a mass."
06Jos 3:14 When the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of the people.
06Jos 3:15 Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan, their feet touched the water at its edge
06Jos 3:16 and the water flowing downstream stood still, rising up [in] a mass that extended as far as Adam, a city next to Zarethan. The water flowing downstream into the Sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea) was completely cut off, and the people crossed opposite Jericho.
06Jos 3:17 The priests carrying the ark of the LORD's covenant stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry ground until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
06Jos 4:1 After the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua,
06Jos 4:2 "Choose 12 men from the people, one man for each tribe,
06Jos 4:3 and command them, 'Take 12 stones from this place in the middle of the Jordan where the priests' feet are standing, carry them with you, and set them down at the place where you spend the night.'"
06Jos 4:4 So Joshua summoned the 12 men selected from the Israelites, one man for each tribe,
06Jos 4:5 and said to them, "Go across to the ark of the LORD your God in the middle of the Jordan. Each of you lift a stone onto his shoulder, one for each of the Israelite tribes,
06Jos 4:6 so that this will be a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean to you?'
06Jos 4:7 you should tell them, 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off in front of the ark of the LORD's covenant. When it crossed the Jordan, the Jordan's waters were cut off.' Therefore these stones will always be a memorial for the Israelites."
06Jos 4:8 The Israelites did just as Joshua had commanded them. The 12 men took stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each of the Israelite tribes, just as the LORD had told Joshua. They carried them to the camp and set them down there.
06Jos 4:9 Joshua also set up 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing. The stones are there to this day.
06Jos 4:10 The priests carrying the ark continued standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell the people, in keeping with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried across,
06Jos 4:11 and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people.
06Jos 4:12 The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh went in battle formation in front of the Israelites, as Moses had instructed them.
06Jos 4:13 About 40,000 equipped for war crossed to the plains of Jericho in the LORD's presence.
06Jos 4:14 On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him throughout his life, as they had revered Moses.
06Jos 4:15 The LORD told Joshua,
06Jos 4:16 "Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to come up from the Jordan."
06Jos 4:17 So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up from the Jordan."
06Jos 4:18 When the priests carrying the ark of the LORD's covenant came up from the middle of the Jordan, and their feet stepped out on solid ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course, flowing over all the banks as before.
06Jos 4:19 The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and camped at Gilgal on the eastern limits of Jericho.
06Jos 4:20 Then Joshua set up in Gilgal the 12 stones they had taken from the Jordan,
06Jos 4:21 and he said to the Israelites, "When your children ask their fathers in the future, 'What is the meaning of these stones?'
06Jos 4:22 you should tell your children, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'
06Jos 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.
06Jos 4:24 This is so that all the people of the earth may know that the LORD's hand is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God."
06Jos 5:1 When all the Amorite kings across the Jordan to the west and all the Canaanite kings near the sea heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, they lost heart and their courage failed because of the Israelites.
06Jos 5:2 At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelite men again."
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelite men at Gibeath-haaraloth.
06Jos 5:4 This is the reason Joshua circumcised [them]: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males-- all the men of war-- had died in the wilderness along the way after they had come out of Egypt.
06Jos 5:5 Though all the people who came out were circumcised, none of the people born in the wilderness along the way were circumcised after they had come out of Egypt.
06Jos 5:6 For the Israelites wandered in the wilderness 40 years until all the nation's men of war who came out of Egypt had died off because they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06Jos 5:7 Joshua raised up their sons in their place; it was these he circumcised. They were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way.
06Jos 5:8 After the entire nation had been circumcised, they stayed where they were in the camp until they recovered.
06Jos 5:9 The LORD then said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you." Therefore, that place has been called Gilgal to this day.
06Jos 5:10 While the Israelites camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month.
06Jos 5:11 The day after Passover they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
06Jos 5:12 And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. Since there was no more manna for the Israelites, they ate from the crops of the land of Canaan that year.
06Jos 5:13 When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, "Are You for us or for our enemies?"
06Jos 5:14 "Neither," He replied. "I have now come as commander of the LORD's army." Then Joshua bowed with his face to the ground in worship and asked Him, "What does my Lord want to say to His servant?"
06Jos 5:15 The commander of the LORDS's army said to Joshua, "Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
06Jos 6:1 Now Jericho was strongly fortified because of the Israelites-- no one leaving or entering.
06Jos 6:2 The LORD said to Joshua, "Look, I have handed Jericho, its king, and its fighting men over to you.
06Jos 6:3 March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days.
06Jos 6:4 Have seven priests carry seven ram's-horn trumpets in front of the ark. But on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets.
06Jos 6:5 When there is a prolonged blast of the horn and you hear its sound, have all the people give a mighty shout. Then the city wall will collapse, and the people will advance, each man straight ahead."
06Jos 6:6 So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven trumpets in front of the ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:7 He said to the people, "Move forward, march around the city, and have the armed troops go ahead of the ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:8 After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven trumpets before the LORD moved forward and blew the trumpets; the ark of the LORD's covenant followed them.
06Jos 6:9 While the trumpets were blowing, the armed troops went in front of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard went behind the ark.
06Jos 6:10 But Joshua had commanded the people: "Do not shout or let your voice be heard. Don't let one word come out of your mouth until the time I say, 'Shout!' Then you are to shout."
06Jos 6:11 So the ark of the LORD was carried around the city, circling it once. They returned to the camp and spent the night there.
06Jos 6:12 Joshua got up early the next morning. The priests took the ark of the LORD,
06Jos 6:13 and the seven priests carrying seven trumpets marched in front of the ark of the LORD. While the trumpets were blowing, the armed troops went in front of them, and the rear guard went behind the ark of the LORD.
06Jos 6:14 On the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
06Jos 6:15 Early on the seventh day, they started at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same way. That was the only day they marched around the city seven times.
06Jos 6:16 After the seventh time, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.
06Jos 6:17 But the city and everything in it are set apart to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone with her in the house will live, because she hid the men we sent.
06Jos 6:18 But keep yourselves from the things set apart, or you will be set apart for destruction. If you take any of those things, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster on it.
06Jos 6:19 For all the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, are dedicated to the LORD and must go into the LORD's treasury."
06Jos 6:20 So the people shouted, and the trumpets sounded. When they heard the blast of the trumpet, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. The people advanced into the city, each man straight ahead, and they captured the city.
06Jos 6:21 They completely destroyed everything in the city with the sword-- every man and woman, both young and old, and every ox, sheep, and donkey.
06Jos 6:22 Joshua said to the two men who had scouted the land, "Go to the prostitute's house and bring the woman out of there, and all who are with her, just as you promised her."
06Jos 6:23 So the young men who had scouted went in and brought out Rahab and her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:24 They burned up the city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house.
06Jos 6:25 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho, and she lives in Israel to this day.
06Jos 6:26 At that time Joshua imposed this curse: Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes the rebuilding of this city, Jericho. He will lay its foundation [at the cost of] his firstborn; He will set up its gates [at the cost of] his youngest.
06Jos 6:27 And the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
06Jos 7:1 The Israelites, however, were unfaithful regarding the things set apart for destruction. Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart, and the LORD's anger burned against the Israelites.
06Jos 7:2 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and scout the land." So the men went up and scouted Ai.
06Jos 7:3 After returning to Joshua they reported to him, "Don't send all the people, but send about 2,000 or 3,000 men to attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, don't wear out all our people there."
06Jos 7:4 So about 3,000 men went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai.
06Jos 7:5 The men of Ai struck down about 36 of them and chased them from outside the gate to the quarries, striking them down on the descent. As a result, the people's hearts melted and became like water.
06Jos 7:6 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell before the ark of the LORD with his face to the ground until evening, as did the elders of Israel; they all put dust on their heads.
06Jos 7:7 "Oh, Lord God," Joshua said, "why did You ever bring these people across the Jordan to hand us over to the Amorites for our destruction? If only we had been content to remain on the other side of the Jordan!
06Jos 7:8 What can I say, Lord, now that Israel has turned its back [and run] from its enemies?
06Jos 7:9 When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will You do about Your great name?"
06Jos 7:10 The LORD then said to Joshua, "Stand up! Why are you on the ground?
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned. They have violated My covenant that I appointed for them. They have taken some of what was set apart. They have stolen, deceived, and put [the things] with their own belongings.
06Jos 7:12 This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs [and run] from their enemies, because they have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with you unless you remove from you what is set apart.
06Jos 7:13 "Go and consecrate the people. Tell them to consecrate themselves tomorrow, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'There are among you, Israel, things set apart. You will not be able to stand against your enemies until you remove what is set apart.
06Jos 7:14 In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the LORD selects is to come forward clan by clan. The clan the LORD selects is to come forward family by family. The family the LORD selects is to come forward man by man.
06Jos 7:15 The one who is caught with the things set apart must be burned, along with everything he has, because he has violated the LORD's covenant and committed an outrage in Israel.'"
06Jos 7:16 Joshua got up early the next morning. He had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
06Jos 7:17 He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the Zerahite clan was selected. He had the Zerahite clan come forward by heads of families, and Zabdi was selected.
06Jos 7:18 He then had Zabdi's family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
06Jos 7:19 So Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you, tell me what you have done. Don't hide anything from me."
06Jos 7:20 Achan replied to Joshua, "It is true. I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did:
06Jos 7:21 When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Babylon, 200 silver shekels, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, I coveted them and took them. You can see for yourself. They are concealed in the ground inside my tent, with the money under the cloak."
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there was the cloak, concealed in his tent, with the money underneath.
06Jos 7:23 They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out in the LORD's presence.
06Jos 7:24 Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, and the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his ox, donkey, and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
06Jos 7:25 Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? Today the LORD will trouble you!" So all Israel stoned him to death. They burned their bodies, threw stones on them,
06Jos 7:26 and raised over him a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from His burning anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.
06Jos 8:1 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the whole military force with you and go attack Ai. Look, I have handed over to you the king of Ai, his people, city, and land.
06Jos 8:2 Treat Ai and its king as you did Jericho and its king; you may plunder its spoil and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."
06Jos 8:3 So Joshua and the whole military force set out to attack Ai. Joshua selected 30,000 fighting men and sent them out at night.
06Jos 8:4 He commanded them: "Pay attention. Lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it, and all of you be ready.
06Jos 8:5 Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them.
06Jos 8:6 They will come after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are fleeing from us as before.' While we are fleeing from them,
06Jos 8:7 you are to come out of your ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God has handed it over to you.
06Jos 8:8 After taking the city, set it on fire. Follow the LORD's command-- see [that you do] as I have ordered you."
06Jos 8:9 So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the ambush site and waited between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But he spent that night with the troops.
06Jos 8:10 Joshua started early the next morning and mobilized them. Then he and the elders of Israel led the troops up to Ai.
06Jos 8:11 All those who were with him went up and approached the city, arriving opposite Ai, and camped to the north of it, with a valley between them and the city.
06Jos 8:12 Now Joshua had taken about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
06Jos 8:13 The military force was stationed in this way: the main camp to the north of the city and its rear guard to the west of the city. And that night Joshua went into the valley.
06Jos 8:14 When the king of Ai saw [the Israelites], the men of the city hurried and went out early in the morning, so that he and all his people could engage Israel in battle at a suitable place facing the plain [of the Jordan]. But he did not know there was an ambush [waiting] for him behind the city.
06Jos 8:15 Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten back by them and fled toward the wilderness.
06Jos 8:16 Then all the troops of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
06Jos 8:17 Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city exposed while they pursued Israel.
06Jos 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out the sword in your hand toward Ai, for I will hand the city over to you." So Joshua held out his sword toward it.
06Jos 8:19 When he held out his hand, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They ran, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
06Jos 8:20 The men of Ai turned and looked back, and smoke from the city was rising to the sky! They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers.
06Jos 8:21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the [men in] ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
06Jos 8:22 The men in the ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were [trapped] between the Israelite forces, some on one side and some on the other. They struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained,
06Jos 8:23 but they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
06Jos 8:24 When Israel had finished killing everyone living in Ai who had pursued them into the open country, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword.
06Jos 8:25 The total of those who fell that day, both men and women, was 12,000-- all the people of Ai.
06Jos 8:26 Joshua did not draw back his hand that was holding the sword until all the inhabitants of Ai were completely destroyed.
06Jos 8:27 Israel plundered only the cattle and spoil of that city for themselves, according to the LORD's command that He had given Joshua.
06Jos 8:28 Joshua burned Ai and left it a permanent ruin, desolate to this day.
06Jos 8:29 He hung [the body of] the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take his body down from the tree. They threw it down at the entrance of the city gate and put a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.
06Jos 8:30 At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel,
06Jos 8:31 just as Moses the LORD's servant had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used. Then they offered burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings on it.
06Jos 8:32 There on the stones, Joshua copied the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of the Israelites.
06Jos 8:33 All Israel, foreigner and citizen alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on either side of the ark of the LORD's covenant facing the Levitical priests who carried it. As Moses the LORD's servant had commanded earlier, half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, to bless the people of Israel.
06Jos 8:34 Afterwards, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law-- the blessings as well as the curses-- according to all that is written in the book of the law.
06Jos 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read before the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, little children, and foreigners who were with them.
06Jos 9:1 When all the kings heard [about Jericho and Ai], those who were west of the Jordan in the hill country, in the Judean foothills, and all along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea toward Lebanon-- the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites--
06Jos 9:2 they formed a unified alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.
06Jos 9:3 When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
06Jos 9:4 they acted deceptively. They gathered provisions and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
06Jos 9:5 [They wore] old, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies. Their entire provision of bread was dry and crumbly.
06Jos 9:6 They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant land. Please make a treaty with us."
06Jos 9:7 The men of Israel replied to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us. How can we make a treaty with you?"
06Jos 9:8 They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Then Joshua asked them, "Who are you and where do you come from?"
06Jos 9:9 They replied to him, "Your servants have come from a far away land because of the reputation of the LORD your God. For we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt,
06Jos 9:10 and all that He did to the two Amorite kings beyond the Jordan-- Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.
06Jos 9:11 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, 'Take provisions with you for the journey; go and meet them and say, "We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us."'
06Jos 9:12 This bread of ours was warm when we took it from our houses as food on the day we left to come to you. But take a look, it is now dry and crumbly.
06Jos 9:13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals of ours are worn out from the extremely long journey."
06Jos 9:14 Then the men [of Israel] took some of their provisions, but did not seek the LORD's counsel.
06Jos 9:15 So Joshua established peace with them and made a treaty to let them live, and the leaders of the community swore an oath to them.
06Jos 9:16 Three days after making the treaty with them, they heard that the Gibeonites were their neighbors, living among them.
06Jos 9:17 So the Israelites set out and reached the Gibeonite cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
06Jos 9:18 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then the whole community grumbled against the leaders.
06Jos 9:19 All the leaders answered them, "We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
06Jos 9:20 This is how we will treat them: we will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them."
06Jos 9:21 They also said, "Let them live." So the Gibeonites became woodcutters and water carriers for the whole community, as the leaders had promised them.
06Jos 9:22 Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said to them, "Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us?
06Jos 9:23 Therefore you are cursed and will always be slaves-- woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."
06Jos 9:24 The Gibeonites answered him, "It was clearly reported to your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you. We greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.
06Jos 9:25 Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever you think is right."
06Jos 9:26 This is what Joshua did to them: he delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill them.
06Jos 9:27 On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers-- as they are today-- for the community and for the LORD's altar at the place He would choose.
06Jos 10:1 Now Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and completely destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were [living] among them.
06Jos 10:2 So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed because Gibeon was a large city like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
06Jos 10:3 Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent [word] to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,
06Jos 10:4 "Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."
06Jos 10:5 So the five Amorite kings-- the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon-- joined forces, advanced with all their armies, besieged Gibeon, and fought against it.
06Jos 10:6 Then the men of Gibeon sent [word] to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: "Don't abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, for all the Amorite kings living in the hill country have joined forces against us."
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua and his whole military force, including all the fighting men, came from Gilgal.
06Jos 10:8 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you."
06Jos 10:9 So Joshua caught them by surprise, after marching all night from Gilgal.
06Jos 10:10 The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel. He defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them through the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
06Jos 10:11 As they fled before Israel, the LORD threw large hailstones on them from the sky along the descent of Beth-horon all the way to Azekah, and they died. More of them died from the hail than the Israelites killed with the sword.
06Jos 10:12 On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel: "Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and moon, over the valley of Aijalon."
06Jos 10:13 And the sun stood still and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on its enemies. Isn't this written in the Book of Jashar? So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed its setting almost a full day.
06Jos 10:14 There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought for Israel.
06Jos 10:15 Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 10:16 Now the five [defeated] kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
06Jos 10:17 It was reported to Joshua: "The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah."
06Jos 10:18 Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and station men by it to guard the kings.
06Jos 10:19 But as for the rest of you, don't stay there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Don't let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has handed them over to you."
06Jos 10:20 So Joshua and the Israelites finished inflicting a terrible slaughter on them until they were destroyed, although a few survivors ran away to the fortified cities.
06Jos 10:21 The people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. No one could say a thing against the Israelites.
06Jos 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of there."
06Jos 10:23 That is what they did. They brought the five kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon to Joshua out of the cave.
06Jos 10:24 When they had brought the kings to him, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the military commanders who had accompanied him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks.
06Jos 10:25 Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous, for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight."
06Jos 10:26 After this, Joshua struck them down and executed them. He hung their bodies on five trees and they were there until evening.
06Jos 10:27 At sunset Joshua commanded that they be taken down from the treesand thrown into the cave where they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day.
06Jos 10:28 On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it down with the sword, including its king. He completely destroyed it and everyone in it, leaving no survivors. So he treated the king of Makkedah as he had the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:29 Joshua and all Israel with him crossed from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
06Jos 10:30 The LORD also handed it and its king over to Israel. He struck it down, putting everyone in it to the sword, and left no survivors in it. He treated Libnah's king as he had the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:31 From Libnah, Joshua and all Israel with him crossed to Lachish. They laid siege to it and attacked it.
06Jos 10:32 The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua captured it on the second day. He struck it down, putting everyone in it to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.
06Jos 10:33 At that time Horam king of Gezer went to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him down along with his people, leaving no survivors in it.
06Jos 10:34 Then Joshua crossed from Lachish to Eglon and all Israel with him. They laid siege to it and attacked it.
06Jos 10:35 On that day they captured it and struck it down, putting everyone in it to the sword. He completely destroyed it that day, just as he had done to Lachish.
06Jos 10:36 Next, Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.
06Jos 10:37 They captured it and struck down its king, all its villages, and everyone in it with the sword. Just as he had done at Eglon, he left no survivors. He completely destroyed Hebron and everyone in it.
06Jos 10:38 Finally, Joshua turned toward Debir and attacked it. And all Israel was with him.
06Jos 10:39 He captured it-- its king and all its villages. They struck them down with the sword and completely destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors. He treated Debir and its king as he had treated Hebron and as he had treated Libnah and its king.
06Jos 10:40 So Joshua conquered the whole region-- the hill country, the Negev, the Judean foothills, and the slopes-- with all their kings, leaving no survivors. He completely destroyed every living being, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
06Jos 10:41 Joshua conquered everyone from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
06Jos 10:42 Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
06Jos 10:43 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 11:1 When Jabin king of Hazor heard [this news], he sent [a message] to: Jobab king of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph,
06Jos 11:2 and the kings of the north in the hill country, the plain south of Chinnereth, the Judean foothills, and the Slopes of Dor to the west,
06Jos 11:3 the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
06Jos 11:4 They went out with all their armies-- a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore-- along with a vast number of horses and chariots.
06Jos 11:5 All these kings joined forces; they came together and camped at the waters of Merom to attack Israel.
06Jos 11:6 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, for at this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over dead to Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots."
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and his whole military force surprised them at the waters of Merom and attacked them.
06Jos 11:8 The LORD handed them over to Israel, and they struck them down, pursuing them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and to the east as far as the valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors.
06Jos 11:9 Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots.
06Jos 11:10 At that time Joshua turned back, captured Hazor, and struck down its king with the sword, because Hazor had formerly been the leader of all these kingdoms.
06Jos 11:11 They struck down everyone in it with the sword, completely destroying them; he left no one alive. Then he burned down Hazor.
06Jos 11:12 Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and struck them down with the sword. He completely destroyed them, as Moses the LORD's servant had commanded.
06Jos 11:13 However, Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood on their mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
06Jos 11:14 The Israelites plundered all the spoils and cattle of these cities for themselves. But they struck down every person with the sword until they had annihilated them, leaving no one alive.
06Jos 11:15 Just as the LORD had commanded His servant Moses, Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:16 So Joshua took all this land-- the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the Judean foothills, the plain, and the hill country of Israel with its Judean foothills--
06Jos 11:17 from Mount Halak, which ascends to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.
06Jos 11:18 Joshua waged war with all these kings for a long time.
06Jos 11:19 No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites who inhabited Gibeon; all of them were taken in battle.
06Jos 11:20 For it was the LORD's intention to harden their hearts, so that they would engage Israel in battle, be completely destroyed without mercy, and be annihilated, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:21 At that time Joshua proceeded to exterminate the Anakim from the hill country-- Hebron, Debir, Anab-- all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them with their cities.
06Jos 11:22 No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites, except for some remaining in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
06Jos 11:23 So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that the LORD had told Moses. Joshua then gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal allotments. After this, the land had rest from war.
06Jos 12:1 The Israelites struck down the following kings of the land and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan to the east and from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:
06Jos 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites lived in Heshbon. He ruled [over the territory] from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along the middle of the valley, and half of Gilead up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites),
06Jos 12:3 the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
06Jos 12:4 Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
06Jos 12:5 He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all Bashan up to the Geshurite and Maacathite border, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
06Jos 12:6 Moses the LORD's servant and the Israelites struck them down. And Moses the LORD's servant gave their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 12:7 Joshua and the Israelites struck down the following kings of the land beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which ascends toward Seir (Joshua gave their land as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their allotments:
06Jos 12:8 the hill country, the Judean foothills, the plain, the slopes, the desert, and the Negev of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):
06Jos 12:9 the king of Jericho one the king of Ai, which is next to Bethel one
06Jos 12:10 the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one
06Jos 12:11 the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one
06Jos 12:12 the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one
06Jos 12:13 the king of Debir one the king of Geder one
06Jos 12:14 the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
06Jos 12:15 the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
06Jos 12:16 the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
06Jos 12:17 the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
06Jos 12:18 the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one
06Jos 12:19 the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
06Jos 12:20 the king of Shimron-meron one the king of Achshaph one
06Jos 12:21 the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one
06Jos 12:22 the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
06Jos 12:23 the king of Dor in Naphoth-dor one the king of Goiim in Gilgal one
06Jos 12:24 the king of Tirzah one [the total number of] all kings: 31
06Jos 13:1 Joshua was now old, advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, "You have become old, advanced in years, but a great deal of the land remains to be possessed.
06Jos 13:2 This is the land that remains: All the districts of the Philistines and the Geshurites:
06Jos 13:3 from the Shihor east of Egypt to the border of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite territory)-- the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as the Avvites
06Jos 13:4 in the south; all the land of the Canaanites: from Arah of the Sidonians to Aphek and as far as the border of the Amorites;
06Jos 13:5 the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon east from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath--
06Jos 13:6 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians. I will drive them out before the Israelites, only distribute the land as an inheritance for Israel, as I have commanded you.
06Jos 13:7 Therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh."
06Jos 13:8 With the other half of the tribe, the Reubenites and Gadites had received the inheritance Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the LORD's servant had given them:
06Jos 13:9 From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, all the Medeba plateau as far as Dibon,
06Jos 13:10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the Ammonites;
06Jos 13:11 also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah--
06Jos 13:12 the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei; he was one of the remaining Rephaim. Moses struck them down and drove them out,
06Jos 13:13 but the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites and Maacathites. So Geshur and Maacath live in Israel to this day.
06Jos 13:14 He did not give any inheritance to the tribe of Levi. This was its inheritance, just as He had promised: the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 13:15 To the tribe of the Reubenites by their clans, Moses gave
06Jos 13:16 this as their territory: From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, to the whole plateau as far as Medeba,
06Jos 13:17 with Heshbon and all its cities on the plateau-- Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,
06Jos 13:18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
06Jos 13:19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley,
06Jos 13:20 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth--
06Jos 13:21 all the cities of the plateau, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. Moses had killed him and the chiefs of Midian-- Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba-- the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
06Jos 13:22 Along with those the Israelites put to death, they also killed the diviner, Balaam son of Beor, with the sword.
06Jos 13:23 The border of the Reubenites was the Jordan and its plain. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites by their clans, with the cities and their villages.
06Jos 13:24 To the tribe of the Gadites by their clans, Moses gave
06Jos 13:25 this as their territory: Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites to Aroer, near Rabbah;
06Jos 13:26 from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
06Jos 13:27 in the valley: Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon-- the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon. [Their land also included] the Jordan and its territory as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east side of the Jordan.
06Jos 13:28 This was the inheritance of the Gadites by their clans, with the cities and their villages.
06Jos 13:29 And to half the tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the tribe of Manasseh's descendants by their clans, Moses gave
06Jos 13:30 this as their territory: From Mahanaim through all Bashan-- all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, including all of Jair's Villagesthat are in Bashan-- 60 cities.
06Jos 13:31 But half of Gilead, and Og's royal cities in Bashan-- Ashtaroth and Edrei-- are for the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh, that is, half the descendants of Machir by their clans.
06Jos 13:32 These were the portions Moses gave [them] on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
06Jos 13:33 But Moses did not give a portion to the tribe of Levi. The LORD, the God of Israel, was their inheritance, just as He had promised them.
06Jos 14:1 The Israelites received these portions that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes gave them in the land of Canaan.
06Jos 14:2 Their inheritance was by lot as the LORD commanded through Moses for the nine and a half tribes,
06Jos 14:3 because Moses had given the inheritance to the two and a half tribes beyond the Jordan. But he gave no inheritance among them to the Levites.
06Jos 14:4 The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. No portion of the land was given to the Levites except cities to live in, along with pasturelands for their cattle and livestock.
06Jos 14:5 So the Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
06Jos 14:6 The descendants of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD promised Moses the man of God at Kadesh-barnea about you and me.
06Jos 14:7 I was 40 years old when Moses the LORD's servant sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout the land, and I brought back an honest report.
06Jos 14:8 My brothers who went with me caused the people's hearts to melt with fear, but I remained loyal to the LORD my God.
06Jos 14:9 On that day Moses promised me, 'The land where you have set foot will be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever, because you have remained loyal to the LORD my God.'
06Jos 14:10 "As you see, the LORD has kept me alive [these] 45 years as He promised, since the LORD spoke this word to Moses while Israel was journeying in the wilderness. Here I am today, 85 years old.
06Jos 14:11 I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. My strength for battle and for daily tasks is now as it was then.
06Jos 14:12 Now give me this hill country the LORD promised [me] on that day, because you heard then that the Anakim are there, as well as large fortified cities. Perhaps the LORD will be with me and I will drive them out as the LORD promised."
06Jos 14:13 Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as an inheritance.
06Jos 14:14 Therefore, Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day, because he remained loyal to the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 14:15 Hebron's name used to be Kiriath-arba; Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. After this, the land had rest from war.
06Jos 15:1 Now the allotment for the tribe of the descendants of Judah by their clans was in the southernmost region, south of the wilderness of Zin to the border of Edom.
06Jos 15:2 Their southern border began at the tip of the Dead Sea on the south bay
06Jos 15:3 and went south of the ascent of Akrabbim, proceeded to Zin, ascended to the south of Kadesh-barnea, passed Hezron, ascended to Addar, and turned to Karka.
06Jos 15:4 It proceeded to Azmon and to the Brook of Egypt and so the border ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This is your southern border.
06Jos 15:5 Now the eastern border was along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan. The border on the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
06Jos 15:6 It ascended to Beth-hoglah, proceeded north of Beth-arabah, and ascended to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
06Jos 15:7 Then the border ascended to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning north to the Gilgal that is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is south of the ravine. The border proceeded to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel.
06Jos 15:8 From there the border ascended the Valley of Hinnom to the southern Jebusite slope (that is, Jerusalem) and ascended to the top of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
06Jos 15:9 From the top of the hill the border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, went to the cities of Mount Ephron, and then curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
06Jos 15:10 The border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, went to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), descended to Beth-shemesh, and proceeded to Timnah.
06Jos 15:11 Then the border reached to the slope north of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron, proceeded to Mount Baalah, went to Jabneel, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 15:12 Now the western border was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah around their clans.
06Jos 15:13 He gave Caleb son of Jephunneh [the following] portion among the descendants of Judah based on the LORD's instruction to Joshua: Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron; Arba was the father of Anak).
06Jos 15:14 Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, descendants of Anak.
06Jos 15:15 From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir whose name used to be Kiriath-sepher,
06Jos 15:16 and Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife to the one who strikes down and captures Kiriath-sepher."
06Jos 15:17 So Othniel son of Caleb's brother, Kenaz, captured it, and Caleb gave his daughter Achsah to him as a wife.
06Jos 15:18 When she arrived, she persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
06Jos 15:19 She replied, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me the springs of water also." So he gave her the upper and lower springs.
06Jos 15:20 This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Judah by their clans.
06Jos 15:21 These were the outermost cities of the tribe of the descendants of Judah toward the border of Edom in the Negev: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
06Jos 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
06Jos 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
06Jos 15:24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
06Jos 15:25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
06Jos 15:26 Amam, Shema, Moladah,
06Jos 15:27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
06Jos 15:28 Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, Biziothiah,
06Jos 15:29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
06Jos 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
06Jos 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
06Jos 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon-- 29 cities in all, with their villages.
06Jos 15:33 In the Judean foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
06Jos 15:34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
06Jos 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
06Jos 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim-- 14 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:37 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
06Jos 15:38 Dilan, Mizpeh, Jokthe-el,
06Jos 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
06Jos 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish,
06Jos 15:41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah-- 16 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:42 Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
06Jos 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
06Jos 15:44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah-- nine cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:45 Ekron, with its towns and villages;
06Jos 15:46 from Ekron to the sea, all [the cities] near Ashdod, with their villages;
06Jos 15:47 Ashdod, with its towns and villages; Gaza, with its towns and villages, to the Brook of Egypt and the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 15:48 In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh-- 11 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06Jos 15:53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior-- nine cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah-- 10 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:58 Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon-- six cities, with their villages;
06Jos 15:60 Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah-- two cities, with their villages.
06Jos 15:61 In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi-- six cities, with their villages.
06Jos 15:63 But the descendants of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. So the Jebusites live in Jerusalem among the descendants of Judah to this day.
06Jos 16:1 The allotment for the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness ascending from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.
06Jos 16:2 From Bethel it went to Luz and proceeded to the border of the Archites by Ataroth.
06Jos 16:3 It then descended westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 16:4 So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance.
06Jos 16:5 This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth-addar on the east of Upper Beth-horon.
06Jos 16:6 In the north the border went westward from Michmethath; it turned eastward from Taanath-shiloh and passed it east of Janoah.
06Jos 16:7 From Janoah it descended to Ataroth and Naarah, and then reached Jericho and went to the Jordan.
06Jos 16:8 From Tappuah the border went westward along the Brook of Kanah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans, together with
06Jos 16:9 the cities set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of the descendants of Manasseh-- all these cities with their villages.
06Jos 16:10 But, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites live in Ephraim to this day, but they are forced laborers.
06Jos 17:1 This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph's firstborn. Gilead and Bashan came to Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh and the father of Gilead, who was a man of war.
06Jos 17:2 So the allotment was for the rest of Manasseh's descendants by their clans, for the sons of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, by their clans.
06Jos 17:3 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
06Jos 17:4 They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our male relatives." So they gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers, in keeping with the LORD's instruction.
06Jos 17:5 As a result, 10 tracts fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan,
06Jos 17:6 because Manasseh's daughters received an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of Manasseh's sons.
06Jos 17:7 The border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem. It then went southward toward the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
06Jos 17:8 The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah [itself] on Manasseh's border belonged to the descendants of Ephraim.
06Jos 17:9 From there the border descended to the Brook of Kanah; south of the brook, cities belonged to Ephraim among Manasseh's cities. Manasseh's border was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 17:10 Ephraim's [territory] was to the south and Manasseh's to the north, with the Sea as its border. They reached Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
06Jos 17:11 Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean with its towns, Ibleam with its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor with its towns; the inhabitants of En-dor with its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach with its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo with its towns-- the three [cities] of Naphath.
06Jos 17:12 The descendants of Manasseh could not possess these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land.
06Jos 17:13 However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they imposed forced labor on the Canaanites but did not drive them out completely.
06Jos 17:14 Joseph's descendants said to Joshua: "Why did you give us only one tribal allotment as an inheritance? We have many people, because the LORD has greatly blessed us."
06Jos 17:15 "If you have so many people," Joshua replied to them, "go to the forest and clear [an area] for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, because Ephraim's hill country is too small for you."
06Jos 17:16 But the descendants of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who inhabit the valley area have iron chariots, both at Beth-shean with its towns and in the Jezreel Valley."
06Jos 17:17 So Joshua replied to Joseph's family (that is, Ephraim and Manasseh), "You have many people and great strength. You will not have just one lot,
06Jos 17:18 because the hill country will be yours also. It is a forest; clear it and its outlying areas will be yours. You can also drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and are strong."
06Jos 18:1 The entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh where it set up the tent of meeting there; the land had been subdued by them.
06Jos 18:2 Seven tribes among the Israelites were left who had not divided up their inheritance.
06Jos 18:3 So Joshua said to the Israelites, "How long will you delay going out to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, gave you?
06Jos 18:4 Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe, and I will send them out. They are to go and survey the land, write a description of it for the purpose of their inheritance, and return to me.
06Jos 18:5 Then they are to divide it into seven portions. Judah is to remain in its territory in the south, and Joseph's family in their territory in the north.
06Jos 18:6 When you have written a description of the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God.
06Jos 18:7 But the Levites among you do not get a portion, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD. Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have taken their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses the LORD's servant gave them."
06Jos 18:8 As the men prepared to go, Joshua commanded them to write down a description of the land, saying, "Go and survey the land, write a description of it, and return to me. I will then cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD."
06Jos 18:9 So the men left, went through the land, and described it by towns in a document of seven sections. They returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
06Jos 18:10 Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.
06Jos 18:11 The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin's descendants by their clans, and their allotted territory lay between Judah's descendants and Joseph's descendants.
06Jos 18:12 Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, ascended to the slope of Jericho on the north, through the hill country westward, and ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
06Jos 18:13 From there the border went toward Luz, to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel); it then went down by Ataroth-addar, over the hill south of Lower Beth-horon.
06Jos 18:14 On the west side, from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south, the border curved, turning southward, and ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the descendants of Judah. This was the west side [of their border].
06Jos 18:15 The south side began at the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border extended westward; it went to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah.
06Jos 18:16 The border descended to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. It ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the south Jebusite slope and downward to En-rogel.
06Jos 18:17 It curved northward and went to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan, Reuben's son.
06Jos 18:18 Then it went north to the slope opposite the Jordan Valleyand proceeded into the valley.
06Jos 18:19 The border continued to the north slope of Beth-hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
06Jos 18:20 The Jordan formed the border on the east side. This was the inheritance of Benjamin's descendants, by their clans, according to its surrounding borders.
06Jos 18:21 These were the cities of the tribe of Benjamin's descendants by their clans: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
06Jos 18:22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
06Jos 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
06Jos 18:24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba-- 12 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 18:25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
06Jos 18:26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
06Jos 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
06Jos 18:28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-- 14 cities, with their villages. This was the inheritance for Benjamin's descendants by their clans.
06Jos 19:1 The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of his descendants by their clans, but their inheritance was within the portion of Judah's descendants.
06Jos 19:2 Their inheritance included: Beer-sheba (or Sheba), Moladah,
06Jos 19:3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
06Jos 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
06Jos 19:5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
06Jos 19:6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen-- 13 cities, with their villages;
06Jos 19:7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan-- four cities, with their villages;
06Jos 19:8 and all the villages surrounding these cities as far as Baalath-beer (Ramah of the south). This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon's descendants by their clans.
06Jos 19:9 The inheritance of Simeon's descendants was within the territory of Judah's descendants, because the share for Judah's descendants was too large for them. So Simeon's descendants received an inheritance within Judah's portion.
06Jos 19:10 The third lot came up for Zebulun's descendants by their clans. The territory of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid;
06Jos 19:11 their border went up westward to Maralah, reached Dabbesheth, and met the brook east of Jokneam.
06Jos 19:12 From Sarid, it turned east toward the sunrise along the border of Chisloth-tabor, went to Daberath, and went up to Japhia.
06Jos 19:13 From there, it went east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin; it extended to Rimmon, curving around to Neah.
06Jos 19:14 The border then circled around Neah on the north to Hannathon and ended at the valley of Iphtah-el,
06Jos 19:15 along with Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem-- 12 cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:16 This was the inheritance of Zebulun's descendants by their clans, these cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:17 The fourth lot came out for the tribe of Issachar's descendants by their clans.
06Jos 19:18 Their territory went to Jezreel, and [included] Chesulloth, Shunem,
06Jos 19:19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
06Jos 19:20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
06Jos 19:21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, Beth-pazzez.
06Jos 19:22 The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan-- 16 cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:23 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar's descendants by their clans, the cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:24 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher's descendants by their clans.
06Jos 19:25 Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
06Jos 19:26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal and reached westward to Carmel and Shihor-libnath.
06Jos 19:27 It turned eastward to Beth-dagon, passed Zebulun and the valley of Iphtah-el, north toward Beth-emek and Neiel, and went north to Cabul,
06Jos 19:28 Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.
06Jos 19:29 The boundary then turned to Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre; it turned back to Hosah and ended at the sea, including Mahalab, Achzib,
06Jos 19:30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob-- 22 cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:31 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher's descendants by their clans, these cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:32 The sixth lot came out for Naphtali's descendants by their clans.
06Jos 19:33 Their boundary went from Heleph and from the oak in Zaanannim, including Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan.
06Jos 19:34 To the west, the boundary turned to Aznoth-tabor and went from there to Hukkok, reaching Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan on the east.
06Jos 19:35 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
06Jos 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
06Jos 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,
06Jos 19:38 Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh-- 19 cities, with their villages.
06Jos 19:39 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali's descendants by their clans, the cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:40 The seventh lot came out for the Danite tribe by its clans.
06Jos 19:41 The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,
06Jos 19:42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
06Jos 19:43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
06Jos 19:44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
06Jos 19:45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
06Jos 19:46 Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the territory facing Joppa.
06Jos 19:47 When the territory of the Danites slipped out of their control, they went up and fought against Leshem, captured it, and struck it down with the sword. So they took possession of it, lived there, and renamed Leshem after their ancestor Dan.
06Jos 19:48 This was the inheritance of the Danite tribe by its clans, these cities with their villages.
06Jos 19:49 When they had finished distributing the land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them.
06Jos 19:50 By the LORD's command, they gave him the city Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, which he requested. He rebuilt the city and lived in it.
06Jos 19:51 These were the portions that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families distributed to the Israelite tribes by lot at Shiloh in the LORD's presence at the entrance to the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing up the land.
06Jos 20:1 Then the LORD spoke to Joshua,
06Jos 20:2 "Tell the Israelites: 'Select your cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,
06Jos 20:3 so that a person who kills someone unintentionally or accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
06Jos 20:4 When someone flees to one of these cities, stands at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before the elders of that city, they are to bring him into the city and give him a place to live among them.
06Jos 20:5 And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not hand the one who committed manslaughter over to him, for he killed his neighbor accidentally and did not hate him beforehand.
06Jos 20:6 He is to stay in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest serving at that time. Then the one who committed manslaughter may return home to his own city from which he fled.'"
06Jos 20:7 So they designated Kedesh in the hill country of Naphtali in Galilee, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06Jos 20:8 Across the Jordan east of Jericho, they selected Bezer on the wilderness plateau from Reuben's tribe, Ramoth in Gilead from Gad's tribe, and Golan in Bashan from Manasseh's tribe.
06Jos 20:9 These are the cities appointed for all the Israelites and foreigners among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there and not die at the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the assembly.
06Jos 21:1 The heads of the Levite families approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes.
06Jos 21:2 They told them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan: "The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities to live in, with their pasturelands for our livestock."
06Jos 21:3 So the Israelites, by the LORD's command, gave the Levites these cities with their pasturelands from their inheritance.
06Jos 21:4 The lot came out for the Kohathite clans: The Levites who were the descendants of Aaron the priest received 13 cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
06Jos 21:5 The remaining descendants of Kohath received 10 cities by lot from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 21:6 Gershon's descendants received 13 cities by lot from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and half the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06Jos 21:7 Merari's descendants received 12 cities for their clans from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
06Jos 21:8 The Israelites gave these cities with their pasturelands around them to the Levites by lot, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06Jos 21:9 The Israelites gave these cities by name from the tribes of the descendants of Judah and Simeon
06Jos 21:10 to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because they received the first lot.
06Jos 21:11 They gave them Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) with its surrounding pasturelands in the hill country of Judah. Arba was the father of Anak.
06Jos 21:12 But they gave the fields and villages of the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06Jos 21:13 They gave to the descendants of Aaron the priest: Hebron, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Libnah with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:14 Jattir with its pasturelands, Eshtemoa with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:15 Holon with its pasturelands, Debir with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:16 Ain with its pasturelands, Juttah with its pasturelands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasturelands-- nine cities from these two tribes.
06Jos 21:17 From the tribe of Benjamin [they gave]: Gibeon with its pasturelands, Geba with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth with its pasturelands, and Almon with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:19 All 13 cities with their pasturelands were for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
06Jos 21:20 The allotted cities to the remaining clans of Kohath's descendants, who were Levites, came from the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 21:21 The Israelites gave them: Shechem, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim with its pasturelands, and Beth-horon with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:23 From the tribe of Dan [they gave]: Elteke with its pasturelands, Gibbethon with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon with its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:25 From half the tribe of Manasseh [they gave]: Taanach with its pasturelands and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands-- two cities.
06Jos 21:26 All 10 cities with their pasturelands were for the clans of Kohath's other descendants.
06Jos 21:27 From half the tribe of Manasseh, [they gave] to the descendants of Gershon, who were one of the Levite clans: Golan, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands in Bashan, and Beeshterah with its pasturelands-- two cities.
06Jos 21:28 From the tribe of Issachar [they gave]: Kishion with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth with its pasturelands, and En-gannim with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:30 From the tribe of Asher [they gave]: Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:31 Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:32 From the tribe of Naphtali [they gave]: Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands-- three cities.
06Jos 21:33 All 13 cities with their pasturelands were for the Gershonites by their clans.
06Jos 21:34 From the tribe of Zebulun, [they gave] to the clans of the descendants of Merari, who were the remaining Levites: Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah with its pasturelands, and Nahalal with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:36 From the tribe of Reuben, [they gave]: Bezer with its pasturelands, Jahzah with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands-- four cities.
06Jos 21:38 From the tribe of Gad, [they gave]: Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Mahanaim with its pasturelands,
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon with its pasturelands, and Jazer with its pasturelands-- four cities in all.
06Jos 21:40 All 12 cities were allotted to the clans of Merari's descendants, the remaining Levite clans.
06Jos 21:41 Within the Israelite possession there were 48 cities in all with their pasturelands for the Levites.
06Jos 21:42 Each of these cities had its own surrounding pasturelands; this was true for all the cities.
06Jos 21:43 So the LORD gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their fathers, and they took possession of it and settled there.
06Jos 21:44 The LORD gave them rest on every side according to all He had sworn to their fathers. None of their enemies were able to stand against them, for the LORD handed over all their enemies to them.
06Jos 21:45 None of the good promises the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed. Everything was fulfilled.
06Jos 22:1 Joshua summoned the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,
06Jos 22:2 and told them, "You have done everything Moses the LORD's servant commanded you and have obeyed me in everything I commanded you.
06Jos 22:3 You have not deserted your brothers even once this whole time but have carried out the requirement of the command of the LORD your God.
06Jos 22:4 Now that He has given your brothers rest, just as He promised them, return to your homes in your own land that Moses the LORD's servant gave you across the Jordan.
06Jos 22:5 Only carefully obey the command and instruction that Moses the LORD's servant gave you: to love the LORD your God, walk in all His ways, keep His commands, remain faithful to Him, and serve Him with all your heart and all your soul."
06Jos 22:6 Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way, and they went to their homes.
06Jos 22:7 Moses had given [territory] to half the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, but Joshua had given [territory] to the other half, with their brothers, on the west side of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them to their homes and blessed them,
06Jos 22:8 he said, "Return to your homes with great wealth: a huge number of cattle, and silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a large quantity of clothing. Share the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
06Jos 22:9 The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to go to their own land of Gilead, which they took possession of according to the LORD's command through Moses.
06Jos 22:10 When they came to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh built a large, impressive altar there by the Jordan.
06Jos 22:11 Then the Israelites heard [it] said, "Look, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of Canaan at the region of the Jordan, on the Israelite side."
06Jos 22:12 When the Israelites heard [this], the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to go to war against them.
06Jos 22:13 The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead.
06Jos 22:14 [They sent] 10 leaders with him-- one family leader for each tribe of Israel. All of them were heads of their families among the clans of Israel.
06Jos 22:15 They went to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and told them,
06Jos 22:16 "This is what the LORD's entire community says: 'What is this treachery you have committed today against the God of Israel by turning away from the LORD and building an altar for yourselves, so that you are in rebellion against the LORD today?
06Jos 22:17 Wasn't the sin of Peor, which brought a plague on the LORD's community, enough for us, so that we have not cleansed ourselves from it even to this day,
06Jos 22:18 and now, you would turn away from the LORD? If you rebel against the LORD today, tomorrow He will be angry with the entire community of Israel.
06Jos 22:19 But if the land you possess is defiled, cross over to the land the LORD possesses where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take possession [of it] among us. But don't rebel against the LORD or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
06Jos 22:20 Wasn't Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction, bringing wrath on the entire community of Israel? He was not the only one who perished because of his sin.'"
06Jos 22:21 The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the Israelite clans,
06Jos 22:22 "The LORD is the God of gods! The LORD is the God of gods! He knows, and may Israel also know. Do not spare us today, if [it was] in rebellion or treachery against the LORD
06Jos 22:23 that we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from Him. May the LORD Himself hold us accountable if [we intended] to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it.
06Jos 22:24 We actually did this from a specific concern that in the future your descendants might say to our descendants, 'What relationship do you have with the LORD, the God of Israel?
06Jos 22:25 For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you descendants of Reuben and Gad. You have no share in the LORD!' So your descendants may cause our descendants to stop fearing the LORD.
06Jos 22:26 "Therefore we said: Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offering or sacrifice.
06Jos 22:27 Instead, it is to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, so that we may carry out the worship of the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings. Then in the future, your descendants will not be able to say to our descendants, 'You have no share in the LORD!'
06Jos 22:28 We thought that if they said this to us or to our generations in the future, we would reply: Look at the replica of the LORD's altar that our fathers made, not for burnt offering or sacrifice, but as a witness between us and you.
06Jos 22:29 We would never rebel against the LORD or turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offering, grain offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God, which is in front of His tabernacle."
06Jos 22:30 When Phinehas the priest and the community leaders, the heads of Israel's clans who were with him, heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.
06Jos 22:31 Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Him. As a result, you have delivered the Israelites from the LORD's power."
06Jos 22:32 Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead to the Israelites in the land of Canaan and brought back a report to them.
06Jos 22:33 The Israelites were pleased with the report, and they praised God. They spoke no more about going to war against them to ravage the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
06Jos 22:34 So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar: It is a witness between us that the LORD is God.
06Jos 23:1 A long time after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, Joshua was old, getting on in years.
06Jos 23:2 So Joshua summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers, and said to them, "I am old, getting on in years,
06Jos 23:3 and you have seen for yourselves everything the LORD your God did to all these nations on your account, because it was the LORD your God who was fighting for you.
06Jos 23:4 See, I have allotted these remaining nations to you as an inheritance for your tribes, including all the nations I have destroyed, from the Jordan westward to the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 23:5 The LORD your God will force them back on your account and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you.
06Jos 23:6 "Be very strong, and continue obeying all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you do not turn from it to the right or left
06Jos 23:7 and so that you do not associate with these nations remaining among you. Do not call on the names of their gods or make an oath to them; do not worship them or bow down to them.
06Jos 23:8 Instead, remain faithful to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
06Jos 23:9 "The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and no one has been able to stand against you to this day.
06Jos 23:10 One of you routed a thousand, because the LORD your God was fighting for you, as He promised.
06Jos 23:11 So be very diligent to love the LORD your God for your own well-being.
06Jos 23:12 For if you turn away and cling to the rest of these nations remaining among you, and if you intermarry or associate with them and they with you,
06Jos 23:13 know for certain that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out before you. They will become a snare and a trap for you, a scourge for your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you disappear from this good land the LORD your God has given you.
06Jos 23:14 "I am now going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and all your soul that none of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.
06Jos 23:15 Since every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come about, so He will bring on you every bad thing until He has annihilated you from this good land the LORD your God has given you.
06Jos 23:16 If you break the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and worship other gods, and bow down to them, the LORD's anger will burn against you, and you will quickly disappear from this good land He has given you."
06Jos 24:1 Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem and summoned Israel's elders, leaders, judges, and officers, and they presented themselves before God.
06Jos 24:2 Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Long ago your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods.
06Jos 24:3 But I took your father Abraham from the region beyond the Euphrates River, led him throughout the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac,
06Jos 24:4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau as a possession, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
06Jos 24:5 " 'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, I plagued Egypt by what I did there, and afterwards I brought you out.
06Jos 24:6 When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen as far as the sea.
06Jos 24:7 Your fathers cried out to the LORD, so He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea over them, engulfing them. Your own eyes saw what I did to Egypt. After that, you lived in the wilderness a long time.
06Jos 24:8 " 'Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I handed them over to you. You possessed their land, and I annihilated them before you.
06Jos 24:9 Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you,
06Jos 24:10 but I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, he repeatedly blessed you, and I delivered you from his hand.
06Jos 24:11 " 'You then crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho-- as well as the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites-- fought against you, but I handed them over to you.
06Jos 24:12 I sent the hornetahead of you, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you. It was not by your sword or bow.
06Jos 24:13 I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build, though you live in them; you are eating from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.'
06Jos 24:14 "Therefore, fear the LORD and worship Him in sincerity and truth. Get rid of the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and worship the LORD.
06Jos 24:15 But if it doesn't please you to worship the LORD, choose for yourselves today the one you will worship: the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my family, we will worship the LORD."
06Jos 24:16 The people replied, "We will certainly not abandon the LORD to worship other gods!
06Jos 24:17 For the LORD our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, the place of slavery and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us all along the way we went and among all the peoples whose lands we traveled through.
06Jos 24:18 The LORD drove out before us all the peoples, including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will worship the LORD, because He is our God."
06Jos 24:19 But Joshua told the people, "You will not be able to worship the LORD, because He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not remove your transgressions and sins.
06Jos 24:20 If you abandon the LORD and worship foreign gods, He will turn against [you], harm you, and completely destroy you, after He has been good to you."
06Jos 24:21 "No!" the people answered Joshua. "We will worship the LORD."
06Jos 24:22 Joshua then told the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship the LORD." "We are witnesses," they said.
06Jos 24:23 "Then get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and offer your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06Jos 24:24 So the people said to Joshua, "We will worship the LORD our God and obey Him."
06Jos 24:25 On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people at Shechem and established a statute and ordinance for them.
06Jos 24:26 Joshua recorded these things in the book of the law of God; he also took a large stone and set it up there under the oak next to the sanctuary of the LORD.
06Jos 24:27 And Joshua said to all the people, "You see this stone-- it will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words the LORD said to us, and it will be a witness against you, so that you will not deny your God."
06Jos 24:28 Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
06Jos 24:29 After these things, the LORD's servant, Joshua son of Nun, died at the age of 110.
06Jos 24:30 They buried him in his allotted territory at Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
06Jos 24:31 Israel worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua's lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua, and who had experienced all the works the LORD had done for Israel.
06Jos 24:32 Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the parcel of land Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for 100 qesitahs.It was an inheritance for Joseph's descendants.
06Jos 24:33 And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
07
07Jdg 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, "Who will be the first to fight for us against the Canaanites?"
07Jdg 1:2 The LORD answered, "Judah is to go. I have handed the land over to him."
07Jdg 1:3 Judah said to his brother Simeon, "Come with me to my territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. I will also go with you to your territory." So Simeon went with him.
07Jdg 1:4 When Judah attacked, the LORD handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They struck down 10,000 men in Bezek.
07Jdg 1:5 They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, fought against him, and struck down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
07Jdg 1:6 When Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07Jdg 1:7 Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up [scraps] under my table. God has repaid me for what I have done." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07Jdg 1:8 The men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
07Jdg 1:9 Afterwards, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites who were living in the hill country, the Negev, and the Judean foothills.
07Jdg 1:10 Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (Hebron was formerly named Kiriath-arba). They struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
07Jdg 1:11 From there they marched against the residents of Debir (Debir was formerly named Kiriath-sepher).
07Jdg 1:12 Caleb said, "Whoever strikes down and captures Kiriath-sepher, I will give my daughter Achsah to him as a wife."
07Jdg 1:13 So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's youngest brother, captured it, and Caleb gave his daughter Achsah to him as his wife.
07Jdg 1:14 When she arrived, she persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
07Jdg 1:15 She answered him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water also." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
07Jdg 1:16 The descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had gone up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah, which was in the Negev of Arad. They went to live among the people.
07Jdg 1:17 Judah went with his brother Simeon, struck the Canaanites who were living in Zephath, and completely destroyed the town. So they named the town Hormah.
07Jdg 1:18 Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory.
07Jdg 1:19 The LORD was with Judah and enabled them to take possession of the hill country, but they could not drive out the people who were living in the valley because those people had iron chariots.
07Jdg 1:20 Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised. Then Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak who lived there.
07Jdg 1:21 At the same time the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites have lived among the Benjaminites in Jerusalem to this day.
07Jdg 1:22 The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
07Jdg 1:23 They sent spies to Bethel (the town was formerly named Luz).
07Jdg 1:24 The spies saw a man coming out of the town and said to him, "Please show us how to get into town, and we will treat you well."
07Jdg 1:25 When he showed them the way into the town, they put the town to the sword but released the man and his entire family.
07Jdg 1:26 Then the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a town, and named it Luz. That is its name to this day.
07Jdg 1:27 At that time Manasseh failed to take possession of Beth-sheanand its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the residents of Dor and its villages, or the residents of Ibleamand its villages, or the residents of Megiddo and its villages. But the Canaanites refused to leave this land.
07Jdg 1:28 When Israel became stronger, they made the Canaanites serve as forced labor but never drove them out completely.
07Jdg 1:29 At that time Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived among them in Gezer.
07Jdg 1:30 Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron or the residents of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them and served as forced labor.
07Jdg 1:31 Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco or of Sidon, or Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
07Jdg 1:32 The Asherites lived among the Canaanites who were living in the land, because they failed to drive them out.
07Jdg 1:33 Naphtali did not drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh or the residents of Beth-anath. They lived among the Canaanites who were living in the land, but the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served as their forced labor.
07Jdg 1:34 The Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country and did not allow them to go down into the valley.
07Jdg 1:35 The Amorites refused to leave Har-heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. When the house of Joseph got the upper hand, the Amorites were made to serve as forced labor.
07Jdg 1:36 The territory of the Amorites extended from the ascent of Akrabbim, that is from Sela upward.
07Jdg 2:1 The Angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, "I brought you out of Egypt and led you into the land I had promised to your fathers. I also said: I will never break My covenant with you.
07Jdg 2:2 You are not to make a covenant with the people who are living in this land, and you are to tear down their altars.But you have not obeyed Me. What is this you have done?
07Jdg 2:3 Therefore, I now say: I will not drive out these people before you. They will be thornsin your sides, and their gods will be a trap to you."
07Jdg 2:4 When the Angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.
07Jdg 2:5 So they named that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
07Jdg 2:6 Joshua sent the people away, and the Israelites went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
07Jdg 2:7 The people worshiped the LORD throughout Joshua's lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua. They had seen all the LORD's great works He had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110.
07Jdg 2:9 They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
07Jdg 2:10 That whole generation was also gathered to their ancestors. After them another generation rose up who did not know the LORD or the works He had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:11 The Israelites did what was evil in the LORD's sight. They worshiped the Baals
07Jdg 2:12 and abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They went after other gods from the surrounding peoples and bowed down to them. They infuriated the LORD,
07Jdg 2:13 for they abandoned Him and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.
07Jdg 2:14 The LORD's anger burned against Israel, and He handed them over to marauders who raided them. He sold them to the enemies around them, so that they could no longer resist their enemies.
07Jdg 2:15 Whenever the Israelites went out, the LORD was against them and brought disaster [on them], just as He had promised and sworn to them. So they suffered greatly.
07Jdg 2:16 The LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the power of their marauders,
07Jdg 2:17 but they did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods, bowing down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD's commands. They did not do as their fathers did.
07Jdg 2:18 Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites, the LORD was with him and saved the people from the power of their enemies while the judge was still alive. The LORD was moved to pity whenever they groaned because of those who were oppressing and afflicting them.
07Jdg 2:19 Whenever the judge died, the Israelites would act even more corruptly than their fathers, going after other gods to worship and bow down to them. They did not turn from their [evil] practices or their obstinate ways.
07Jdg 2:20 The Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He declared, "Because this nation has violated My covenant that I made with their fathers and disobeyed Me,
07Jdg 2:21 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
07Jdg 2:22 [I did this] to test Israel and to see whether they would keep the LORD's way by walking in it, as their fathers had."
07Jdg 2:23 The LORD left these nations and did not drive them out immediately. He did not hand them over to Joshua.
07Jdg 3:1 These are the nations the LORD left in order to test Israel, since none of these Israelites had fought in any of the wars with Canaan.
07Jdg 3:2 This was to teach the future generations of the Israelites [how to fight in] battle, especially those who had not fought before.
07Jdg 3:3 [These nations included:] the five rulers of the Philistines and all of the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanese mountains from Mount Baal-hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath.
07Jdg 3:4 The LORD left them to test Israel, to determine if they would keep the LORD's commands He had given their fathers through Moses.
07Jdg 3:5 But they settled among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
07Jdg 3:6 The Israelites took their daughters as wives for themselves, gave their own daughters to their sons, and worshiped their gods.
07Jdg 3:7 The Israelites did what was evil in the LORD's sight; they forgot the LORD their God and worshiped the Baals and the Asherahs.
07Jdg 3:8 The LORD's anger burned against Israel, and He sold them to Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram of the Two Rivers,and the Israelites served him eight years.
07Jdg 3:9 The Israelites cried out to the LORD. So the LORD raised up Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's youngest brother as a deliverer to save the Israelites.
07Jdg 3:10 The Spirit of the LORD was on him, and he judged Israel. Othniel went out to battle, and the LORD handed over Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram to him, so that Othniel overpowered him.
07Jdg 3:11 Then the land was peaceful 40 years, and Othniel son of Kenaz died.
07Jdg 3:12 The Israelites again did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel, because they had done what was evil in the LORD's sight.
07Jdg 3:13 After Eglon convinced the Ammonites and the Amalekites to join forces with him, he attacked and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms.
07Jdg 3:14 The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab 18 years.
07Jdg 3:15 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjaminite, as a deliverer for them. The Israelites sent him to Eglon king of Moab with tribute [money].
07Jdg 3:16 Ehud made himself a double-edged sword 18 inches long. He strapped it to his right thigh under his clothes
07Jdg 3:17 and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was an extremely fat man.
07Jdg 3:18 When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried it.
07Jdg 3:19 At the carved images near Gilgal he returned and said, "King [Eglon], I have a secret message for you." The king called for silence, and all his attendants left him.
07Jdg 3:20 Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in his room upstairs [where it was] cool. Ehud said, "I have a word from God for you," and the king stood up from his throne.
07Jdg 3:21 Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon's belly.
07Jdg 3:22 Even the handle went in after the blade, and Eglon's fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And Eglon's insides came out.
07Jdg 3:23 Ehud escaped by way of the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upstairs room behind him.
07Jdg 3:24 Ehud was gone when Eglon's servants came in. They looked and found the doors of the upstairs room locked and thought he was relieving himself in the cool room.
07Jdg 3:25 The servants waited until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upstairs room. So they took the key and opened the doors-- and there was their lord lying dead on the floor!
07Jdg 3:26 Ehud escaped while the servants waited. He crossed over [the Jordan] near the carved images and reached Seirah.
07Jdg 3:27 After he arrived, he sounded the ram's horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hill country, and he became their leader.
07Jdg 3:28 He told them, "Follow me, because the LORD has handed over your enemies, the Moabites, to you." So they followed him, captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.
07Jdg 3:29 At that time they struck down about 10,000 Moabites, all strong and able-bodied men. Not one of them escaped.
07Jdg 3:30 Moab became subject to Israel that day, and the land was peaceful 80 years.
07Jdg 3:31 After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath [became judge]. He delivered Israel by striking down 600 Philistines with an oxgoad.
07Jdg 4:1 The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud had died.
07Jdg 4:2 So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his forces was Sisera who lived in Harosheth of the Nations.
07Jdg 4:3 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, because Jabin had 900 iron chariots, and he harshly oppressed them 20 years.
07Jdg 4:4 Deborah, a woman who was a prophet and the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
07Jdg 4:5 It was her custom to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her for judgment.
07Jdg 4:6 She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "Hasn't the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded [you]: 'Go, deploy [the troops] on Mount Tabor, and take with you 10,000 men from the Naphtalites and Zebulunites?
07Jdg 4:7 Then I will lure Sisera commander of Jabin's forces, his chariots, and his army at the Wadi Kishon [to fight] against you, and I will hand him over to you.'"
07Jdg 4:8 Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go. But if you will not go with me, I will not go."
07Jdg 4:9 "I will go with you," she said, "but you will receive no honor on the road you are about to take, because the LORD will sell Sisera into a woman's hand." So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:10 Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; 10,000 men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.
07Jdg 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the sons of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law, and pitched his tent beside the oak tree of Zaanannim, which was near Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:12 It was reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor.
07Jdg 4:13 Sisera summoned all his 900 iron chariots and all the people who were with him from Harosheth of the Nations to the Wadi Kishon.
07Jdg 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, "Move on, for this is the day the LORD has handed Sisera over to you. Hasn't the LORD gone before you?" So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.
07Jdg 4:15 The LORD threw Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army into confusion with the sword before Barak. Sisera left his chariot and fled on foot.
07Jdg 4:16 Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth of the Nations, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a single man was left.
07Jdg 4:17 Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.
07Jdg 4:18 Jael went out to greet Sisera and said to him, "Come in, my lord. Come in with me. Don't be afraid." So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a rug.
07Jdg 4:19 He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty." She opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him [again].
07Jdg 4:20 Then he said to her, "Stand at the entrance to the tent. If a man comes and asks you, 'Is there a man here?' say, 'No.'"
07Jdg 4:21 While he was sleeping from exhaustion, Heber's wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went silently to Sisera. She hammered the peg into his temple and drove it into the ground, and he died.
07Jdg 4:22 When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to greet him and said to him, "Come and I will show you the man you are looking for." So he went in with her, and there was Sisera lying dead with a tent peg through his temple!
07Jdg 4:23 That day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
07Jdg 4:24 The power of the Israelites continued to increase against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.
07Jdg 5:1 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang:
07Jdg 5:2 When the leaders lead in Israel, when the people volunteer, praise the LORD.
07Jdg 5:3 Listen, kings! Pay attention, princes! I will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:4 LORD, when You came from Seir, when You marched from the fields of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens poured [rain], the clouds poured water.
07Jdg 5:5 The mountains melted before the LORD, even Sinai before the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the main ways were deserted, because travelers kept to the side roads.
07Jdg 5:7 Villages were deserted, they were deserted in Israel, until I, Deborah, I arose, a mother in Israel.
07Jdg 5:8 Israel chose new gods, then war was in the gates. Not a shield or spear was seen among 40,000 in Israel.
07Jdg 5:9 My heart is with the leaders of Israel, with the volunteers of the people. Praise the LORD!
07Jdg 5:10 You who ride on white donkeys, who sit on saddle blankets, and who travel on the road, give praise!
07Jdg 5:11 Let them tell the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous deeds of His warriors in Israel, with the voices of the singers at the watering places. Then the LORD's people went down to the gates.
07Jdg 5:12 "Awake! Awake, Deborah! Awake! Awake, sing a song! Arise Barak, and take hold of your captives, son of Abinoam!"
07Jdg 5:13 The survivors came down to the nobles; the LORD's people came down to me with the warriors.
07Jdg 5:14 Those with their roots in Amalek [came] from Ephraim; Benjamin [came with] your people after you. The leaders came down from Machir, and those who carry a marshal's staff [came] from Zebulun.
07Jdg 5:15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; Issachar was with Barak. They set out at his heels in the valley. There was great searching of heart among the clans of Reuben.
07Jdg 5:16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds listening to the playing of pipes for the flocks? There was great searching of heart among the clans of Reuben.
07Jdg 5:17 Gilead remained beyond the Jordan. Dan, why did you linger at the ships? Asher remained at the seashore and stayed in his harbors.
07Jdg 5:18 Zebulun was a people risking their lives, Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield.
07Jdg 5:19 Kings came and fought. Then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no spoil of silver.
07Jdg 5:20 The stars fought from the heavens; the stars fought with Sisera from their courses.
07Jdg 5:21 The river Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul, in strength!
07Jdg 5:22 The horses' hooves then hammered-- the galloping, galloping of his stallions.
07Jdg 5:23 "Curse Meroz," says the Angel of the LORD, "Bitterly curse her inhabitants, for they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty warriors."
07Jdg 5:24 Jael is most blessed of women, the wife of Heber the Kenite; she is most blessed among tent-dwelling women.
07Jdg 5:25 He asked for water; she gave him milk. She brought him curdled milk in a majestic bowl.
07Jdg 5:26 She reached for a tent peg, her right hand, for a workman's mallet. Then she hammered Sisera-- she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple.
07Jdg 5:27 He collapsed, he fell, he lay down at her feet; he collapsed, he fell at her feet; where he collapsed, there he fell-- dead.
07Jdg 5:28 Sisera's mother looked through the window; she [peered] through the lattice, crying out: "Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why don't I hear the hoofbeats of his horses?"
07Jdg 5:29 Her wisest princesses answer her; she even answers herself:
07Jdg 5:30 "Are they not finding and dividing the spoil-- a girl or two for each warrior, the spoil of colored garments for Sisera, the spoil of an embroidered garment or two for my neck?"
07Jdg 5:31 LORD, may all your enemies perish as Sisera did. But may those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its strength. And the land was peaceful 40 years.
07Jdg 6:1 The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD handed them over to Midian seven years,
07Jdg 6:2 and they oppressed Israel. Because of Midian, the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.
07Jdg 6:3 Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the eastern peoples came and attacked them.
07Jdg 6:4 They encamped against them and destroyed the produce of the land, even as far as Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to eat, as well as no sheep, ox or donkey.
07Jdg 6:5 For the Midianites came with their cattle and their tents like a great swarm of locusts. They and their camels were without number, and they entered the land to waste it.
07Jdg 6:6 So Israel became poverty stricken because of Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the LORD.
07Jdg 6:7 When the Israelites cried out to Him because of Midian,
07Jdg 6:8 the LORD sent a prophet to them. He said to them, "This is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I brought you out of Egypt and out of the place of slavery.
07Jdg 6:9 I delivered you from the power of Egypt and the power of all who oppressed you. I drove them out before you and gave you their land.
07Jdg 6:10 I said to you: I am the LORD your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites whose land you live in. But you did not obey Me.'"
07Jdg 6:11 The Angel of the LORD came, and He sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash, the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was threshing wheat in the wine vat in order to hide it from the Midianites.
07Jdg 6:12 Then the Angel of the LORD appeared to him and said: "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior."
07Jdg 6:13 Gideon said to Him, "Please Sir, if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened? And where are all His wonders that our fathers told us about? They said, 'Hasn't the LORD brought us out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian."
07Jdg 6:14 The LORD turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Am I not sending you?"
07Jdg 6:15 He said to Him, "Please, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house."
07Jdg 6:16 "But I will be with you," the LORD said to him. "You will strike Midian down [as if it were] one man."
07Jdg 6:17 Then he said to Him, "If I have found favor in Your sight, give me a sign that You are speaking with me.
07Jdg 6:18 Please do not leave this place until I return to You. Let me bring my gift and set it before You." And He said, "I will stay until you return."
07Jdg 6:19 So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. He brought them out and offered them to Him under the oak.
07Jdg 6:20 The Angel of God said to him, "Take the meat with the unleavened bread, put it on this stone, and pour the broth [on it]." And he did so.
07Jdg 6:21 The Angel of the LORD extended the tip of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire came up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the Angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
07Jdg 6:22 When Gideon realized that He was the Angel of the LORD, he said, "Oh no, Lord God! I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face!"
07Jdg 6:23 But the LORD said to him, "Peace to you. Don't be afraid, for you will not die."
07Jdg 6:24 So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it Yahweh Shalom. It is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites until today.
07Jdg 6:25 On that very night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's young bull and a second bull seven years old. Then tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
07Jdg 6:26 Build a well-constructed altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock. Take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down."
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon took 10 of his male servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it in the daytime, he did it at night.
07Jdg 6:28 When the men of the city got up in the morning, they found Baal's altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it cut down, and the second bull offered up on the altar that had been built.
07Jdg 6:29 They said to each other, "Who did this?" After they made a thorough investigation, they said, "Gideon son of Joash did it."
07Jdg 6:30 Then the men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die, because he tore down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it."
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Would you plead Baal's case for him? Would you save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead his own case, because someone tore down his altar."
07Jdg 6:32 That day, Gideon's father called him Jerubbaal, saying, "Let Baal plead his case with him," because he tore down his altar.
07Jdg 6:33 All the Midianites, Amalekites, and Qedemites gathered together, crossed over [the Jordan], and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
07Jdg 6:34 The Spirit of the LORD enveloped Gideon, and he blew the ram's horn and the Abiezrites rallied behind him.
07Jdg 6:35 He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, who rallied behind him. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who [also] came to meet him.
07Jdg 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "If You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You said,
07Jdg 6:37 I will put a fleece of wool here on the threshing floor. If dew is only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, I will know that You will deliver Israel by my strength, as You said."
07Jdg 6:38 And that is what happened. When he got up early in the morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of it, filling a bowl with water.
07Jdg 6:39 Gideon then said to God, "Don't be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground."
07Jdg 6:40 That night God did [as Gideon requested]: only the fleece was dry, and dew was all over the ground.
07Jdg 7:1 Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and everyone who was with him, got up early and camped beside the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them, below the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
07Jdg 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many people for Me to hand the Midianites over to you, or else Israel might brag: 'I did it myself.'
07Jdg 7:3 Now announce in the presence of the people: 'Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.' " So 22,000 of the people turned back, but 10,000 remained.
07Jdg 7:4 Then the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. If I say to you, 'This one can go with you,' he can go. But if I say about anyone, 'This one cannot go with you,' he cannot go."
07Jdg 7:5 So he brought the people down to the water, and the LORD said to Gideon, "Separate everyone who laps water with his tongue like a dog. Do the same with everyone who kneels to drink."
07Jdg 7:6 The number of those who lapped with their hands to their mouths was 300 men, and all the rest of the people knelt to drink water.
07Jdg 7:7 The LORD said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and hand the Midianites over to you. But everyone else is to go home."
07Jdg 7:8 So Gideon sent all the Israelites to their tents, but kept the 300 who took the people's provisions and their trumpets. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
07Jdg 7:9 That night the LORD said to him, "Get up and go into the camp, for I have given it into your hand.
07Jdg 7:10 But if you are afraid to go to the camp, go with Purah your servant.
07Jdg 7:11 Listen to what they say, and then you will be strengthened to go to the camp." So he went with Purah his servant to the outpost of the troops who were in the camp.
07Jdg 7:12 Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the Qedemites had settled down in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore.
07Jdg 7:13 When Gideon arrived, there was a man telling his friend [about] a dream. He said, "Listen, I had a dream: a loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp, struck a tent, and it fell. The loaf turned the tent upside down so that it collapsed."
07Jdg 7:14 His friend answered: "This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has handed the entire Midianite camp over to him."
07Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to Israel's camp and said, "Get up, for the LORD has handed the Midianite camp over to you."
07Jdg 7:16 Then he divided the 300 men into three companies and gave each of the men a trumpet in one hand and an empty pitcher with a torch inside it [in the other].
07Jdg 7:17 "Watch me," he said, "and do the same. When I come to the outpost of the camp, do as I do.
07Jdg 7:18 When I and everyone with me blow our trumpets, you are also to blow your trumpets all around the camp. Then you will say, 'The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!'"
07Jdg 7:19 Gideon and the 100 men who were with him went to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch after the sentries had been stationed. They blew their trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
07Jdg 7:20 The three companies blew their trumpets and shattered their pitchers. They held their torches in their left hands, their trumpets in their right hands, and shouted, "The sword of the LORD and of Gideon!"
07Jdg 7:21 Each Israelite took his position around the camp, and the entire [Midianite] army fled, and cried out as they ran.
07Jdg 7:22 When Gideon's men blew their 300 trumpets, the LORD set the swords of each man in the army against each other. They fled to Beth-shittah in the direction of Zererah as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
07Jdg 7:23 Then the men of Israel were called from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, and they pursued the Midianites.
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim with this message: "Come down to intercept the Midianites and take control of the watercourses ahead of them as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they took control of the watercourses as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
07Jdg 7:25 They captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb, while they were pursuing the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.
07Jdg 8:1 The men of Ephraim said to him, "Why have you done this to us, not calling us when you went to fight against the Midianites?" And they argued with him violently.
07Jdg 8:2 So he said to them, "What have I done now compared to you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
07Jdg 8:3 God handed over to you Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian. What was I able to do compared to you?" When he said this, their anger against him subsided.
07Jdg 8:4 Gideon and the 300 men came to the Jordan and crossed it. They were exhausted, but still in pursuit.
07Jdg 8:5 He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give some loaves of bread to the people who are following me, because they are exhausted, for I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07Jdg 8:6 But the princes of Succoth asked, "Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hands that we should give bread to your army?"
07Jdg 8:7 Gideon replied, "Very well, when the LORD has handed Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will trample your flesh on thorns and briers from the wilderness!"
07Jdg 8:8 He went from there to Penuel and asked the same thing from them. The men of Penuel answered just as the men of Succoth had answered.
07Jdg 8:9 He also told the men of Penuel, "When I return in peace, I will tear down this tower!"
07Jdg 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and with them was their army of about 15,000 men, who were all those left of the entire army of the Qedemites. Those who had been killed were 120,000 warriors.
07Jdg 8:11 Gideon traveled on the caravan route, east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked their army while the army was unsuspecting.
07Jdg 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them. He captured these two kings of Midian and routed the entire army.
07Jdg 8:13 Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
07Jdg 8:14 He captured a youth from the men of Succoth and interrogated him. The youth wrote down for him the [names of the] 77 princes and elders of Succoth.
07Jdg 8:15 Then he went to the men of Succoth and said, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. You taunted me about them, saying, 'Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your power that we should give bread to your exhausted men?'"
07Jdg 8:16 So he took the elders of the city, as well as some thorns and briers from the wilderness, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them.
07Jdg 8:17 He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
07Jdg 8:18 He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" "They were like you," they said. "Each resembled the son of a king."
07Jdg 8:19 So he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother! As the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you."
07Jdg 8:20 Then he said to Jether, his firstborn, "Get up and kill them." The youth did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still a youth.
07Jdg 8:21 Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Get up and kill us yourself, for a man is judged by his strength." So Gideon got up, killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:22 Then the Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you as well as your sons and your grandsons, for you delivered us from the power of Midian."
07Jdg 8:23 But Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."
07Jdg 8:24 Then he said to them, "Let me make a request of you: Everyone give me an earring from his plunder." Now the enemy had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.
07Jdg 8:25 They said, "We agree to give them." So they spread out a mantle, and everyone threw an earring from his plunder on it.
07Jdg 8:26 The weight of the gold earrings he requested was about 43 pounds of gold, in addition to the crescent ornaments and ear pendants, the purple garments on the kings of Midian, and the chains on the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:27 Gideon made an ephod from all this and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. Then all Israel prostituted themselves with it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
07Jdg 8:28 So Midian was subdued before the Israelites, and they were no longer a threat. The land was peaceful 40 years during the days of Gideon.
07Jdg 8:29 Jerubbaal [(that is, Gideon)] son of Joash went back to live at his house.
07Jdg 8:30 Gideon had 70 sons, his own offspring, since he had many wives.
07Jdg 8:31 His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
07Jdg 8:32 Then Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07Jdg 8:33 When Gideon died, the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals and made Baal-berith their god.
07Jdg 8:34 The Israelites did not remember the LORD their God who had delivered them from the power of the enemies around them.
07Jdg 8:35 They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal ([that is,] Gideon) for all the good he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 9:1 Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his mother's brothers at Shechem and spoke to them and to all his maternal grandfather's clan, saying,
07Jdg 9:2 "Please speak in the presence of all the lords of Shechem, 'Is it better for you that 70 men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you or that one man rule over you?' Remember that I am your own flesh and blood."
07Jdg 9:3 His mother's relatives spoke all these words about him in the presence of all the lords of Shechem, and they were favorable to Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
07Jdg 9:4 So they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith. Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men with this money, and they followed him.
07Jdg 9:5 He went to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his 70 brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, on top of a large stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he hid himself.
07Jdg 9:6 Then all the lords of Shechem and of Beth-millo gathered together and proceeded to make Abimelech king at the oak of the pillar in Shechem.
07Jdg 9:7 When they told Jotham, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and called to them: Listen to me, lords of Shechem, and may God listen to you:
07Jdg 9:8 The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, "Reign over us."
07Jdg 9:9 But the olive tree said to them, "Should I stop giving my oil that honors both God and man, and rule over the trees?"
07Jdg 9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, "Come and reign over us."
07Jdg 9:11 But the fig tree said to them, "Should I stop giving my sweetness and my good fruit, and rule over trees?"
07Jdg 9:12 Later, the trees said to the grapevine, "Come and reign over us."
07Jdg 9:13 But the grapevine said to them, "Should I stop giving my wine that cheers both God and man, and rule over trees?"
07Jdg 9:14 Finally, all the trees said to the bramble, "Come and reign over us."
07Jdg 9:15 The bramble said to the trees, "If you really are anointing me as king over you, come and find refuge in my shade. But if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon."
07Jdg 9:16 "Now if you have acted faithfully and honestly in making Abimelech king, if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family, and if you have rewarded him appropriately for what he did--
07Jdg 9:17 for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you from the hand of Midian,
07Jdg 9:18 and now you have attacked my father's house today, killed his 70 sons on top of a large stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave, king over the lords of Shechem 'because he is your brother'--
07Jdg 9:19 if then, you have acted faithfully and honestly with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech and may he also rejoice in you.
07Jdg 9:20 But if not, may fire come from Abimelech and consume the lords of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come from the lords of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech."
07Jdg 9:21 Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and lived there because of his brother Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:22 When Abimelech had ruled over Israel three years,
07Jdg 9:23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem. They treated Abimelech deceitfully,
07Jdg 9:24 so that the crime against the 70 sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood would be avenged on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the lords of Shechem, who had helped him kill his brothers.
07Jdg 9:25 The lords of Shechem rebelled against him by putting people on the tops of the mountains to ambush and rob everyone who passed by them on the road. So this was reported to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:26 Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the lords of Shechem trusted him.
07Jdg 9:27 So they went out to the countryside and harvested grapes from their vineyards. They trod the grapes and held a celebration. Then they went to the house of their god, and as they ate and drank, they cursed Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:28 Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him? Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal, and isn't Zebul his officer? You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve Abimelech?
07Jdg 9:29 If only these people were in my power, I would remove Abimelech." So he said to Abimelech, "Gather your army and come out."
07Jdg 9:30 When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was angry.
07Jdg 9:31 So he sent messengers secretly to Abimelech, saying, "Look, Gaal son of Ebed, with his brothers, have come to Shechem and are turning the city against you.
07Jdg 9:32 Now tonight, you and the people with you are to come wait in ambush in the countryside.
07Jdg 9:33 Then get up early and at sunrise, charge the city. When he and the people who are with him come out against you, do to him whatever you can."
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and all the people with him got up at night and waited in ambush for Shechem in four units.
07Jdg 9:35 Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and the people who were with him got up from their ambush.
07Jdg 9:36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops!" But Zebul said to him, "The shadows of the mountains look like men to you."
07Jdg 9:37 Then Gaal spoke again: "Look, people are coming down from the central part of the land, and one unit is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak."
07Jdg 9:38 Zebul replied, "Where is your mouthing off now? You said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Aren't these the people you despised? Now go and fight them!"
07Jdg 9:39 So Gaal went out leading the lords of Shechem and fought against Abimelech,
07Jdg 9:40 but Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled before him. Many wounded died as far as the entrance of the gate.
07Jdg 9:41 Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers from Shechem.
07Jdg 9:42 The next day when the people went into the countryside, this was reported to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:43 He took the people, divided them into three companies, and waited in ambush in the countryside. He looked, and the people were coming out of the city, so he arose against them and struck them down.
07Jdg 9:44 Then Abimelech and the units that were with him rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate. The other two units rushed against all who were in the countryside and struck them down.
07Jdg 9:45 So Abimelech fought against the city that entire day, captured it, and killed the people who were in it. Then he tore down the city and sowed it with salt.
07Jdg 9:46 When all the lords of the Tower of Shechem heard, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.
07Jdg 9:47 Then it was reported to Abimelech that all the lords of the Tower of Shechem had gathered together.
07Jdg 9:48 So Abimelech and all the people who were with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his ax in his hand and cut a branch from the trees. He picked up the branch, put it on his shoulder, and said to the people who were with him, "Hurry and do what you have seen me do."
07Jdg 9:49 Each person also cut his own branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire around the people, and all the people in the Tower of Shechem died-- about 1,000 men and women.
07Jdg 9:50 Abimelech went to Thebez, camped against it, and captured it.
07Jdg 9:51 There was a strong tower inside the city, and all the men, women, and lords of the city fled there. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof of the tower.
07Jdg 9:52 When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he approached its entrance to set it on fire.
07Jdg 9:53 But a woman threw the upper portion of a millstone on Abimelech's head and fractured his skull.
07Jdg 9:54 He quickly called his armor-bearer and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, or they'll say about me, 'A woman killed him.' " So his armor-bearer thrust him through, and he died.
07Jdg 9:55 When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
07Jdg 9:56 In this way, the evil that Abimelech had done against his father, by killing his 70 brothers, God turned back on him.
07Jdg 9:57 And God also returned all the evil of the men of Shechem on their heads. So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came on them.
07Jdg 10:1 After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo [became judge] and began to deliver Israel. He was from Issachar and lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 10:2 Tola judged Israel 23 years, and when he died, was buried in Shamir.
07Jdg 10:3 After him came Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel 22 years.
07Jdg 10:4 He had 30 sons who rode on 30 young donkeys. They had 30 towns in Gilead, which are called Jair's Villages to this day.
07Jdg 10:5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
07Jdg 10:6 Then the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They worshiped the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and the Philistines. They abandoned the LORD and did not worship Him.
07Jdg 10:7 So the LORD's anger burned against Israel, and He sold them to the Philistines and the Ammonites.
07Jdg 10:8 They shattered and crushed the Israelites that year, and for 18 years [they did the same to] all the Israelites who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites in Gilead.
07Jdg 10:9 The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim. Israel was greatly oppressed,
07Jdg 10:10 so they cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against You. We have abandoned our God and worshiped the Baals."
07Jdg 10:11 The LORD said to the Israelites, "When the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines,
07Jdg 10:12 Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to Me, did I not deliver you from their power?
07Jdg 10:13 But you have abandoned Me and worshiped other gods. Therefore, I will not deliver you again.
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them deliver you in the time of your oppression."
07Jdg 10:15 But the Israelites said, "We have sinned. Deal with us as You see fit; only deliver us today!"
07Jdg 10:16 So they got rid of the foreign gods among them and worshiped the LORD, but He became weary of Israel's misery.
07Jdg 10:17 The Ammonites were called together, and they camped in Gilead. So the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
07Jdg 10:18 The rulers of Gilead said to one another, "Which man will lead the fight against the Ammonites? He will be the leader of all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:1 Jephthah the Gileadite was a great warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father.
07Jdg 11:2 Gilead's wife bore him sons, and when they grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You will have no inheritance in our father's house, because you are the son of another woman."
07Jdg 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Then some lawless men joined Jephthah and traveled with him.
07Jdg 11:4 Some time later, the Ammonites fought against Israel.
07Jdg 11:5 When the Ammonites made war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
07Jdg 11:6 They said to him, "Come, be our commander, and let's fight against the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:7 Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, "Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why then have you come to me now when you're in trouble?"
07Jdg 11:8 They answered Jephthah, "Since that's true, we now turn to you. Come with us, fight the Ammonites, and you will become leader of all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:9 So Jephthah said to them, "If you are bringing me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, I will be your leader."
07Jdg 11:10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD is our witness if we don't do as you say."
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead. The people put him over themselves as leader and commander, and Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah.
07Jdg 11:12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, "What do you have against me that you have come to fight against me in my land?"
07Jdg 11:13 The king of the Ammonites said to Jephthah's messengers, "When Israel came from Egypt, they seized my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan. Now restore it peaceably."
07Jdg 11:14 Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
07Jdg 11:15 to tell him, "This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:16 But when they came from Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:17 Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let us travel through your land,' but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent [messengers] to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:18 "Then they traveled through the wilderness and around the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon but did not enter into the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
07Jdg 11:19 "Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon. Israel said to him, 'Please let us travel through your land to our country,'
07Jdg 11:20 but Sihon did not trust Israel. Instead, Sihon gathered all his people, camped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
07Jdg 11:21 Then the LORD God of Israel handed over Sihon and all his people to Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of the entire land of the Amorites who lived in that country.
07Jdg 11:22 They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
07Jdg 11:23 "The LORD God of Israel has now driven out the Amorites before His people Israel, but will you drive us out?
07Jdg 11:24 Isn't it true that you may possess whatever your god Chemosh drives out for you, and we may possess everything the LORD our God drives out before us?
07Jdg 11:25 Now are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them?
07Jdg 11:26 While Israel lived 300 years in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, why didn't you take them back at that time?
07Jdg 11:27 I have not sinned against you, but you have wronged me by fighting against me. Let the LORD [who is] the Judge decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites would not listen to Jephthah's message that he sent him.
07Jdg 11:29 The Spirit of the LORD came on Jephthah, who traveled through Gilead and Manasseh, and then through Mizpah of Gilead. He crossed over to the Ammonites from Mizpah of Gilead.
07Jdg 11:30 Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: "If You will hand over the Ammonites to me,
07Jdg 11:31 whatever comes out of the doors of my house to greet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and I will offer it as a burnt offering."
07Jdg 11:32 Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD handed them over to him.
07Jdg 11:33 He defeated 20 of their cities with a great slaughter from Aroer all the way to the entrance of Minnith and to Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
07Jdg 11:34 When Jephthah went to his home in Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with tambourines and dancing! She was his only child; he had no other son or daughter besides her.
07Jdg 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, "No! [Not] my daughter! You have devastated me! You have brought great misery on me. I have given my word to the LORD and cannot take [it] back.
07Jdg 11:36 Then she said to him, "My father, you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me as you have said, for the LORD brought vengeance on your enemies, the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:37 She also said to her father, "Let me do this one thing: Let me wander two months through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity."
07Jdg 11:38 "Go," he said. And he sent her away two months. So she left with her friends and mourned her virginity as she wandered through the mountains.
07Jdg 11:39 At the end of two months, she returned to her father, and he kept the vow he had made about her. And she had never been intimate with a man. Now it became a custom in Israel
07Jdg 11:40 [that] four days each year the young women of Israel would commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
07Jdg 12:1 The men of Ephraim were called together and crossed [the Jordan] to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, "Why have you crossed over to fight against the Ammonites but didn't call us to go with you? We will burn your house down with you [in it]!"
07Jdg 12:2 Then Jephthah said to them, "My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites. So I called for you, but you didn't deliver me from their power.
07Jdg 12:3 When I saw that you weren't going to deliver me, I took my life in my own hands and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the LORD handed them over to me. Why then have you come today to fight against me?"
07Jdg 12:4 Then Jephthah gathered all of the men of Gilead. They fought and defeated Ephraim, because Ephraim had said, "You Gileadites are Ephraimite fugitives in [the territories of] Ephraim and Manasseh."
07Jdg 12:5 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim. Whenever a fugitive from Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the Gileadites asked him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he answered, "No,"
07Jdg 12:6 they told him, "Please say Shibboleth." If he said, "Sibboleth," because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, 42,000 from Ephraim died.
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
07Jdg 12:8 Ibzan, who was from Bethlehem, judged Israel after Jephthah
07Jdg 12:9 and had 30 sons. He gave his 30 daughters in marriage [to men] outside the tribe and brought back 30 wives for his sons from outside [the tribe]. Ibzan judged Israel seven years,
07Jdg 12:10 and when he died, he was buried in Bethlehem.
07Jdg 12:11 Elon, who was from Zebulun, judged Israel after Ibzan. He judged Israel 10 years,
07Jdg 12:12 and when he died, he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07Jdg 12:13 After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, who was from Pirathon, judged Israel.
07Jdg 12:14 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons, who rode on 70 donkeys. Abdon judged Israel eight years,
07Jdg 12:15 and when he died, he was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07Jdg 13:1 The Israelites again did what was evil in the LORD's sight, so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines 40 years.
07Jdg 13:2 There was a certain man from Zorah, from the family of Dan, whose name was Manoah; his wife was barren and had no children.
07Jdg 13:3 The Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "It is true that you are barren and have no children, but you will conceive and give birth to a son.
07Jdg 13:4 Now please be careful not to drink wine or other alcoholic beverages, or to eat anything unclean;
07Jdg 13:5 for indeed, you will conceive and give birth to a son. You must never cut his hair, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth, and he will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines."
07Jdg 13:6 Then the woman went and told her husband, "A man of God came to me. He looked like the awe-inspiring Angel of God. I didn't ask Him where He came from, and He didn't tell me His name.
07Jdg 13:7 He said to me, 'You will conceive and give a birth to a son. Therefore, do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day of his death.'"
07Jdg 13:8 Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, "Please Lord, let the man of God you sent come again to us and teach us what we should do for the boy who will be born."
07Jdg 13:9 God listened to Manoah, and the Angel of God came again to the woman. She was sitting in the field, and her husband Manoah was not with her.
07Jdg 13:10 The woman ran quickly to her husband and told him, "The man who came to me today has just come back!"
07Jdg 13:11 So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, "Are You the man who spoke to my wife?" "I am," He said.
07Jdg 13:12 Then Manoah asked, "When Your words come true, what will the boy's responsibilities and mission be?"
07Jdg 13:13 The Angel of the LORD answered Manoah, "Your wife needs to do everything I told her.
07Jdg 13:14 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine or drink wine or other alcoholic beverages. And she must not eat anything unclean. Your wife must do everything I have commanded her."
07Jdg 13:15 "Please stay here," Manoah told Him, "and we will prepare a young goat for You."
07Jdg 13:16 The Angel of the LORD said to him, "If I stay, I won't eat your food. But if you want to prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD." For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the LORD.
07Jdg 13:17 Then Manoah said to Him, "What is Your name, so that we may honor You when Your words come true?"
07Jdg 13:18 "Why do you ask My name," the Angel of the LORD asked him, "since it is wonderful."
07Jdg 13:19 Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD, and He did a wonderful thing while Manoah and his wife were watching.
07Jdg 13:20 When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the Angel of the LORD went up in its flame. When Manoah and his wife saw [this], they fell facedown on the ground.
07Jdg 13:21 The Angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah realized that it was the Angel of the LORD.
07Jdg 13:22 "We're going to die," he said to his wife, "because we have seen God!"
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had intended to kill us, He wouldn't have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from us, and He would not have shown us all these things or spoken to us now like this."
07Jdg 13:24 So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.
07Jdg 13:25 Then the Spirit of the LORD began to direct him in the Camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 14:1 Samson went down to Timnah and saw a young Philistine woman there.
07Jdg 14:2 He went back and told his father and his mother: "I have seen a young Philistine woman in Timnah. Now get her for me as a wife."
07Jdg 14:3 But his father and mother said to him, "Can't you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines for a wife?" But Samson told his father, "Get her for me, because I want her."
07Jdg 14:4 Now his father and mother did not know this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. At that time, the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
07Jdg 14:5 Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him,
07Jdg 14:6 the Spirit of the LORD took control of him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
07Jdg 14:7 Then he went and spoke to the woman, because Samson wanted her.
07Jdg 14:8 After some time, when he returned to get her, he left [the road] to see the lion's carcass, and there was a swarm of bees with honey in the carcass.
07Jdg 14:9 He scooped [some honey] into his hands and ate [it] as he went along. When he returned to his father and mother, he gave [some] to them and they ate [it]. But he did not tell them that he had scooped the honey from the lion's carcass.
07Jdg 14:10 His father went [to visit] the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, as young men were accustomed to do.
07Jdg 14:11 When the Philistines saw him, they brought 30 men to accompany him.
07Jdg 14:12 "Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can explain it to me during the seven days of the feast and figure it out, I will give you 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes.
07Jdg 14:13 But if you can't explain it to me, you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 changes of clothes." "Tell us your riddle," they replied. "Let's hear it."
07Jdg 14:14 So he said to them: Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet. After three days, they were unable to explain the riddle.
07Jdg 14:15 On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Persuade your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?"
07Jdg 14:16 So Samson's wife came to him, weeping, and said, "You hate me and don't love me! You told my people the riddle, but haven't explained it to me." "Look," he said, "I haven't even explained it to my father or mother, so [why] should I explain it to you?"
07Jdg 14:17 She wept the whole seven days of the feast, and at last, on the seventh day, he explained it to her, because she had nagged him so much. Then she explained it to her people.
07Jdg 14:18 On the seventh day before sunset, the men of the city said to him: What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion? So he said to them: If you hadn't plowed with my young cow, you wouldn't know my riddle now!
07Jdg 14:19 The Spirit of the LORD took control of him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed 30 of their men. He stripped them and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. In a rage, Samson returned to his father's house,
07Jdg 14:20 and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied him.
07Jdg 15:1 Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson [took] a young goat [as a gift] and visited his wife. "I want to go to my wife in her room," he said. But her father would not let him enter.
07Jdg 15:2 "I was sure you hated her," her father said, "so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Why not take her instead?"
07Jdg 15:3 Samson said to them, "This time I won't be responsible when I harm the Philistines."
07Jdg 15:4 So he went out and caught 300 foxes. He took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails.
07Jdg 15:5 Then he ignited the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the piles of grain and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
07Jdg 15:6 Then the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" They were told, "[It was] Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because he has taken Samson's wife and given her to another man." So the Philistines went to her and her father and burned [them] to death.
07Jdg 15:7 Then Samson told them, "Because you did this, I swear that I won't rest until I have taken vengeance on you."
07Jdg 15:8 He tore them limb from limb with a great slaughter, and he went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam.
07Jdg 15:9 The Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and raided Lehi.
07Jdg 15:10 So the men of Judah said, "Why have you attacked us?" They replied, "We have come to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he did to us."
07Jdg 15:11 Then 3,000 men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?" "I have done to them what they did to me," he answered.
07Jdg 15:12 They said to him, "We've come to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines." Then Samson told them, "Swear to me that you yourselves won't kill me."
07Jdg 15:13 "No," they said, "we won't kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them." So they tied him up with two new ropes and led him away from the rock.
07Jdg 15:14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD took control of him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like burnt flax and his bonds fell off his wrists.
07Jdg 15:15 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand, took it, and killed 1,000 men with it.
07Jdg 15:16 Then Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey I have piled them in a heap. With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed 1,000 men.
07Jdg 15:17 When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone and named that place Ramath-lehi.
07Jdg 15:18 He became very thirsty and called out to the LORD: "You have accomplished this great victory through Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
07Jdg 15:19 So God split a hollow place [in the ground] at Lehi, and water came out of it. After Samson drank, his strength returned, and he revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
07Jdg 15:20 And he judged Israel 20 years in the days of the Philistines.
07Jdg 16:1 Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went to bed with her.
07Jdg 16:2 When the Gazites [heard] that Samson was there, they surrounded the place and waited in ambush for him all that night at the city gate. While they were waiting quietly, they said, "Let us wait until dawn; then we will kill him."
07Jdg 16:3 But Samson stayed in bed until midnight when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate along with the two gateposts, and pulled them out, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking Hebron.
07Jdg 16:4 Some time later, he fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek Valley.
07Jdg 16:5 The Philistine leaders went to her and said, "Persuade him to tell you where his great strength comes from, so we can overpower him, tie him up, and make him helpless. Each of us will then give you 1,100 pieces of silver."
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me, where does your great strength [come from]? How could [someone] tie you up and make you helpless?"
07Jdg 16:7 Samson told her, "If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:8 The Philistine leaders brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them.
07Jdg 16:9 While the men in ambush were waiting in her room, she called out to him, "Samson, the Philistines are here!" But he snapped the bowstrings as a strand of yarn snaps when it touches fire. [The secret of] his strength remained unknown.
07Jdg 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have mocked me and told me lies! Won't you please tell me how you can be tied up?"
07Jdg 16:11 He told her, "If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used, I will become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:12 Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them, and shouted, "Samson, the Philistines are here!" But while the men in ambush were waiting in her room, he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
07Jdg 16:13 Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have mocked me all along and told me lies! Tell me how you can be tied up." He told her, "If you weave the seven braids on my head with the web of a loom--"
07Jdg 16:14 She fastened the braids with a pin and called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are here!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin, with the loom and the web.
07Jdg 16:15 "How can you say, 'I love you,' " she told him, "when your heart is not with me? This is the third time you have mocked me and not told me what makes your strength so great!"
07Jdg 16:16 Because she nagged him day after day and pled with him until she wore him out,
07Jdg 16:17 he told her the whole truth and said to her, "My hair has never been cut, because I am a Nazirite to God from birth. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become weak and be like any other man."
07Jdg 16:18 When Delilah realized that he had told her the whole truth, she sent this message to the Philistine leaders: "Come one more time, for he has told me the whole truth." The Philistine leaders came to her and brought the money with them.
07Jdg 16:19 Then she let him fall asleep on her lap and called a man to shave off the seven braids on his head. In this way, she rendered him helpless, and his strength left him.
07Jdg 16:20 Then she cried, "Samson, the Philistines are here!" When he awoke from his sleep, he said, "I will escape as I did before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
07Jdg 16:21 The Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles, and he was forced to grind grain in the prison.
07Jdg 16:22 But his hair began to grow back after it had been shaved.
07Jdg 16:23 Now the Philistine leaders gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced and said: Our god has handed over our enemy Samson to us.
07Jdg 16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god and said: Our god has handed over to us our enemy who destroyed our land and who multiplied our dead.
07Jdg 16:25 When they were drunk, they said, "Bring Samson here to entertain us." So they brought Samson from prison, and he entertained them. They had him stand between the pillars.
07Jdg 16:26 Samson said to the young man who was leading him by the hand, "Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple, so I can lean against them."
07Jdg 16:27 The temple was full of men and women; all the leaders of the Philistines were there, and about 3,000 men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain [them].
07Jdg 16:28 He called out to the LORD: "Lord God, please remember me. Strengthen me, God, just once more. With one act of vengeance, let me pay back the Philistines for my two eyes."
07Jdg 16:29 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars supporting the temple and leaned against them, one on his right hand and the other on his left.
07Jdg 16:30 Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." He pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the leaders and all the people in it. And the dead he killed at his death were more than those he had killed in his life.
07Jdg 16:31 Then his brothers and his father's family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. So he judged Israel 20 years.
07Jdg 17:1 There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Micah.
07Jdg 17:2 He said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver taken from you, and that I heard you utter a curse about-- here, I have the silver with me. I took it. So now I return it to you." Then his mother said, "My son, you are blessed by the LORD!"
07Jdg 17:3 He returned the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, "I personally consecrate the silver to the LORD for my son's benefit to make a carved image overlaid with silver."
07Jdg 17:4 So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took five pounds of silver and gave it to a silversmith. He made it into a carved image overlaid with silver, and it was in Micah's house.
07Jdg 17:5 This man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household idols, and installed one of his sons to be his priest.
07Jdg 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever he wanted.
07Jdg 17:7 There was a young man, a Levite, from Bethlehem in Judah, who resided within the clan of Judah.
07Jdg 17:8 The man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to settle wherever he could find a place. On his way he came to Micah's home in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 17:9 "Where do you come from?" Micah asked him. He answered him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I'm going to settle wherever I can find a place.
07Jdg 17:10 Micah replied, "Stay with me and be my father and priest, and I will give you four ounces of silver a year, along with your clothing and provisions." So the Levite went in
07Jdg 17:11 and agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons.
07Jdg 17:12 Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in Micah's house.
07Jdg 17:13 Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest."
07Jdg 18:1 In those days, there was no king in Israel, and the Danite tribe was looking for territory to occupy. Up to that time no territory had been captured [by them] among the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 18:2 So the Danites sent out five brave men from all their clans, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. They told them, "Go and explore the land." They came to the hill country of Ephraim as far as the home of Micah and spent the night there.
07Jdg 18:3 While they were near Micah's home, they recognized the speech of the young Levite. So they went over to him and asked, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is keeping you here?"
07Jdg 18:4 He told them what Micah had for him and that he had hired him as his priest.
07Jdg 18:5 Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God so we will know if we will have a successful journey."
07Jdg 18:6 The priest told them, "Go in peace. The LORD is watching over the journey you are going on."
07Jdg 18:7 The five men left and came to Laish. They saw that the people who were there were living securely, in the same way as the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking in the land and no oppressive ruler. They were far from the Sidonians, having no alliance with anyone.
07Jdg 18:8 When the men went back to their clans at Zorah and Eshtaol, their people asked them, "What did you find out?"
07Jdg 18:9 They answered, "Come on, let's go up against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why wait? Don't hesitate to go and invade and take possession of the land!
07Jdg 18:10 When you get there, you will come to an unsuspecting people and a wide-open land, for God has handed it over to you. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking."
07Jdg 18:11 Six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol armed with weapons of war.
07Jdg 18:12 They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. This is why the place is called the Camp of Dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
07Jdg 18:13 From there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim and arrived at Micah's house.
07Jdg 18:14 The five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish told their brothers, "Did you know that there are an ephod, household gods, and a carved image overlaid with silver in these houses? Now think about what you should do."
07Jdg 18:15 So they detoured there and went to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him.
07Jdg 18:16 The 600 Danite men were standing by the entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war.
07Jdg 18:17 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went in and took the carved image overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the household idols, while the priest was standing by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.
07Jdg 18:18 When they entered Micah's house and took the carved image overlaid with silver, the ephod, and the household idols, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
07Jdg 18:19 They told him, "Be quiet. Keep your mouth shut. Come with us and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person or for you to be a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?"
07Jdg 18:20 So the priest was pleased and took his ephod, household idols, and carved image, and went with the people.
07Jdg 18:21 They prepared to leave, putting their small children, livestock, and possessions in front of them.
07Jdg 18:22 After they were some distance from Micah's house, the men who were in the houses near it mobilized and caught up with the Danites.
07Jdg 18:23 They called to the Danites, who turned to face them, and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you mobilized [the men]?"
07Jdg 18:24 He said, "You took the gods I had made and the priest, and went away. What do I have left? How can you say to me, 'What's the matter with you?'"
07Jdg 18:25 The Danites said to him, "Don't raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives."
07Jdg 18:26 The Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were stronger than he was.
07Jdg 18:27 After they had taken the gods Micah had made and the priest that belonged to him, they went to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people. They killed them with their swords and burned down the city.
07Jdg 18:28 There was no one to save them, because it was far from Sidon and they had no alliance with anyone. It was in a valley that belonged to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it.
07Jdg 18:29 They named the city Dan, after the name of their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel. The city was formerly named Laish.
07Jdg 18:30 The Danites set up the carved image for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the Danite tribe until the time of the exile from the land.
07Jdg 18:31 So they set up for themselves Micah's carved image that he had made, [and it was there] as long as the house of God was in Shiloh.
07Jdg 19:1 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite living in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim acquired a woman from Bethlehem in Judah as his concubine.
07Jdg 19:2 But she was unfaithful to him and left him for her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah. She was there for a period of four months.
07Jdg 19:3 Then her husband got up and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back. His servant and a couple of donkeys were with him. So she brought him to her father's house, and when the girl's father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.
07Jdg 19:4 His father-in-law, the girl's father, detained him, and he stayed with him for three days. They ate, drank, and spent the nights there.
07Jdg 19:5 On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning and prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Have something to eat to keep up your strength and then you can go."
07Jdg 19:6 So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the girl's father said to the man, "Please agree to stay overnight and enjoy yourself."
07Jdg 19:7 The man got up to go, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed and spent the night there again.
07Jdg 19:8 He got up early in the morning of the fifth day to leave, but the girl's father said to him, "Please keep up your strength." So they waited until late afternoon and the two of them ate.
07Jdg 19:9 The man got up to go with his concubine and his servant, when his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Look, night is coming. Please spend the night. See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, enjoy yourself, then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey and go home."
07Jdg 19:10 But the man was unwilling to spend the night. He got up, departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). The man had his two saddled donkeys and his concubine with him.
07Jdg 19:11 When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Please, why not let us stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night here?"
07Jdg 19:12 But his master replied to him, "We will not stop at a foreign city where there are no Israelites. Let's move on to Gibeah."
07Jdg 19:13 "Come on," he said, "let's try to reach one of these places and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."
07Jdg 19:14 So they continued on their journey, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
07Jdg 19:15 They stopped to go in and spend the night in Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city square, but no one took them into their home to spend the night.
07Jdg 19:16 In the evening, an old man came in from his work in the field. He was from the hill country of Ephraim but was residing in Gibeah, and the men of that place were Benjaminites.
07Jdg 19:17 When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, "Where are you going, and where do you come from?"
07Jdg 19:18 He answered him, "We're traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I'm going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his home,
07Jdg 19:19 although we have both straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, your female servant, and the young man with your servant. There is nothing we lack."
07Jdg 19:20 "Peace to you," said the old man. "I'll take care of everything you need. Only don't spend the night in the square."
07Jdg 19:21 So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. Then they washed their feet and ate and drank.
07Jdg 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, all of a sudden, perverted men of the city surrounded the house and beat on the door. They said to the old man who was the owner of the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him!"
07Jdg 19:23 The owner of the house went out and said to them, "No, don't do [this] evil, my brothers. After all, this man has come into my house. Don't do this horrible thing.
07Jdg 19:24 Here, let me bring out my virgin daughter and the man's concubine now. Use them and do whatever you want to them. But don't do this horrible thing to this man."
07Jdg 19:25 But the men would not listen to him, so the man seized his concubine and took her outside to them. They raped her and abused her all night until morning. At daybreak they let her go.
07Jdg 19:26 Early that morning, the woman made her way back, and as it was getting light, she collapsed at the doorway of the man's house where her master was.
07Jdg 19:27 When her master got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went out to leave on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, collapsed near the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold.
07Jdg 19:28 "Get up," he told her. "Let's go." But there was no response. So the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
07Jdg 19:29 When he entered his house, he picked up a knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her into 12 pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel.
07Jdg 19:30 Everyone who saw it said, "Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen since the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt to this day. Think it over, discuss it, and speak up!"
07Jdg 20:1 All the Israelites from Dan to Beer-sheba and from the land of Gilead came out, and the community assembled as one body before the LORD at Mizpah.
07Jdg 20:2 The leaders of all the people and of all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God's people: 400,000 armed foot-soldiers.
07Jdg 20:3 The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites asked, "Tell us, how did this outrage occur?"
07Jdg 20:4 The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: "I went to Gibeah in Benjamin with my concubine to spend the night.
07Jdg 20:5 Citizens of Gibeah ganged up on me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, but they raped my concubine, and she died.
07Jdg 20:6 Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout Israel's territory, because they committed a horrible shame in Israel.
07Jdg 20:7 Look, all of you are Israelites. Give your judgment and verdict here [and now]."
07Jdg 20:8 Then all the people stood united and said, "None of us will go to his tent or return to his house.
07Jdg 20:9 Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go against it by lot.
07Jdg 20:10 We will take 10 men out of every 100 from all the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of every 1,000, and 1,000 out of every 10,000 to get provisions for the people when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin to punish them for all the horror they did in Israel."
07Jdg 20:11 So all the men of Israel gathered united against the city.
07Jdg 20:12 Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this outrage that has occurred among you?
07Jdg 20:13 Hand over the perverted men in Gibeah so we can put them to death and eradicate evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites would not obey their fellow Israelites.
07Jdg 20:14 Instead, the Benjaminites gathered together from their cities to Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites.
07Jdg 20:15 On that day the Benjaminites rallied 26,000 armed men from their cities, besides 700 choice men rallied by the inhabitants of Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:16 There were 700 choice men who were left-handed among all these people; all could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
07Jdg 20:17 The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, rallied 400,000 armed men, every one an experienced warrior.
07Jdg 20:18 They set out, went to Bethel, and inquired of God. The Israelites asked, "Who is to go first to fight for us against the Benjaminites?" And the LORD answered, "Judah will be first."
07Jdg 20:19 In the morning, the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:20 The men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took their battle positions against Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:21 The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and slaughtered 22,000 men of Israel on the field that day.
07Jdg 20:22 But the Israelite army rallied and again took their battle positions in the same place where they positioned themselves on the first day.
07Jdg 20:23 They went up, wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of Him: "Should we again fight against our brothers the Benjaminites?" And the LORD answered: "Fight against them."
07Jdg 20:24 On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites.
07Jdg 20:25 That same day the Benjaminites came out from Gibeah to meet them and slaughtered an additional 18,000 Israelites on the field; all were armed men.
07Jdg 20:26 The whole Israelite army went to Bethel where they wept and sat before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD.
07Jdg 20:27 Then the Israelites inquired of the LORD. In those days, the ark of the covenant of God was there,
07Jdg 20:28 and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was serving before it. The Israelites asked: "Should we again fight against our brothers the Benjaminites or should we stop?" The LORD answered: "Fight, because I will hand them over to you tomorrow."
07Jdg 20:29 So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:30 On the third day the Israelites fought against the Benjaminites and took their battle positions against Gibeah as before.
07Jdg 20:31 Then the Benjaminites came out against the people and were drawn away from the city. They began to attack the people as before, killing about 30 men of Israel on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah through the open country.
07Jdg 20:32 The Benjaminites said, "We are defeating them as before." But the Israelites said, "Let's flee and draw them away from the city to the highways."
07Jdg 20:33 So all the men of Israel got up from their places and took their battle positions at Baal-tamar, while the Israelites in ambush charged out of their places west of Geba.
07Jdg 20:34 Then 10,000 choice men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was about to strike them.
07Jdg 20:35 The LORD defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 men of Benjamin; all were armed men.
07Jdg 20:36 Then the Benjaminites realized they had been defeated. The men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin, because they were confident in the ambush they had set against Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:37 The men in ambush had rushed quickly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword.
07Jdg 20:38 The men of Israel had a prearranged signal with the men in ambush: when they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city,
07Jdg 20:39 the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin had begun to strike them down, killing about 30 men of Israel, they said, "They're defeated before us, just as they were in the first battle."
07Jdg 20:40 But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, Benjamin looked behind them, and the whole city was going up in smoke.
07Jdg 20:41 Then the men of Israel returned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had struck them.
07Jdg 20:42 They retreated before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities slaughtered those between them.
07Jdg 20:43 They surrounded the Benjaminites, pursued them, and easily overtook them near Gibeah toward the east.
07Jdg 20:44 There were 18,000 men who died from Benjamin; all were warriors.
07Jdg 20:45 Then Benjamin turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel killed 5,000 men on the highways. They overtook them at Gidom and struck 2,000 more dead.
07Jdg 20:46 All the Benjaminites who died that day were 25,000 armed men; all were warriors.
07Jdg 20:47 But 600 men escaped into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and stayed there four months.
07Jdg 20:48 The men of Israel turned back against the [other] Benjaminites and killed them with their swords-- the entire city, the animals, and everything that remained. They also burned down all the cities that remained.
07Jdg 21:1 The men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah: "None of us will give his daughter to a Benjaminite in marriage."
07Jdg 21:2 So the people went to Bethel and sat there before God until evening. They wept loudly and bitterly,
07Jdg 21:3 and cried out, "Why, LORD God of Israel, has it occurred that one tribe is [missing] in Israel today?"
07Jdg 21:4 The next day the people got up early, built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
07Jdg 21:5 The Israelites asked, "Who of all the tribes of Israel didn't come to the LORD with the assembly?" For a great oath had been taken that anyone who had not come to the LORD at Mizpah would certainly be put to death.
07Jdg 21:6 But the Israelites had compassion on their brothers, the Benjaminites, and said, "Today a tribe has been cut off from Israel.
07Jdg 21:7 What should we do about wives for the survivors? We've sworn to the LORD not to give them any of our daughters as wives."
07Jdg 21:8 They asked, "Which city among the tribes of Israel didn't come to the LORD at Mizpah?" It turned out that no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp and the assembly.
07Jdg 21:9 For when the people were counted, no one was there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead.
07Jdg 21:10 The congregation sent 12,000 brave warriors there and commanded them: "Go and kill the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including women and children.
07Jdg 21:11 This is what you should do: Completely destroy every male, as well as every female who has slept with a man."
07Jdg 21:12 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins, who had not had sexual relations with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
07Jdg 21:13 The whole congregation sent a message of peace to the Benjaminites who were at the rock of Rimmon.
07Jdg 21:14 Benjamin returned at that time, and Israel gave them the women they had kept alive from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough for them.
07Jdg 21:15 The people had compassion on Benjamin, because the LORD had made this gap in the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 21:16 The elders of the congregation said, "What should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?"
07Jdg 21:17 They said, "There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
07Jdg 21:18 But we can't give them our daughters as wives." For the Israelites had sworn: "Anyone who gives a wife to a Benjaminite is cursed."
07Jdg 21:19 They also said, "Look, there's an annual festival to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah."
07Jdg 21:20 Then they commanded the Benjaminites: "Go and hide in the vineyards.
07Jdg 21:21 Watch, and when you see the young women of Shiloh come out to perform the dances, each of you leave the vineyards and catch a wife for yourself from the young women of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
07Jdg 21:22 When their fathers or brothers come to us and protest, we will tell them, 'Show favor to them, since we did not get enough wives for each of them in the battle. You didn't actually give [the women] to them, so you are not guilty [of breaking your oath].'"
07Jdg 21:23 The Benjaminites did this and took the number of women they needed from the dancers they caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and lived in them.
07Jdg 21:24 At that time, each of the Israelites returned from there to his own tribe and family. Each returned from there to his own inheritance.
07Jdg 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did whatever he wanted.

08Ru 1:1 During the time of the judges, there was a famine in the land. A man left Bethlehem in Judah with his wife and two sons to live in the land of Moab for a while.
08Ru 1:2 The man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They entered the land of Moab and [settled] there.
08Ru 1:3 Naomi's husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons.
08Ru 1:4 Her sons took Moabite women as their wives: one was named Orpah and the second was named Ruth. After they lived in Moab about 10 years,
08Ru 1:5 both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two children and without her husband.
08Ru 1:6 She and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab, because she had heard in Moab that the LORD had paid attention to His people's [need] by providing them food.
08Ru 1:7 She left the place where she had been living, accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, and traveled along the road leading back to the land of Judah.
08Ru 1:8 She said to them, "Each of you go back to your mother's home. May the LORD show faithful love to you as you have shown to the dead and to me.
08Ru 1:9 May the LORD enable each of you to find security in the house of your [new] husband." She kissed them, and they wept loudly.
08Ru 1:10 "No," they said to her. "We will go with you to your people."
08Ru 1:11 But Naomi replied, "Return home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands?
08Ru 1:12 Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was [still] hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,
08Ru 1:13 would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying? No, my daughters, [my life] is much too bitter for you [to share], because the LORD's hand has turned against me."
08Ru 1:14 Again they wept loudly, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
08Ru 1:15 Naomi said, "Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law."
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth replied: Do not persuade me to leave you or go back and not follow you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
08Ru 1:17 Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD do this to me, and even more, if anything but death separates you and me.
08Ru 1:18 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her.
08Ru 1:19 The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival and [the local women] exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"
08Ru 1:20 "Don't call me Naomi. Call me Mara," she answered, "for the Almighty has made me very bitter.
08Ru 1:21 I left full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has pronounced [judgment] on me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
08Ru 1:22 So Naomi came back from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
08Ru 2:1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side named Boaz. He was a prominent man of noble character from Elimelech's family.
08Ru 2:2 Ruth the Moabitess asked Naomi, "Will you let me go into the fields and gather fallen grain behind someone who allows me to?" Naomi answered her, "Go ahead, my daughter."
08Ru 2:3 So Ruth left and entered the field to gather [grain] behind the harvesters. She happened to be in the portion of land belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.
08Ru 2:4 Later, when Boaz arrived from Bethlehem, he said to the harvesters, "The LORD be with you." "The LORD bless you," they replied.
08Ru 2:5 Boaz asked his servant who was in charge of the harvesters, "Whose young woman is this?"
08Ru 2:6 The servant answered, "She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.
08Ru 2:7 She asked, 'Will you let me gather fallen grain among the bundles behind the harvesters?' She came and has remained from early morning until now, except that she rested a little in the shelter."
08Ru 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter. Don't go and gather [grain] in another field, and don't leave this one, but stay here close to my young women.
08Ru 2:9 See which field they are harvesting, and follow [them]. Haven't I ordered the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled."
08Ru 2:10 She bowed with her face to the ground and said to him, "Why are you so kind to notice me, although I am a foreigner?"
08Ru 2:11 Boaz answered her, "Everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband's death has been fully reported to me: [how] you left your father and mother, and the land of your birth, and [how] you came to a people you didn't previously know.
08Ru 2:12 May the LORD reward you for what you have done, and may you receive a full reward from the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge."
08Ru 2:13 "My lord," she said, "you have been so kind to me, for you have comforted and encouraged your slave, although I am not like one of your female servants."
08Ru 2:14 At mealtime Boaz told her, "Come over here and have some bread and dip it in the vinegar sauce." So she sat beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain. She ate and was satisfied and had [some] left over.
08Ru 2:15 When she got up to gather [grain], Boaz ordered his young men, "Be sure to let her gather [grain] among the bundles, and don't humiliate her.
08Ru 2:16 Pull out [some] stalks from the bundles for her and leave [them] for her to gather. Don't rebuke her.
08Ru 2:17 So Ruth gathered [grain] in the field until evening. She beat out what she had gathered, and it was about 26 quarts of barley.
08Ru 2:18 She picked up [the grain] and went into the city, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Then she brought out what she had left over from her meal and gave [it] to her.
08Ru 2:19 Then her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you gather [barley] today, and where did you work? May [the LORD] bless the man who noticed you." Ruth told her mother-in-law about the men she had worked [with] and said, "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz."
08Ru 2:20 Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not forsaken his kindness to the living or the dead." Naomi continued, "The man is a close relative. He is one of our family redeemers."
08Ru 2:21 Ruth the Moabitess said, "He also told me, 'Stay with my young men until they have finished all of my harvest.'"
08Ru 2:22 So Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, "My daughter, it is good for you to work with his young women, so that nothing will happen to you in another field."
08Ru 2:23 Ruth stayed close to Boaz's young women and gathered [grain] until the barley and the wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:1 Ruth's mother-in-law Naomi said to her, "My daughter, shouldn't I find security for you, so that you will be taken care of?
08Ru 3:2 Now isn't Boaz our relative? Haven't you been working with his young women? This evening he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
08Ru 3:3 Wash, put on [perfumed] oil, and wear your [best] clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but don't let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
08Ru 3:4 When he lies down, notice the place where he's lying, go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. Then he will explain to you what you should do."
08Ru 3:5 So [Ruth] said to her, "I will do everything you say."
08Ru 3:6 She went down [to] the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her.
08Ru 3:7 After Boaz ate, drank, and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the pile of barley. Then she went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
08Ru 3:8 At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman!
08Ru 3:9 So he asked, "Who are you?" "I am Ruth, your slave," she replied. "Spread your cloak over me, for you are a family redeemer."
08Ru 3:10 Then he said, "May the LORD bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not pursued younger men, whether rich or poor.
08Ru 3:11 Now don't be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you say, since all the people in my town know that you are a woman of noble character.
08Ru 3:12 Yes, it is true that I am a family redeemer, but there is a redeemer closer than I am.
08Ru 3:13 Stay [here] tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, [that's] good. Let him redeem [you]. But if he doesn't want to redeem you, as the LORD lives, I will. Now, lie down until morning."
08Ru 3:14 So she lay down at his feet until morning but got up while it was still dark. Then Boaz said, "Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."
08Ru 3:15 And he told [Ruth], "Bring the shawl you're wearing and hold it out." When she held it out, he shoveled six [measures] of barley into her shawl, and she went into the city.
08Ru 3:16 She went to her mother-in-law, Naomi, who asked [her], "How did it go, my daughter?" Then Ruth told her everything the man had done for her.
08Ru 3:17 She said, "He gave me these six [measures] of barley, because he said, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
08Ru 3:18 "Wait, my daughter," she said, "until you find out how things go, for he won't rest unless he resolves this today."
08Ru 4:1 Boaz went to the gate [of the town] and sat down there. Soon, the family redeemer Boaz had spoken about came by. Boaz called him by name and said, "Come over here and sit down." So he went over and sat down.
08Ru 4:2 Then Boaz took 10 men of the city's elders and said, "Sit here." And they sat down.
08Ru 4:3 He said to the redeemer, "Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling a piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
08Ru 4:4 I thought I should inform you: Buy [it] back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem [it], do so. But if you do not want to redeem [it], tell me, so that I will know, because there isn't anyone other than you to redeem [it], and I am next after you." "I want to redeem [it]," he answered.
08Ru 4:5 Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you will also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased man, to perpetuate the man's name on his property."
08Ru 4:6 The redeemer replied, "I can't redeem [it] myself, or I will ruin my [own] inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can't redeem it."
08Ru 4:7 At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal and gave [it] to the other party in order to make any matter [legally] binding concerning the right of redemption or the exchange of property. This was [the method of] legally binding a transaction in Israel.
08Ru 4:8 So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, "Buy back [the property] yourself."
08Ru 4:9 Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.
08Ru 4:10 I will also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man's name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today."
08Ru 4:11 The elders and all the people who were at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is entering your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you be powerful in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem.
08Ru 4:12 May your house become like the house of Perez, the son Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman."
08Ru 4:13 Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he was intimate with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
08Ru 4:14 Then the women said to Naomi, "Praise the LORD, who has not left you without a family redeemer today. May his name be famous in Israel.
08Ru 4:15 He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. Indeed, your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him."
08Ru 4:16 Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and took care of him.
08Ru 4:17 The neighbor women said, "A son has been born to Naomi," and they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08Ru 4:18 Now this is the genealogy of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron.
08Ru 4:19 Hezron fathered Ram, who fathered Amminadab.
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab fathered Nahshon, who fathered Salmon.
08Ru 4:21 Salmon fathered Boaz, who fathered Obed.
08Ru 4:22 And Obed fathered Jesse, who fathered David.

091Sm 1:1 There was a man from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
091Sm 1:2 He had two wives, the first named Hannah and the second Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless.
091Sm 1:3 This man would go up from his town every year to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were the LORD's priests.
091Sm 1:4 Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he always gave portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to each of her sons and daughters.
091Sm 1:5 But he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved her even though the LORD had kept her from conceiving.
091Sm 1:6 Her rival would taunt her severely just to provoke her, because the LORD had kept Hannah from conceiving.
091Sm 1:7 Whenever she went up to the LORD's house, her rival taunted her in this way every year. Hannah wept and would not eat.
091Sm 1:8 "Hannah, why are you crying?" her husband Elkanah asked. "Why won't you eat? Why are you troubled? Am I not better to you than 10 sons?"
091Sm 1:9 Hannah got up after they ate and drank at Shiloh. Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's tabernacle.
091Sm 1:10 Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears.
091Sm 1:11 Making a vow, she pleaded, "LORD of Hosts, if You will take notice of Your servant's affliction, remember and not forget me, and give Your servant a son, I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and his hair will never be cut."
091Sm 1:12 While she was praying in the LORD's presence, Eli watched her lips.
091Sm 1:13 Hannah was speaking to herself, and although her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. Eli thought she was drunk
091Sm 1:14 and scolded her, "How long are you going to be drunk? Get rid of your wine!"
091Sm 1:15 "No, my lord," Hannah replied. "I am a woman with a broken heart. I haven't had any wine or beer; I've been pouring out my heart before the LORD.
091Sm 1:16 Don't think of me as a wicked woman; I've been praying from the depth of my anguish and resentment."
091Sm 1:17 Eli responded, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the petition you've requested from Him."
091Sm 1:18 "May your servant find favor with you," she replied. Then Hannah went on her way; she ate and no longer appeared downcast.
091Sm 1:19 The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to bow and to worship the LORD. Afterwards, they returned home to Ramah. Then Elkanah was intimate with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.
091Sm 1:20 After some time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, because [she said], "I requested him from the LORD."
091Sm 1:21 When Elkanah and all his household went up to make the annual sacrifice and his vow offering to the LORD,
091Sm 1:22 Hannah did not go and explained to her husband, "After the child is weaned, I'll take him to appear in the LORD's presence and to stay there permanently."
091Sm 1:23 Her husband Elkanah replied, "Do what you think is best, and stay here until you've weaned him. May the LORD confirm your word." So Hannah stayed there and nursed her son until she weaned him.
091Sm 1:24 When she had weaned him, she took him with her to Shiloh, as well as a three-year-old bull, two and one-half gallons of flour, and a jar of wine. Though the boy was [still] young, she took him to the LORD's house at Shiloh.
091Sm 1:25 Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli.
091Sm 1:26 "Please, my lord," she said, "as sure as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.
091Sm 1:27 I prayed for this boy, and since the LORD gave me what I asked Him for,
091Sm 1:28 I now give the boy to the LORD. For as long as he lives, he is given to the LORD." Then he bowed and worshiped the LORD there.
091Sm 2:1 Hannah prayed: My heart rejoices in the LORD; my horn is lifted up by the LORD. My mouth boasts over my enemies, because I rejoice in Your salvation.
091Sm 2:2 There is no one holy like the LORD. There is no one besides You! And there is no rock like our God.
091Sm 2:3 Do not boast so proudly, or let arrogant [words] come out of your mouth, for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and actions are weighed by Him.
091Sm 2:4 The bows of the warriors are broken, but the feeble are clothed with strength.
091Sm 2:5 Those who are full hire themselves out for food, but those who are starving [hunger] no more. The barren woman gives birth to seven, but the woman with many sons pines away.
091Sm 2:6 The LORD brings death and gives life; He sends [some] to Sheol, and He raises [others] up.
091Sm 2:7 The LORD brings poverty and gives wealth; He humbles and He exalts.
091Sm 2:8 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the garbage pile. He seats them with noblemen and gives them a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; He has set the world on them.
091Sm 2:9 He guards the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked are silenced in darkness, for a man does not prevail by [his own] strength.
091Sm 2:10 Those who oppose the LORD will be shattered; He will thunder in the heavens against them. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth. He will give power to His king; He will lift up the horn of His anointed.
091Sm 2:11 Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy served the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.
091Sm 2:12 Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD
091Sm 2:13 or for the priests' share [of the sacrifices] from the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling
091Sm 2:14 and plunge it into the container or kettle or caldron or cooking pot. The priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is the way they treated all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.
091Sm 2:15 Even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest [some] meat to roast, because he won't accept boiled meat from you-- only raw."
091Sm 2:16 If that man said to him, "The fat must be burned first; then you can take whatever you want for yourself," the servant would reply, "No, I insist that you hand it over right now. If you don't, I'll take it by force!"
091Sm 2:17 So the servants' sin was very severe in the presence of the LORD, because they treated the LORD's offering with contempt.
091Sm 2:18 The boy Samuel served in the LORD's presence and wore a linen ephod.
091Sm 2:19 Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
091Sm 2:20 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife: "May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one she has given to the LORD." Then they would go home.
091Sm 2:21 The LORD paid attention to Hannah's [need], and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
091Sm 2:22 Now Eli was very old. He heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
091Sm 2:23 He said to them, "Why are you doing these things? I have heard about your evil actions from all these people.
091Sm 2:24 No, my sons, the report I hear from the LORD's people is not good.
091Sm 2:25 If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him, but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to their father, since the LORD intended to kill them.
091Sm 2:26 By contrast, the boy Samuel grew in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.
091Sm 2:27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says: 'Didn't I reveal Myself to your ancestral house when it was in Egypt and belonged to Pharaoh's palace?
091Sm 2:28 I selected your house from the tribes of Israel to be priests, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave your house all the Israelite fire offerings.
091Sm 2:29 Why, then, do all of you despise My sacrifices and offerings that I require at the place of worship? You have honored your sons more than Me, by making yourselves fat with the best part of all of the offerings of My people Israel.'
091Sm 2:30 "Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Although I said your family and your ancestral house would walk before Me forever, the LORD now says, "No longer!" I will honor those who honor Me, but those who despise Me will be disgraced.
091Sm 2:31 " 'Look, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your ancestral family, so that none in your family will reach old age.
091Sm 2:32 You will see distress [in the] place of worship, in spite of all that is good in Israel, and no one in your family will ever again reach old age.
091Sm 2:33 Any man from your [family] I do not cut off from My altar will bring grief and sadness to you. All your descendents will die violently.
091Sm 2:34 This will be the sign that will come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: both of them will die on the same day.
091Sm 2:35 " 'Then I will raise up a faithful priest for Myself. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. I will establish a lasting dynasty for him, and he will walk before My anointed one for all time.
091Sm 2:36 Anyone who is left in your family will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread. He will say: Please appoint me to some priestly office so I can have a piece of bread to eat.'"
091Sm 3:1 The boy Samuel served the LORD in Eli's presence. In those days the word of the LORD was rare and prophetic visions were not widespread.
091Sm 3:2 One day Eli, whose eyesight was failing, was lying in his room.
091Sm 3:3 Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the tabernacle of the LORD where the ark of God was located.
091Sm 3:4 Then the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:5 He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "I didn't call," Eli replied. "Go and lie down." So he went and lay down.
091Sm 3:6 Once again the LORD called, "Samuel!" Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; you called me." "I didn't call, my son," he replied. "Go and lie down."
091Sm 3:7 Now Samuel had not yet experienced the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
091Sm 3:8 Once again, for the third time, the LORD called Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the boy.
091Sm 3:9 He told Samuel, "Go and lie down. If He calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.' " So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
091Sm 3:10 The LORD came, stood there, and called as before, "Samuel, Samuel!" Samuel responded, "Speak, for Your servant is listening."
091Sm 3:11 The LORD said to Samuel, "I am about to do something in Israel that everyone who hears about it will shudder.
091Sm 3:12 On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I said about his family, from beginning to end.
091Sm 3:13 I told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knows about: his sons are defiling the sanctuary, and he has not stopped them.
091Sm 3:14 Therefore, I have sworn to Eli's family: The iniquity of Eli's family will never be wiped out by either sacrifice or offering."
091Sm 3:15 Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the LORD's house. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
091Sm 3:16 but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." "Here I am," answered Samuel.
091Sm 3:17 "What was the message He gave you?" Eli asked. "Don't hide it from me. May God punish you and do so severely if you hide anything from me that He told you."
091Sm 3:18 So Samuel told him everything and did not hide anything from him. Eli responded, "He is the LORD. He will do what He thinks is good."
091Sm 3:19 Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let nothing he said prove false.
091Sm 3:20 All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the LORD.
091Sm 3:21 The LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word.
091Sm 4:1 And Samuel's words came to all Israel. Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines lined up in battle formation against Israel, and as the battle intensified, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about 4,000 men on the battlefield.
091Sm 4:3 When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD let us be defeated today by the Philistines? Let's bring the ark of the LORD's covenant from Shiloh. Then it will go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."
091Sm 4:4 So the people sent [men] to Shiloh to bring back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts, who dwells [between] the cherubim. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
091Sm 4:5 When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a loud shout that the ground shook.
091Sm 4:6 The Philistines heard the sound of the war cry and asked, "What's this loud shout in the Hebrews' camp?" When the Philistines discovered that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp,
091Sm 4:7 they panicked. "The gods have entered their camp!" they said. "Woe to us, nothing like this has happened before.
091Sm 4:8 Woe to us, who will rescue us from the hand of these magnificent gods? These are the gods that slaughtered the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
091Sm 4:9 Show some courage and be men, Philistines! Otherwise, you'll serve the Hebrews just like they served you. Now be men and fight!"
091Sm 4:10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was severe-- 30,000 of the Israelite foot soldiers fell.
091Sm 4:11 The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
091Sm 4:12 That same day, a Benjaminite man ran from the battle and came to Shiloh. His clothes were torn, and there was dirt on his head.
091Sm 4:13 When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair beside the road watching, because he was anxious about the ark of God. When the man entered the city to give a report, the entire city cried out.
091Sm 4:14 Eli heard the outcry and asked, "Why this commotion?" The man quickly came and reported to Eli.
091Sm 4:15 At that time Eli was 98 years old, and his gaze was fixed because he couldn't see.
091Sm 4:16 The man said to Eli, "I'm the one who came from the battle. I fled from there today." "What happened, my son?" Eli asked.
091Sm 4:17 The messenger answered, "Israel has fled from the Philistines, and also there was a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 4:18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backwards off the chair by the city gate, and since he was old and heavy, his neck broke and he died. Eli had judged Israel 40 years.
091Sm 4:19 Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news about the capture of God's ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth because her labor pains came on her.
091Sm 4:20 As she was dying, the women taking care of her said, "Don't be afraid. You've given birth to a son!" But she did not respond, and did not pay attention.
091Sm 4:21 She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," referring to the capture of the ark of God and to [the deaths of] her father-in-law and her husband.
091Sm 4:22 "The glory has departed from Israel," she said, "because the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 5:1 After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod,
091Sm 5:2 brought it into the temple of Dagonand placed it next to his statue.
091Sm 5:3 When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.
091Sm 5:4 But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. [This time], both Dagon's head and the palms of his hands were broken off and lying on the threshold. Only Dagon's torso remained.
091Sm 5:5 That is why, to this day, the priests of Dagon and everyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on Dagon's threshold.
091Sm 5:6 The LORD severely oppressed the people of Ashdod, terrorizing and afflicting the people of Ashdod and its territory with tumors.
091Sm 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of Israel's God must not stay here with us, because His hand is severe against us and our god Dagon."
091Sm 5:8 So they called all the Philistine rulers together and asked, "What should we do with the ark of Israel's God?" "The ark of Israel's God should be moved to Gath," they replied. So the men of Ashdod moved the ark.
091Sm 5:9 After they had moved it, the LORD's hand was against the city of Gath, causing a great panic. He afflicted the men of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, with an outbreak of tumors.
091Sm 5:10 The Gathites then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it got there, the Ekronites cried out, "They've moved the ark of Israel's God to us to kill us and our people!"
091Sm 5:11 The Ekronites called all the Philistine rulers together. They said, "Send the ark of Israel's God away. It must return to its place so it won't kill us and our people!" For the fear of death pervaded the city; God's hand was very heavy there.
091Sm 5:12 The men who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
091Sm 6:1 When the ark of the LORD had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,
091Sm 6:2 the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners and pleaded, "What should we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we can send it back to its place."
091Sm 6:3 They replied, "If you send the ark of Israel's God away, you must not send it without [an offering]. You must return it with a guilt offering, and you will be healed. Then the reason His hand hasn't been removed from you will be revealed."
091Sm 6:4 They asked, "What guilt offering should we send back to Him?" And they answered, "Five gold tumors and five gold mice [corresponding to] the number of Philistine rulers, since there was one plague for both you and your rulers.
091Sm 6:5 Make images of your tumors and of your mice that are destroying the land. Give glory to Israel's God, and perhaps He will stop oppressing you, your gods, and your land.
091Sm 6:6 Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? When He afflicted them, didn't they send Israel away, and Israel left?
091Sm 6:7 "Now then, prepare one new cart and two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.
091Sm 6:8 Take the ark of the LORD, place it on the cart, and put the gold objects in a box beside it, which you're sending Him as a guilt offering. Send it off and let it go its way.
091Sm 6:9 Then watch: If it goes up the road to its homeland toward Beth-shemesh, it is the LORD who has made this terrible trouble for us. However, if it doesn't, we will know that it was not His hand that punished us-- it was just something that happened to us by chance."
091Sm 6:10 The men did this: They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and confined their calves in the pen.
091Sm 6:11 Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the box [containing] the gold mice and the images of the tumors.
091Sm 6:12 The cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on that one highway, lowing as they went; they never strayed to the right or to the left. The Philistine rulers were walking behind them to the territory of Beth-shemesh.
091Sm 6:13 The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed to see it.
091Sm 6:14 The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people of the city chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
091Sm 6:15 The Levites removed the ark of the LORD, along with the box containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. That day the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.
091Sm 6:16 When the five Philistine rulers observed [this], they returned to Ekron that same day.
091Sm 6:17 As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines had sent back one gold tumor for each city: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
091Sm 6:18 The number of gold mice also [corresponded] to the number of Philistine cities of the five rulers, the fortified cities and the outlying villages. The large rock on which the ark of the LORD was placed is in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh to this day.
091Sm 6:19 God struck down the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the LORD.He struck down 70 men [out of] 50,000 men. The people wept because the LORD struck them with a great slaughter.
091Sm 6:20 The men of Beth-shemesh asked, "Who is able to stand in the presence of this holy LORD God? Who should the ark go to from here?"
091Sm 6:21 They sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and get it."
091Sm 7:1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the LORD and took it to Abinadab's house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to take care of it.
091Sm 7:2 Time went by until 20 years had passed since the ark had been taken to Kiriath-jearim. Then the whole house of Israel began to seek the LORD.
091Sm 7:3 Samuel told them, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, get rid of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths that are among you, dedicate yourselves to the LORD, and worship only Him. Then He will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:4 So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths and only worshiped the LORD.
091Sm 7:5 Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf."
091Sm 7:6 When they gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out in the LORD's presence. They fasted that day, and there they confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel [began to lead] the Israelites at Mizpah as [their] judge.
091Sm 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. When the Israelites heard [about it], they were afraid because of the Philistines.
091Sm 7:8 The Israelites said to Samuel, "Don't stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, so that He will save us from the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:9 Then Samuel took a young lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him.
091Sm 7:10 Samuel was offering the burnt offering as the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel. The LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines that day and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel.
091Sm 7:11 Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines striking them down all the way to a place below Beth-car.
091Sm 7:12 Afterwards, Samuel took a stone and set it upright between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, explaining, "The LORD has helped us to this point."
091Sm 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israel's territory again. The LORD's hand was against the Philistines all of Samuel's life.
091Sm 7:14 The cities from Ekron to Gath, which they had taken from Israel, were restored; Israel even rescued their surrounding territories from Philistine control. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
091Sm 7:15 Samuel judged Israel throughout his life.
091Sm 7:16 Every year he would go on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah and would judge Israel at all these locations.
091Sm 7:17 Then he would return to Ramah because his home was there, he judged Israel there, and he had built an altar to the LORD there.
091Sm 8:1 When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
091Sm 8:2 His firstborn son's name was Joel and his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba.
091Sm 8:3 However, his sons did not walk in his ways-- they turned toward dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
091Sm 8:4 So all the elders of Israel gathered together and went to Samuel at Ramah.
091Sm 8:5 They said to him, "Look, you are old, and your sons do not follow your example. Therefore, appoint a king to judge us the same as all the other nations have."
091Sm 8:6 When they said, "Give us a king to judge us," Samuel considered their demand sinful, so he prayed to the LORD.
091Sm 8:7 But the LORD told him, "Listen to the people and everything they say to you. They have rejected you; they have rejected Me as their king.
091Sm 8:8 They are doing the same thing to you that they have done to Me, since the day I brought them out of Egypt until this day, abandoning Me and worshiping other gods.
091Sm 8:9 Listen to them, but you must solemnly warn them and tell them about the rights of the king who will rule over them."
091Sm 8:10 Samuel told all the LORD's words to the people who were asking him for a king.
091Sm 8:11 He said, "These are the rights of the king who will rule over you: He can take your sons and put them to his use in his chariots, on his horses, or running in front of his chariots.
091Sm 8:12 He can appoint them for his use as commanders of thousands or commanders of fifties, to plow his ground or reap his harvest, or to make his weapons of war or the equipment for his chariots.
091Sm 8:13 He can take your daughters to become perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
091Sm 8:14 He can take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
091Sm 8:15 He can take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards and give them to his officials and servants.
091Sm 8:16 He can take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys and use them for his work.
091Sm 8:17 He can take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves can become his servants.
091Sm 8:18 When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you've chosen for yourselves, but the LORD won't answer you on that day."
091Sm 8:19 The people refused to listen to Samuel. "No!" they said. "We must have a king over us.
091Sm 8:20 Then we'll be like all the other nations: our king will judge us, go out before us, and fight our battles."
091Sm 8:21 Samuel listened to all the people's words and then repeated them to the LORD.
091Sm 8:22 "Listen to them," the LORD told Samuel. "Appoint a king for them." Then Samuel told the men of Israel, "Each of you, go back to your city."
091Sm 9:1 There was an influential man of Benjamin named Kish son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, son of a Benjaminite.
091Sm 9:2 He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man. There was no one more impressive among the Israelites than he. He stood a head taller than anyone else.
091Sm 9:3 One day the donkeys of Saul's father Kish wandered off. Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the attendants with you and go look for the donkeys."
091Sm 9:4 Saul and his attendant went through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the region of Shalishah, but they didn't find them. They went through the region of Shaalim-- nothing. Then they went through the Benjaminite region but still didn't find them.
091Sm 9:5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the attendant who was with him, "Come on, let's go back, or my father will stop [worrying] about the donkeys and start worrying about us."
091Sm 9:6 "Look," the attendant said, "there's a man of God in this city who is highly respected; everything he says is sure to come true. Let's go there now. Maybe he'll tell us which way we should go."
091Sm 9:7 "Suppose we do go," Saul said to his attendant, "what do we take the man? The food from our packs is gone, and there's no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"
091Sm 9:8 The attendant answered Saul: "Here, I have a piece of silver. I'll give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way."
091Sm 9:9 Formerly in Israel, a man who was going to inquire of God would say, "Come, let's go to the seer," for the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.
091Sm 9:10 "Good," Saul replied to his attendant. "Come on, let's go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
091Sm 9:11 As they were climbing the hill to the city, they found some young women coming out to draw water and asked, "Is the seer here?"
091Sm 9:12 The women answered, "Yes, he is ahead of you. Hurry, he just now came to the city, because there's a sacrifice for the people at the high place today.
091Sm 9:13 If you go quickly, you can catch up with him before he goes to the high place to eat. The people won't eat until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests can eat. Go up immediately-- you can find him now."
091Sm 9:14 So they went up toward the city. Saul and his attendant were entering the city when they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place.
091Sm 9:15 Now the day before Saul's arrival, the LORD had informed Samuel,
091Sm 9:16 "At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over My people Israel. He will save them from the hand of the Philistines because I have seen [the affliction of] My people, for their cry has come to Me."
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "Here is the man I told you about; he will rule over My people."
091Sm 9:18 Saul approached Samuel in the gate area and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"
091Sm 9:19 "I am the seer," Samuel answered. "Go up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today. When I send you off in the morning, I'll tell you everything that's in your heart.
091Sm 9:20 As for the donkeys that wandered away from you three days ago, don't worry about them because they've been found. And who does all Israel desire but you and all your father's family?"
091Sm 9:21 Saul responded, "Am I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel's tribes and isn't my clan the least important of all the clans of the Benjaminite tribe? So why have you said something like this to me?"
091Sm 9:22 Samuel took Saul and his attendant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the 30 or so men who had been invited.
091Sm 9:23 Then Samuel said to the cook, "Get the portion of meat that I gave you and told you to set aside."
091Sm 9:24 The cook picked up the thigh and what was attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, "Notice that the reserved piece is set before you. Eat it because it was saved for you for this solemn event at the time I said, 'I've invited the people.' " So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
091Sm 9:25 Afterwards, they went down from the high place to the city, and Samuel spoke with Saul on [the] roof.
091Sm 9:26 They got up early, and just before dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, and I'll send you on your way!" Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside.
091Sm 9:27 As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the attendant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for awhile, and I'll reveal the word of God to you." So the attendant went on.
091Sm 10:1 Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it out on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, "Hasn't the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance?
091Sm 10:2 Today when you leave me, you'll find two men at Rachel's Grave at Zelzah in the land of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you went looking for have been found, and now your father has stopped being concerned about the donkeys and is worried about you, asking: What should I do about my son?'
091Sm 10:3 "You will proceed from there until you come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one bringing three goats, one bringing three loaves of bread, and one bringing a skin of wine.
091Sm 10:4 They will ask how you are and give you two [loaves of] bread, which you will accept from them.
091Sm 10:5 "After that you will come to the Hill of God where there are Philistine garrisons. When you arrive at the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place prophesying. They will be preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres.
091Sm 10:6 The Spirit of the LORD will control you, you will prophesy with them, and you will be transformed into a different person.
091Sm 10:7 When these signs have happened to you, do whatever your circumstances require because God is with you.
091Sm 10:8 Afterwards, go ahead of me to Gilgal. I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice fellowship offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do."
091Sm 10:9 When Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God changed his heart, and all the signs came about that day.
091Sm 10:10 When Saul and his attendant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God took control of him, and he prophesied along with them.
091Sm 10:11 Everyone who knew him previously and saw him prophesy with the prophets asked each other, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 10:12 Then a man who was from there asked, "And who is their father?" As a result, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" became a popular saying.
091Sm 10:13 Then Saul finished prophesying and went to the high place.
091Sm 10:14 Saul's uncle asked him and his attendant, "Where did you go?" "To look for the donkeys," Saul answered. "When we saw they weren't there, we went to Samuel."
091Sm 10:15 "Tell me," Saul's uncle asked, "what did Samuel say to you?"
091Sm 10:16 Saul told him, "He assured us the donkeys had been found." However, Saul did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship.
091Sm 10:17 Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah
091Sm 10:18 and said to the Israelites, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'
091Sm 10:19 But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions. You said to Him, 'You must set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans."
091Sm 10:20 Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected.
091Sm 10:21 Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the Matrite clan was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they searched for him, they could not find him.
091Sm 10:22 They again inquired of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" The LORD replied, "There he is, hidden among the supplies."
091Sm 10:23 They ran and got him from there. When he stood among the people, he stood a head taller than anyone else.
091Sm 10:24 Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the one the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among the entire population." And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
091Sm 10:25 Samuel proclaimed to the people the rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll, which he placed in the presence of the LORD. Then, Samuel sent all the people away, each to his home.
091Sm 10:26 Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, and brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him.
091Sm 10:27 But some wicked men said, "How can this guy save us?" They despised him and did not bring him a gift, but Saul said nothing.
091Sm 11:1 Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you."
091Sm 11:2 Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I'll make one with you on this condition: that I gouge out everyone's right eye and humiliate all Israel."
091Sm 11:3 "Don't do anything to us for seven days," the elders of Jabesh said to him, "and let us send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If no one saves us, we will surrender to you."
091Sm 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah, Saul's [hometown], and told the terms to the people, all wept aloud.
091Sm 11:5 Just then Saul was coming in from the field behind his oxen. "What's the matter with the people? Why are they weeping?" Saul inquired, and they repeated to him the words of the men from Jabesh.
091Sm 11:6 When Saul heard these words, the Spirit of God suddenly took control of him, and his anger burned furiously.
091Sm 11:7 He took a team of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the land of Israel by messengers who said, "This is what will be done to the ox of anyone who doesn't march behind Saul and Samuel."As a result, the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they went out united.
091Sm 11:8 Saul counted them at Bezek. There were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men from Judah.
091Sm 11:9 He told the messengers who had come, "Tell this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: 'Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.' " So the messengers told the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
091Sm 11:10 Then the men of Jabesh said to [Nahash], "Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do whatever you want to us."
091Sm 11:11 The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions. During the morning watch, they invaded the Ammonite camp and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. There were survivors, but they were so scattered that no two of them were left together.
091Sm 11:12 Afterwards, the people said to Samuel, "Who said that Saul should not reign over us? Give us those men so we can kill them!"
091Sm 11:13 But Saul ordered, "No one will be executed this day, for today the LORD has provided deliverance in Israel."
091Sm 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let's go to Gilgal, so we can renew the kingship there."
091Sm 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there in the LORD's presence they made Saul king. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings in the LORD's presence, and Saul and all the men of Israel greatly rejoiced.
091Sm 12:1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, "I have carefully listened to everything you said to me and placed a king over you.
091Sm 12:2 But now, you can see that the king is leading you. As for me, I'm old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have led you from my youth until today.
091Sm 12:3 Here I am. Bring charges against me before the LORD and His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I wronged or mistreated? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to overlook something?I will return it to you."
091Sm 12:4 "You haven't wronged us, you haven't mistreated us, and you haven't taken anything from anyone's hand," they responded.
091Sm 12:5 He said to them, "The LORD is a witness against you, and His anointed is a witness today that you haven't found anything in my hand." "[He is] a witness," they said.
091Sm 12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, "The LORD, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt, is a witness.
091Sm 12:7 Now present yourselves, so I may judge you before the LORD about all the righteous acts He has done for you and your ancestors.
091Sm 12:8 "When Jacob went to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the LORD, and He sent them Moses and Aaron, who led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
091Sm 12:9 But they forgot the LORD their God, so He handed them over to Sisera commander of the army of Hazor, to the Philistines, and to the king of Moab. [These enemies] fought against them.
091Sm 12:10 Then they cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned, for we abandoned the LORD and worshiped the Baals and the Ashtoreths. Now deliver us from the power of our enemies, and we will serve You.'
091Sm 12:11 So the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel. He rescued you from the power of the enemies around you, and you lived securely.
091Sm 12:12 But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was coming against you, you said to me, 'No, we must have a king rule over us'-- even though the LORD your God is your king.
091Sm 12:13 "Now here is the king you've chosen, the one you requested. Look, this is the king the LORD has placed over you.
091Sm 12:14 If you fear the LORD, worship and obey Him, and if you don't rebel against the LORD's command, then both you and the king who rules over you will follow the LORD your God.
091Sm 12:15 However, if you disobey the LORD and rebel against His command, the LORD's hand will be against you and against your ancestors.
091Sm 12:16 "Now, therefore, present yourselves and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
091Sm 12:17 Isn't the wheat harvest today? I will call on the LORD and He will send thunder and rain, so that you will know and see what a great evil you committed in the LORD's sight by requesting a king for yourselves."
091Sm 12:18 Samuel called on the LORD, and on that day the LORD sent thunder and rain. As a result, all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
091Sm 12:19 They pleaded with Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants, so we won't die! For we have added to all our sins the evil of requesting a king for ourselves."
091Sm 12:20 Samuel replied, "Don't be afraid. Even though you have committed all this evil, don't turn away from following the LORD. Instead, worship the LORD with all your heart.
091Sm 12:21 Don't turn away to follow worthless things that can't profit or deliver you; they are worthless.
091Sm 12:22 The LORD will not abandon His people, because of His great name and because He has determined to make you His own people.
091Sm 12:23 "As for me, I vow that I will not sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you. I will teach you the good and right way.
091Sm 12:24 Above all, fear the LORD and worship Him faithfully with all your heart, considering the great things He has done for you.
091Sm 12:25 However, if you continue to do what is evil, both you and your king will be swept away."
091Sm 13:1 Saul was 30 years old when he became king, and he reigned 42 years over Israel.
091Sm 13:2 He chose 3,000 men from Israel for himself: 2,000 were with Saul at Michmash and in Bethel's hill country, and 1,000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the troops away, each to his own tent.
091Sm 13:3 Jonathan attacked the Philistine garrison that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram's horn throughout the land saying, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
091Sm 13:4 And all Israel heard the news, "Saul has attacked the Philistine garrison, and Israel is now repulsive to the Philistines." Then the troops were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
091Sm 13:5 The Philistines also gathered to fight against Israel: 3,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
091Sm 13:6 The men of Israel saw that they were in trouble because the troops were in a difficult situation. They hid in caves, thickets, among rocks, and in holes and cisterns.
091Sm 13:7 Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, was still at Gilgal, and all his troops were gripped with fear.
091Sm 13:8 He waited seven days for the appointed time that Samuel had set, but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal, and the troops were deserting him.
091Sm 13:9 So Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." Then he offered the burnt offering.
091Sm 13:10 Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to greet him,
091Sm 13:11 and Samuel asked, "What have you done?" Saul answered, "When I saw that the troops were deserting me and you didn't come within the appointed days and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,
091Sm 13:12 I thought: The Philistines will now descend on me at Gilgal, and I haven't sought the LORD's favor. So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering."
091Sm 13:13 Samuel said to Saul, "You have been foolish. You have not kept the command which the LORD your God gave you. It was at this time that the LORD would have permanently established your reign over Israel,
091Sm 13:14 but now your reign will not endure. The LORD has found a man loyal to Him,and the LORD has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not done what the LORD commanded."
091Sm 13:15 Then Samuel went from Gilgal to Gibeah in Benjamin. Saul registered the troops who were with him, about 600 men.
091Sm 13:16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the troops who were with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines were camped at Michmash.
091Sm 13:17 Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three divisions. One division headed toward the Ophrah road leading to the land of Shual.
091Sm 13:18 The next division headed toward the Beth-horon road, and the last division headed down the border road that looks out over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
091Sm 13:19 No blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise, the Hebrews will make swords or spears."
091Sm 13:20 So all the Israelites went to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.
091Sm 13:21 The price was two-thirds of a shekel for plowshares and mattocks, and one-third [of a shekel] for pitchforks and axes, and for putting a point on an oxgoad.
091Sm 13:22 So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hand of any of the troops who were with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had [weapons].
091Sm 13:23 Now a Philistine garrison took control of the pass at Michmash.
091Sm 14:1 That same day Saul's son Jonathan said to the attendant who carried his weapons, "Come on, let's cross over to the Philistine garrison on the other side." However, he did not tell his father.
091Sm 14:2 Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah. The troops with him numbered about 600.
091Sm 14:3 Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod, [was also there]. He was the son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod son of Phinehas, son of Eli the LORD's priest at Shiloh. But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left.
091Sm 14:4 There were sharp columns of rock on both sides of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine garrison. One was named Bozez and the other Seneh;
091Sm 14:5 one stood to the north in front of Michmash and the other to the south in front of Geba.
091Sm 14:6 Jonathan said to the attendant who carried his weapons, "Come on, let's cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will help us. Nothing can keep the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."
091Sm 14:7 His armor-bearer responded, "Do what is in your heart. You choose. I'm right here with you whatever you decide."
091Sm 14:8 "All right," Jonathan replied, "we'll cross over to the men and then let them see us.
091Sm 14:9 If they say, 'Wait until we reach you,' then we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
091Sm 14:10 But if they say, 'Come on up,' then we'll go up, because the LORD has handed them over to us-- that will be our sign."
091Sm 14:11 They let themselves be seen by the Philistine garrison, and the Philistines said, "Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they've been hiding!"
091Sm 14:12 The men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armor-bearer. "Come on up, and we'll teach you a lesson!" they said. "Follow me," Jonathan told his armor-bearer, "for the LORD has handed them over to Israel."
091Sm 14:13 Jonathan went up using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. Jonathan cut them down, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off.
091Sm 14:14 In that first assault Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down about 20 men in a half-acre field.
091Sm 14:15 Terror spread through the [Philistine] camp and the open fields to all the troops. Even the garrison and the raiding parties were terrified. The earth shook, and terror from God spread.
091Sm 14:16 When Saul's watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, they saw the panicking troops scattering in every direction.
091Sm 14:17 So Saul said to the troops with him, "Call the roll and determine who has left us." They called the roll and saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were gone.
091Sm 14:18 Saul told Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God," for it was with the Israelites at that time.
091Sm 14:19 While Saul spoke to the priest, the panic in the Philistine camp increased in intensity. So Saul said to the priest, "Stop what you're doing."
091Sm 14:20 Saul and all the troops with him assembled and marched to the battle, and there, the Philistines were fighting against each other in great confusion!
091Sm 14:21 There were Hebrews from the area who had gone earlier into the camp to join the Philistines, but even they joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
091Sm 14:22 When all the Israelite men who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also joined Saul and Jonathan in the battle.
091Sm 14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day. The battle extended beyond Beth-aven,
091Sm 14:24 and the men of Israel were worn out that day, for Saul had placed the troops under an oath: "Cursed is the man who eats food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies." So none of the troops tasted [any] food.
091Sm 14:25 Everyone went into the forest, and there was honey on the ground.
091Sm 14:26 When the troops entered the forest, they saw the flow of honey, but none of them ate any of it because they feared the oath.
091Sm 14:27 However, Jonathan had not heard his father make the troops swear the oath. He reached out with the end of the staff he was carrying and dipped it into the honeycomb. When he ate the honey, he had renewed energy.
091Sm 14:28 Then, one of the troops said, "Your father made the troops solemnly swear, 'Cursed is the man who eats food today,' and the troops are exhausted."
091Sm 14:29 Jonathan replied, "My father has brought trouble to the land. Just look at how I have renewed energy because I tasted a little honey.
091Sm 14:30 How much better if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Then the slaughter of the Philistines would have been much greater."
091Sm 14:31 The Israelites struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash all the way to Aijalon. Since the Israelites were completely exhausted,
091Sm 14:32 they rushed to the plunder, took sheep, cattle, and calves, slaughtered them on the ground, and ate [meat] with the blood [still in it.]
091Sm 14:33 Some reported to Saul: "Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating [meat] with the blood [still in it.]" Saul said, "You have been unfaithful. Roll a large stone over here at once."
091Sm 14:34 He then said, "Go among the troops and say to them, 'Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep. Do the slaughtering here and then you can eat. Don't sin against the LORD by eating [meat] with the blood [in it.]' " So every one of the troops brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
091Sm 14:35 Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD.
091Sm 14:36 Saul said, "Let's go down after the Philistines tonight and plunder them until morning. Don't let even one remain!" "Do whatever you want," the troops replied. But the priest said, "We must consult God here."
091Sm 14:37 So Saul inquired of God, "Should I go after the Philistines? Will You hand them over to Israel?" But God did not answer him that day.
091Sm 14:38 Saul said, "All you leaders of the troops, come here. Let us investigate how this sin has occurred today.
091Sm 14:39 As surely as the LORD lives who saves Israel, even if it is because of my son Jonathan, he must die!" Not one of the troops answered him.
091Sm 14:40 So he said to all Israel, "You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side." And the troops replied, "Do whatever you want."
091Sm 14:41 So Saul said to the LORD, "God of Israel, give us the right [decision]." Jonathan and Saul were selected, and the troops were cleared [of the charge].
091Sm 14:42 Then Saul said, "Cast [the lot] between me and my son Jonathan," and Jonathan was selected.
091Sm 14:43 Saul commanded him, "Tell me what you did." Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the end of the staff I was carrying. I am ready to die!"
091Sm 14:44 Saul declared to him, "May God punish me severely if you do not die, Jonathan!"
091Sm 14:45 But the people said to Saul, "Must Jonathan die, who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? No, as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he worked with God's help today." So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.
091Sm 14:46 Then Saul gave up the pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own territory.
091Sm 14:47 When Saul assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies in every direction: against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he caused havoc.
091Sm 14:48 He fought bravely, defeated the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hand of those who plundered them.
091Sm 14:49 Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: Merab, his firstborn, and Michal, the younger.
091Sm 14:50 The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Saul's uncle Ner.
091Sm 14:51 Saul's father was Kish. Abner's father was Ner son of Abiel.
091Sm 14:52 The conflict with the Philistines was fierce all of Saul's days, so whenever Saul noticed any strong or brave man, he enlisted him.
091Sm 15:1 Samuel told Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people Israel. Now, listen to the words of the LORD.
091Sm 15:2 This is what the LORD of Hosts says: 'I witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they opposed them along the way as they were coming out of Egypt.
091Sm 15:3 Now go and attack the Amalekites and completely destroy everything they have. Do not spare them. Kill men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"
091Sm 15:4 Then Saul summoned the troops and counted them at Telaim: 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men from Judah.
091Sm 15:5 Saul came to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the wadi.
091Sm 15:6 He warned the Kenites, "Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came out of Egypt, go on and leave! Get away from the Amalekites, or I'll sweep you away with them." So the Kenites withdrew from the Amalekites.
091Sm 15:7 Then Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is next to Egypt.
091Sm 15:8 He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but he completely destroyed all the rest of the people with the sword.
091Sm 15:9 Saul and the troops spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, cattle, and fatlings, as well as the young rams and the best of everything else. They were not willing to destroy them, but they did destroy all the worthless and unwanted things.
091Sm 15:10 Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel:
091Sm 15:11 "I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions." So Samuel became angry and cried out to the LORD [all] night.
091Sm 15:12 Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but it was reported to Samuel, "Saul went to Carmel where he set up a monument for himself. Then he turned around and went down to Gilgal."
091Sm 15:13 When Samuel came to him, Saul said, "May the LORD bless you. I have carried out the LORD's instructions."
091Sm 15:14 Samuel replied, "Then what is this sound of sheep and cattle I hear?"
091Sm 15:15 Saul answered, "The troops brought them from the Amalekites and spared the best sheep and cattle in order to offer a sacrifice to the LORD your God, but the rest we destroyed."
091Sm 15:16 "Stop!" exclaimed Samuel. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," he replied.
091Sm 15:17 Samuel continued, "Although you once considered yourself unimportant, have you not become the leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel
091Sm 15:18 and then sent you on a mission and said: 'Go and completely destroy the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until you have annihilated them.'
091Sm 15:19 So why didn't you obey the LORD? Why did you rush on the plunder and do what was evil in the LORD's sight?"
091Sm 15:20 "But I did obey the LORD!" Saul answered. "I went on the mission the LORD gave me: I brought back Agag, king of Amalek, and I completely destroyed the Amalekites.
091Sm 15:21 The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder-- the best of what was set apart for destruction-- to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
091Sm 15:22 Then Samuel said: Does the LORD take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? Look: to obey is better than sacrifice, to pay attention [is better] than the fat of rams.
091Sm 15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and defiance is like wickedness and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king.
091Sm 15:24 Saul answered Samuel, "I have sinned. I have transgressed the LORD's command and your words. Because I was afraid of the people, I obeyed them.
091Sm 15:25 Now therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship the LORD."
091Sm 15:26 Samuel replied to Saul, "I will not return with you. Because you rejected the word of the LORD, the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
091Sm 15:27 When Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore.
091Sm 15:28 Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingship of Israel away from you today and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.
091Sm 15:29 Furthermore, the Eternal One of Israel does not lie or change His mind, for He is not man who changes his mind."
091Sm 15:30 Saul said, "I have sinned. Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come back with me so I can bow and worship the LORD your God."
091Sm 15:31 Then Samuel went back, following Saul, and Saul bowed down to the LORD.
091Sm 15:32 Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of Amalek." Agag came to him trembling, for he thought, "Certainly the bitterness of death has come."
091Sm 15:33 Samuel declared: As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women. Then he hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
091Sm 15:34 Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
091Sm 15:35 Even to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted He had made Saul king over Israel.
091Sm 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, "How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem because I have selected a king from his sons."
091Sm 16:2 Samuel asked, "How can I go? Saul will hear [about it] and kill me!" The LORD answered, "Take a young cow with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
091Sm 16:3 Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you are to do. You are to anoint for Me the one I indicate to you."
091Sm 16:4 Samuel did what the LORD directed and went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled and asked, "Do you come in peace?"
091Sm 16:5 "In peace," he replied. "I've come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
091Sm 16:6 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and said, "Certainly the LORD's anointed one is here before Him."
091Sm 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or his stature, because I have rejected him. Man does not see what the LORD sees, for man sees what is visible, but the LORD sees the heart."
091Sm 16:8 Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. "The LORD hasn't chosen this one either," Samuel said.
091Sm 16:9 Then Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, "The LORD hasn't chosen this one either."
091Sm 16:10 After Jesse presented seven of his sons to him, Samuel told Jesse, "The LORD hasn't chosen any of these."
091Sm 16:11 Samuel asked him, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," he answered, "but right now he's tending the sheep." Samuel told Jesse, "Send for him. We won't sit down to eat until he gets here."
091Sm 16:12 So Jesse sent for him. He had beautiful eyes and a healthy, handsome appearance. Then the LORD said, "Anoint him, for he is the one."
091Sm 16:13 So Samuel took the horn of oil, anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD took control of David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah.
091Sm 16:14 Now the Spirit of the LORD had left Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD began to torment him,
091Sm 16:15 so Saul's servants said to him, "You see that an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
091Sm 16:16 Let our lord command your servants here in your presence to look for someone who knows how to play the harp. Whenever the evil spirit from God [troubles] you, that person can play the harp, and you will feel better."
091Sm 16:17 Then Saul commanded his servants, "Find me someone who plays well and bring him to me."
091Sm 16:18 One of the young men answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play [the harp]. He is also a valiant man, a warrior, eloquent, handsome, and the LORD is with him."
091Sm 16:19 Then Saul dispatched messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."
091Sm 16:20 So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat and sent them by his son David to Saul.
091Sm 16:21 When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul admired him greatly, and David became his armor-bearer.
091Sm 16:22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse: "Let David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him."
091Sm 16:23 Whenever the spirit from God [troubled] Saul, David would pick up his harp and play, and Saul would then be relieved, feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
091Sm 17:1 The Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah and camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
091Sm 17:2 Saul and the men of Israel gathered and camped in the Valley of Elah; then they lined up in battle formation to face the Philistines.
091Sm 17:3 The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites were standing on another hill with a ravine between them.
091Sm 17:4 Then a champion named Goliath, from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was nine feet, nine inches tall
091Sm 17:5 and wore a bronze helmet and bronze scale armor that weighed 125 pounds.
091Sm 17:6 There was bronze armor on his shins, and a bronze sword was slung between his shoulders.
091Sm 17:7 His spear shaft was like a weaver's beam, and the iron point of his spear weighed 15 pounds. In addition, a shield-bearer was walking in front of him.
091Sm 17:8 He stood and shouted to the battle formations: "Why do you come out to line up in battle formation?" He asked them, "Am I not a Philistine and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me.
091Sm 17:9 If he wins in a fight against me and kills me, we will be your servants. But if I win against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us."
091Sm 17:10 Then the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel today. Send me a man so we can fight each other!"
091Sm 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they lost their courage and were terrified.
091Sm 17:12 Now David was the son of the Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah named Jesse. Jesse had eight sons, and during Saul's reign was [already] an old man.
091Sm 17:13 Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war, and their names were Eliab, the firstborn, Abinadab, the next, and Shammah, the third,
091Sm 17:14 and David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul,
091Sm 17:15 but David kept going back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock in Bethlehem.
091Sm 17:16 Every morning and evening for 40 days the Philistine came forward and took his stand.
091Sm 17:17 [One day], Jesse had told his son David, "Take this half-bushel of roasted grain along with these loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
091Sm 17:18 Also, take these 10 portions of cheese to the field commander. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring a confirmation from them.
091Sm 17:19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel are in the Valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines."
091Sm 17:20 So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with someone to keep it, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He arrived at the perimeter of the camp as the army was marching out to its battle formation shouting their battle cry.
091Sm 17:21 Israel and the Philistines lined up in battle formation facing each other.
091Sm 17:22 David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were.
091Sm 17:23 While he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistine battle line and shouted his usual words, which David heard.
091Sm 17:24 When all the Israelite men saw Goliath, they retreated from him terrified.
091Sm 17:25 Previously, an Israelite man had declared, "Do you see this man who keeps coming out? He comes to defy Israel. The king will make the man who kills him very rich and will give him his daughter. The king will also make the household of that man's father exempt from paying taxes in Israel."
091Sm 17:26 David spoke to the men who were standing with him: "What will be done for the man who kills that Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
091Sm 17:27 The people told him about the offer, concluding, "That is what will be done for the man who kills him."
091Sm 17:28 David's oldest brother Eliab listened as he spoke to the men, and became angry with him. "Why did you come down here?" he asked. "Who did you leave those few sheep with in the wilderness? I know your arrogance and your evil heart-- you came down to see the battle!"
091Sm 17:29 "What have I done now?" protested David. "It was just a question."
091Sm 17:30 Then he turned from those beside him to others in front of him and asked about the offer. The people gave him the same answer as before.
091Sm 17:31 What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, so he had David brought to him.
091Sm 17:32 David said to Saul, "Don't let anyone be discouraged by him; your servant will go and fight this Philistine!"
091Sm 17:33 But Saul replied, "You can't go fight this Philistine. You're just a youth, and he's been a warrior since he was young."
091Sm 17:34 David answered Saul, "Your servant has been tending his father's sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock,
091Sm 17:35 I went after it, struck it down, and rescued [the lamb] from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it.
091Sm 17:36 Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God."
091Sm 17:37 Then David said, "The LORD who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and may the LORD be with you."
091Sm 17:38 Then Saul had his own military clothes put on David. He put a bronze helmet on David's head and had him put on armor.
091Sm 17:39 David strapped his sword on over the military clothes and tried to walk, but he was not used to them. "I can't walk in these," David said to Saul, "I'm not used to them." So David took them off.
091Sm 17:40 Instead, he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in the pouch, in his shepherd's bag. Then, with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine.
091Sm 17:41 The Philistine came closer and closer to David, with the shield-bearer in front of him.
091Sm 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a youth, healthy and handsome.
091Sm 17:43 He said to David, "Am I a dog that you come against me with sticks?" Then he cursed David by his gods.
091Sm 17:44 "Come here," the Philistine called to David, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts!"
091Sm 17:45 David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with a dagger, spear, and sword, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel's armies-- you have defied Him.
091Sm 17:46 Today, the LORD will hand you over to me. Today, I'll strike you down, cut your head off, and give the corpses of the Philistine camp to the birds of the sky and the creatures of the earth. Then all the world will know that Israel has a God,
091Sm 17:47 and this whole assembly will know that it is not by sword or by spear that the LORD saves, for the battle is the LORD's. He will hand you over to us."
091Sm 17:48 When the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly to the battle line to meet the Philistine.
091Sm 17:49 David put his hand in the bag, took out a stone, slung [it], and hit the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
091Sm 17:50 David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone. Even though David had no sword, he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
091Sm 17:51 David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine's sword, pulled it from its sheath, and used it to kill him. Then he cut off his head. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they ran.
091Sm 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah rallied, shouting their battle cry, and chased the Philistines to the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. Philistine bodies were strewn all along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
091Sm 17:53 When the Israelites returned from the pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps.
091Sm 17:54 David took Goliath's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put Goliath's weapons in his [own] tent.
091Sm 17:55 When Saul had seen David going out to confront the Philistine, he asked Abner the commander of the army, "Whose son is this youth, Abner?" "[My] king, as surely as you live, I don't know," Abner replied.
091Sm 17:56 The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is!"
091Sm 17:57 When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head still in his hand.
091Sm 17:58 Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" "The son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem," David answered.
091Sm 18:1 When David had finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan committed himself to David, and loved him as much as he loved himself.
091Sm 18:2 Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him return to his father's house.
091Sm 18:3 Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as much as himself.
091Sm 18:4 Then Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his military tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.
091Sm 18:5 David marched out [with the army], and was successful in everything Saul sent him to do. Saul put him in command of the soldiers, which pleased all the people and Saul's servants as well.
091Sm 18:6 As David was returning from killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul, singing and dancing with tambourines, with shouts of joy, and with three-stringed instruments.
091Sm 18:7 As they celebrated, the women sang: Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands.
091Sm 18:8 Saul was furious and resented this song. "They credited tens of thousands to David," he complained, "but they only credited me with thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom?"
091Sm 18:9 So Saul watched David jealously from that day forward.
091Sm 18:10 The next day an evil spirit from God took control of Saul, and he began to rave inside the palace. David was playing [the harp] as usual, but Saul was holding a spear,
091Sm 18:11 and he threw it, thinking, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David got away from him twice.
091Sm 18:12 Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left from Saul.
091Sm 18:13 Therefore, Saul reassigned David and made him commander over 1,000 men. David led the troops
091Sm 18:14 and continued to be successful in all his activities because the LORD was with him.
091Sm 18:15 When Saul observed that David was very successful, he dreaded him.
091Sm 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David because he was leading their troops.
091Sm 18:17 Saul told David, "Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I'll give her to you as a wife, if you will be a warrior for me and fight the LORD's battles." But Saul was thinking, "My hand doesn't need to be against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him."
091Sm 18:18 Then David responded, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
091Sm 18:19 When it was time to give Saul's daughter Merab to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.
091Sm 18:20 Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David, and when it was reported to Saul, it pleased him.
091Sm 18:21 "I'll give her to him," Saul thought. "She'll be a trap for him, and the hand of the Philistines will be against him." So Saul said to David a second time, "You can now be my son-in-law."
091Sm 18:22 Saul then ordered his servants, "Speak to David in private and tell him, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. Therefore, you should become the king's son-in-law.'"
091Sm 18:23 Saul's servants reported these words directly to David, but he replied, "Is it trivial in your sight to become the king's son-in-law? I am a poor man who is common."
091Sm 18:24 The servants reported back to Saul, "These are the words David spoke."
091Sm 18:25 Then Saul replied, "Say this to David: 'The king desires no other bride-price except 100 Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.' " Actually, Saul intended to cause David's death at the hands of the Philistines.
091Sm 18:26 When the servants reported these terms to David, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. Before the wedding day arrived,
091Sm 18:27 David and his men went out and killed 200 Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as full payment to the king to become his son-in-law. Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David as his wife.
091Sm 18:28 Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved him,
091Sm 18:29 and he became even more afraid of David. As a result, Saul was David's enemy from then on.
091Sm 18:30 Every time the Philistine commanders came out to fight, David was more successful than all of Saul's officers. So his name became very famous.
091Sm 19:1 Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Saul's son Jonathan liked David very much,
091Sm 19:2 so he told him: "My father Saul intends to kill you. Be on your guard in the morning and hide in a secret place and stay there.
091Sm 19:3 I'll go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are and talk to him about you. When I see what [he says], I'll tell you."
091Sm 19:4 Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul. He said to him: "The king should not sin against his servant David. He hasn't sinned against you; in fact, his actions have been a great advantage to you.
091Sm 19:5 He took his life in his hands when he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced, so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?"
091Sm 19:6 Saul listened to Jonathan's advice and swore an oath: "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be killed."
091Sm 19:7 So Jonathan summoned David and told him all these words. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as [he did] before.
091Sm 19:8 When war broke out again, David went out and fought against the Philistines. He defeated them with such a great force that they fled from him.
091Sm 19:9 Now an evil spirit from the LORD came on Saul as he was sitting in his palace holding a spear. David was playing [the harp],
091Sm 19:10 and Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear. As the spear struck the wall, David eluded Saul and escaped. That night he ran away.
091Sm 19:11 Saul sent agents to David's house to watch for him and kill him in the morning. But his wife Michal warned David: "If you don't escape tonight, you will be dead tomorrow!"
091Sm 19:12 So she lowered David from the window, and he fled and escaped.
091Sm 19:13 Then Michal took the household idol and put it on the bed, placed some goats' hair on its head, and covered it with a garment.
091Sm 19:14 When Saul sent agents to seize David, Michal said, "He's sick."
091Sm 19:15 Saul sent the agents [back] to see David and said, "Bring him on his bed so I can kill him."
091Sm 19:16 When the messengers arrived, to their surprise, the household idol was on the bed with some goats' hair on its head.
091Sm 19:17 Saul asked Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this? You sent my enemy away, and he has escaped!" She answered him, "He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I kill you?'"
091Sm 19:18 So David fled and escaped and went to Samuel at Ramah and told him everything Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel left and stayed at Naioth.
091Sm 19:19 When it was reported to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah,
091Sm 19:20 Saul sent agents to seize David. However, when they saw the group of prophets prophesying with Samuel leading them, the Spirit of God came on Saul's agents, and they also started prophesying.
091Sm 19:21 When they reported to Saul, he sent other agents, and they also began prophesying. So Saul tried again and sent a third group of agents, and even they began prophesying.
091Sm 19:22 Then Saul himself went to Ramah. He came to the large cistern at Secu, looked around, and asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "At Naioth in Ramah," someone said.
091Sm 19:23 So he went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God also came on him, and as he walked along, he prophesied until he entered Naioth in Ramah.
091Sm 19:24 Saul then removed his clothes and also prophesied before Samuel; he collapsed [and lay] naked all that day and all that night. That is why they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 20:1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What did I do wrong? How have I sinned against your father so that he wants to take my life?"
091Sm 20:2 Jonathan said to him, "No, you won't die. Listen, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This can't be [true]."
091Sm 20:3 But David said, "Your father certainly knows that you have come to look favorably on me. He has said, 'Jonathan must not know of this, or else he will be grieved.' " David also swore, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death."
091Sm 20:4 Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
091Sm 20:5 So David told him, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I'm supposed to sit down and eat with the king. Instead, let me go, and I'll hide in the field until the third night.
091Sm 20:6 If your father misses me at all, say, 'David urgently requested my permission to quickly go to his town Bethlehem for an annual sacrifice there involving the whole clan.'
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'Good,' then your servant is safe, but if he becomes angry, you will know he has evil intentions.
091Sm 20:8 Deal faithfully with your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant before the LORD with you. If I have done anything wrong, then kill me yourself; why take me to your father?"
091Sm 20:9 "No!" Jonathan responded. "If I ever find out my father has evil intentions against you, wouldn't I tell you about it?"
091Sm 20:10 So David asked Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
091Sm 20:11 He answered David, "Come on, let's go out to the field." So both of them went out to the field.
091Sm 20:12 "By the LORD, the God of Israel, if I sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day and I find out that he is favorable toward you, and if I do not send for you and tell you,
091Sm 20:13 then may God punish Jonathan and do so severely. If my father intends to bring evil on you, then I will tell you, and I will send you away, and you will go in peace. May the LORD be with you, just as He was with my father.
091Sm 20:14 If I continue to live, treat me with the LORD's faithful love, but if I die,
091Sm 20:15 don't ever withdraw your faithful love from my household-- not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."
091Sm 20:16 Then Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD hold David's enemies accountable."
091Sm 20:17 Jonathan once again swore to David in his love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.
091Sm 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the New Moon; you'll be missed because your seat will be empty.
091Sm 20:19 The following day hurry down and go to the place where you hid on the day this incident began and stay beside the rock Ezel.
091Sm 20:20 I will shoot three arrows beside it as if I'm aiming at a target.
091Sm 20:21 Then I will send the young man [and say], 'Go and find the arrows!' Now, if I expressly say to the young man, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you-- get them,' then come, because as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no problem.
091Sm 20:22 But if I say this to the youth: 'Look, the arrows are beyond you!' then go, for the LORD is sending you away.
091Sm 20:23 As for the matter you and I have spoken about, the LORD will be a witness between you and me forever."
091Sm 20:24 So David hid in the field. At the New Moon, the king sat down to eat the meal.
091Sm 20:25 He sat at his usual place on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat facing him and Abner took his place beside Saul, but David's place was empty.
091Sm 20:26 Saul did not say anything that day because he thought, "Something unexpected has happened; he must be ceremonially unclean-- yes, that's it, he is unclean."
091Sm 20:27 However, the day after the New Moon, the second day, David's place was [still] empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, "Why didn't Jesse's son come to the meal either yesterday or today?"
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan answered, "David asked for my permission to go to Bethlehem.
091Sm 20:29 He said, 'Please let me go because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if you are pleased with me, let me go so I can see my brothers.' That's why he didn't come to the king's table."
091Sm 20:30 Then Saul became angry with Jonathan and shouted, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you are siding with Jesse's son to your own shame and to the disgrace of your mother?
091Sm 20:31 Every day Jesse's son lives on earth you and your kingship are not secure. Now send for him and bring him to me-- he deserves to die."
091Sm 20:32 Jonathan answered his father back: "Why is he to be killed? What has he done?"
091Sm 20:33 Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him, so he knew that his father was determined to kill David.
091Sm 20:34 He got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the New Moon, for he was grieved because of his father's shameful behavior toward David.
091Sm 20:35 In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointed meeting with David. A small young man was with him.
091Sm 20:36 He said to the young man, "Run and find the arrows I'm shooting." As the young man ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.
091Sm 20:37 He came to the location of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, but Jonathan called to him and said, "The arrow is beyond you, isn't it?"
091Sm 20:38 Then Jonathan called to him, "Hurry up and don't stop!" Jonathan's young man picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
091Sm 20:39 He did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.
091Sm 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the young man who was with him and said, "Go, take it back to the city."
091Sm 20:41 When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone Ezel, fell with his face to the ground, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept with each other, though David wept more.
091Sm 20:42 Jonathan then said to David, "Go in the assurance the two of us pledged in the name of the LORD when we said: The LORD will be [a witness] between you and me and between my offspring and your offspring forever." Then David left, and Jonathan went into the city.
091Sm 21:1 David went to Ahimelech the priest at Nob. Ahimelech was afraid to meet David, so he said to him, "Why are you alone and no one is with you?"
091Sm 21:2 David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king gave me a mission, but he told me, 'Don't let anyone know anything about the mission I'm sending you on or what I have ordered you [to do].' I have stationed [my] young men at a certain place.
091Sm 21:3 Now what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever can be found."
091Sm 21:4 The priest told him, "There is no ordinary bread on hand. However, there is consecrated bread, but the young men may eat it only if they have kept themselves from women."
091Sm 21:5 David answered him, "I swear that women are being kept from us, as always when I go out [to battle]. The young men's bodies are consecrated even on an ordinary mission, so of course their bodies are consecrated today."
091Sm 21:6 So the priest gave him the consecrated [bread], for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD. When the bread was removed, it had been replaced with warm bread.
091Sm 21:7 One of Saul's servants, detained before the LORD, was there that day. His name was Doeg the Edomite, chief of Saul's shepherds.
091Sm 21:8 David said to Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or sword on hand? I didn't even bring my sword or my weapons since the king's mission was urgent."
091Sm 21:9 The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, then take it, for there isn't another one here." "There's none like it!" David said. "Give it to me."
091Sm 21:10 David fled that day from Saul's presence and went to King Achish of Gath.
091Sm 21:11 But Achish's servants said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Don't they sing about him during their dances: Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands?"
091Sm 21:12 David took this to heart and became very afraid of King Achish of Gath,
091Sm 21:13 so he pretended to be insane in their presence. He acted like a madman around them,scribbling on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
091Sm 21:14 "Look! You can see the man is crazy," Achish said to his servants. "Why did you bring him to me?
091Sm 21:15 Do I have such a shortage of crazy people that you brought this one to act crazy around me? Is this one going to come into my house?"
091Sm 22:1 So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When David's brothers and his father's whole family heard, they went down and joined him there.
091Sm 22:2 In addition, every man who was desperate, in debt, or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About 400 men were with him.
091Sm 22:3 From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab where he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me."
091Sm 22:4 So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold.
091Sm 22:5 Then the prophet Gad said to David, "Don't stay in the stronghold. Leave and return to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
091Sm 22:6 Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree at the high place. His spear was in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
091Sm 22:7 Saul said to his servants, "Listen, men of Benjamin: Is Jesse's son going to give all of you fields and vineyards? [Do you think] he'll make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
091Sm 22:8 That's why all of you have conspired against me! Nobody tells me when my own son makes a covenant with Jesse's son. None of you cares about me or tells me that my son has stirred up my own servant to wait in ambush for me, as [is the case] today."
091Sm 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, answered: "I saw Jesse's son come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
091Sm 22:10 Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
091Sm 22:11 The king sent [messengers] to summon Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub, and his father's whole family, who were priests in Nob. All of them came to the king.
091Sm 22:12 Then Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub!" "I'm at your service, my lord," he said.
091Sm 22:13 Saul asked him, "Why did you and Jesse's son conspire against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him, so he could rise up against me and wait in ambush, as [is the case] today."
091Sm 22:14 Ahimelech replied to the king: "Who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, and honored in your house.
091Sm 22:15 Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Please don't let the king make an accusation against your servant or any of my father's household, for your servant didn't have any idea about all this."
091Sm 22:16 But the king said, "You will die, Ahimelech-- you and your father's whole family!"
091Sm 22:17 Then the king ordered the guards standing by him, "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD because they sided with David. For they knew he was fleeing, but they didn't tell me." But the king's servants would not lift a hand to execute the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:18 So the king said to Doeg, "Go and execute the priests!" So Doeg the Edomite went and executed the priests himself. On that day, he killed 85 men who wore linen ephods.
091Sm 22:19 He also struck down Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword-- both men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.
091Sm 22:20 However, one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.
091Sm 22:21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:22 Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day and that he was sure to report to Saul. I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father's family.
091Sm 22:23 Stay with me. Don't be afraid, for the one who wants to take my life wants to take your life. You will be safe with me."
091Sm 23:1 It was reported to David: "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and raiding the threshing floors."
091Sm 23:2 So David inquired of the LORD: "Should I launch an attack against these Philistines?" The LORD answered David, "Launch an attack against the Philistines and rescue Keilah."
091Sm 23:3 But David's men said to him, "Look, we're afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!"
091Sm 23:4 Once again, David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him: "Go at once to Keilah, for I will hand the Philistines over to you."
091Sm 23:5 Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, drove their livestock away, and inflicted heavy losses on them. So David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.
091Sm 23:6 Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, and he brought an ephod with him.
091Sm 23:7 When it was reported to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, he said, "God has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with barred gates."
091Sm 23:8 Then Saul summoned all the troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.
091Sm 23:9 When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod."
091Sm 23:10 Then David said, "LORD God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me.
091Sm 23:11 Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down as Your servant has heard? LORD God of Israel, please tell Your servant." The LORD answered, "He will come down."
091Sm 23:12 Then David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?" "They will," the LORD responded.
091Sm 23:13 So David and his men, numbering about 600, left Keilah at once and moved from place to place. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he called off the expedition.
091Sm 23:14 David then stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand David over to him.
091Sm 23:15 David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesh when he saw that Saul had come out to take his life.
091Sm 23:16 Then Saul's son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and encouraged him in [his faith in] God,
091Sm 23:17 saying, "Don't be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. You yourself will be king over Israel, and I'll be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows it is true."
091Sm 23:18 Then the two of them made a covenant in the LORD's presence. Afterwards, David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home.
091Sm 23:19 Some Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "David is hiding among us in the strongholds in Horesh on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon.
091Sm 23:20 Now, whenever the king wants to come down, let him come down. Our part will be to hand him over to the king."
091Sm 23:21 "May you be blessed by the LORD," replied Saul, "for you have taken pity on me.
091Sm 23:22 Go and check again. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there; they tell me he is extremely cunning.
091Sm 23:23 Look and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with accurate information, and I'll go with you. If it turns out he really is in the region, I'll search for him among all the clans of Judah."
091Sm 23:24 So they went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness near Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon,
091Sm 23:25 and Saul and his men went to look for [him]. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. Saul heard of this and pursued David there.
091Sm 23:26 Saul went along one side of the mountain and David and his men went along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away from Saul, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
091Sm 23:27 Then a messenger came to Saul saying, "Come quickly, because the Philistines have raided the land!"
091Sm 23:28 So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to engage the Philistines. Therefore, that place was named the Rock of Separation.
091Sm 23:29  From there David went up and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.
091Sm 24:1 When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the wilderness near En-gedi."
091Sm 24:2 So Saul took 3,000 of Israel's choice men and went to look for David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
091Sm 24:3 When Saul came to the sheep pens along the road, a cave was there, and he went in to relieve himself. David and his men were staying in the back of the cave,
091Sm 24:4 so they said to him, "Look, this is the day the LORD told you about: 'I will hand your enemy over to you so you can do to him whatever you desire.'" Then David got up and secretly cut off the corner of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:5 Afterwards, David's conscience bothered him because he had cut off the corner of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:6 He said to his men, "I swear before the LORD: I would never do such a thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed. [I will never] lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD's anointed."
091Sm 24:7 With these words David persuaded his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.
091Sm 24:8 After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed to the ground in homage.
091Sm 24:9 David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of people who say, 'Look, David intends to harm you'?
091Sm 24:10 You can see with your own eyes that the LORD handed you over to me today in the cave. [Someone] advised [me] to kill you, but I took pity on you and said: I won't lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD's anointed.
091Sm 24:11 See, my father! Look at the corner of your robe in my hand, for I cut it off, but I didn't kill you. Look and recognize that there is no evil or rebellion in me. I haven't sinned against you even though you are hunting me down to take my life.
091Sm 24:12 "May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will never be against you.
091Sm 24:13 As the old proverb says, 'Wickedness comes from wicked people.' My hand will never be against you.
091Sm 24:14 Who has the king of Israel come after? What are you chasing after? A dead dog? A flea?
091Sm 24:15 May the LORD be judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from you."
091Sm 24:16 When David finished saying these things to him, Saul replied, "Is that your voice, David my son?" Then Saul wept aloud
091Sm 24:17 and said to David, "You are more righteous than I, for you have done what is good to me though I have done what is evil to you.
091Sm 24:18 You yourself have told me today what good you did for me: when the LORD handed me over to you, you didn't kill me.
091Sm 24:19 When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go unharmed?May the LORD repay you with good for what you've done for me today.
091Sm 24:20 "Now I know for certain you will be king, and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
091Sm 24:21 Therefore swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."
091Sm 24:22 So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.
091Sm 25:1 Samuel died, and all Israel assembled to mourn for him, and they buried him by his home in Ramah. David then went down to the Wilderness of Paran.
091Sm 25:2 A man in Maon had a business in Carmel; he was a very rich man with 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats and was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
091Sm 25:3 The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name, Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, but the man, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in [his] dealings.
091Sm 25:4 While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep,
091Sm 25:5 so David sent 10 young men instructing them, "Go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, greet him in my name.
091Sm 25:6 Then say this: 'Long life to you, and peace to you, to your family, and to all that is yours.
091Sm 25:7 I hear that you are shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them, and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel.
091Sm 25:8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let [my] young men find favor with you, for we have come on a feast day. Please give whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.'"
091Sm 25:9 David's young men went and said all these things to Nabal on David's behalf, and they waited.
091Sm 25:10 Nabal asked them, "Who is David? Who is Jesse's son? Many slaves these days are running away from their masters.
091Sm 25:11 Am I supposed to take my bread, my water, and my meat that I butchered for my shearers and give them to men who are from I don't know where?"
091Sm 25:12 David's men retraced their steps. When they returned to him, they reported all these words.
091Sm 25:13 He said to his men, "All of you, put on your swords!" So David and all his men put on their swords. About 400 men followed David while 200 stayed with the supplies.
091Sm 25:14 One of Nabal's young men informed Abigail, Nabal's wife: "Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he yelled at them.
091Sm 25:15 The men treated us well. When we were in the field, we weren't harassed and nothing of ours was missing the whole time we were living among them.
091Sm 25:16 They were a wall around us, both day and night, the entire time we were herding the sheep.
091Sm 25:17 Now consider carefully what you must do, because there is certain to be trouble for our master and his entire family. He is such a worthless fool nobody can talk to him!"
091Sm 25:18 Abigail hurried, taking 200 loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, a bushel of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.
091Sm 25:19 Then she said to her male servants, "Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
091Sm 25:20 As she rode the donkey down a mountain pass hidden from view, she saw David and his men coming toward her and met them.
091Sm 25:21 David had just said, "I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the wilderness for nothing. He was not missing anything, yet he paid me back evil for good.
091Sm 25:22 May God punish me, and even more if I let any of his men [survive] until morning."
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey and fell with her face to the ground in front of David.
091Sm 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, "The guilt is mine, my lord, but please let your servant speak to you directly. Listen to the words of your servant.
091Sm 25:25 My lord should pay no attention to this worthless man Nabal, for he lives up to his name: His name is Nabal, and stupidity is all he knows. I, your servant, didn't see my lord's young men whom you sent.
091Sm 25:26 Now my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, it is the LORD who kept you from participating in bloodshed and avenging yourself by your own hand. May your enemies and those who want trouble for my lord be like Nabal.
091Sm 25:27 Accept this gift your servant has brought to my lord, and let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD is certain to make a lasting dynasty for my lord because he fights the LORD's battles. Throughout your life, may evil not be found in you.
091Sm 25:29 "When someone pursues you and attempts to take your life, my lord's life will be tucked safely in the place where the LORD your God protects the living. However, He will fling away your enemies' lives like [stones] from a sling.
091Sm 25:30 When the LORD does for my lord all the good He promised and appoints you ruler over Israel,
091Sm 25:31 there will not be remorse or a troubled conscience for my lord because of needless bloodshed or my lord's revenge. And when the LORD does good things for my lord, may you remember [me] your servant."
091Sm 25:32 Then David said to Abigail, "Praise to the LORD God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today!
091Sm 25:33 Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you. Today you kept me from participating in bloodshed and avenging myself by my own hand.
091Sm 25:34 Otherwise, as surely as the LORD God of Israel lives, who prevented me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, Nabal wouldn't have had any men left by morning light."
091Sm 25:35 Then David accepted what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. See, I have heard what you said and have granted your request."
091Sm 25:36 Then Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was in his house, feasting like a king. Nabal was in a good mood and very drunk, so she didn't say anything to him until morning light.
091Sm 25:37 In the morning when Nabal sobered up, his wife told him about these events. Then he had a seizure and became paralyzed.
091Sm 25:38 About 10 days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead.
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise the LORD who championed my cause against Nabal's insults and restrained His servant from doing evil. The LORD brought Nabal's evil deeds back on his own head." Then David sent messengers to speak to Abigail about marrying him.
091Sm 25:40 When David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, "David sent us to bring you to him as a wife."
091Sm 25:41 She bowed her face to the ground and said, "Here I am, your servant, to wash the feet of my lord's servants."
091Sm 25:42 Then Abigail got up quickly, and with her five female servants accompanying her, rode on the donkey following David's messengers. And so she became his wife.
091Sm 25:43 David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and the two of them became his wives.
091Sm 25:44 But Saul gave his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
091Sm 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying, "David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon."
091Sm 26:2 So Saul, accompanied by 3,000 of the choice men of Israel, went to the Wilderness of Ziph to search for David there.
091Sm 26:3 Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon. David was living in the wilderness and discovered Saul had come there after him.
091Sm 26:4 So David sent out spies and knew for certain that Saul had come.
091Sm 26:5 Immediately, David went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp with the troops camped around him.
091Sm 26:6 Then David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, "Who will go with me into the camp to Saul?" "I'll go with you," answered Abishai.
091Sm 26:7 That night, David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the troops were lying around him.
091Sm 26:8 Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has handed your enemy over to you. Let me thrust the spear through him into the ground just once. I won't [have to strike] him twice!"
091Sm 26:9 But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the LORD's anointed and be blameless?"
091Sm 26:10 David added, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will certainly strike him down: either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
091Sm 26:11 However, because of the LORD, I will never lift my hand against the LORD's anointed. Instead, take the spear and the water jug by his head, and let's go."
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and the water jug by Saul's head, and they went their way. No one saw them, no one knew, and no one woke up; they all remained asleep because a deep sleep from the LORD came over them.
091Sm 26:13 David crossed to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance; there was a considerable space between them.
091Sm 26:14 Then David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner: "Aren't you going to answer, Abner?" "Who are you who calls to the king?" Abner asked.
091Sm 26:15 David called to Abner, "You're a man, aren't you? Who in Israel is your equal? So why didn't you protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him?
091Sm 26:16 What you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, all of you deserve to die since you didn't protect your lord, the LORD's anointed. Now look around; where are the king's spear and water jug that were by his head?"
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and asked, "Is that your voice, my son David?" "It is my voice, my lord and king," David said.
091Sm 26:18 Then he continued, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?
091Sm 26:19 Now, may my lord the king please hear the words of his servant: If it is the LORD who has incited you against me, then may He accept an offering. But if it is people, may they be cursed in the presence of the LORD, for today they have driven me away from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD saying, 'Go and worship other gods.'
091Sm 26:20 So don't let my blood fall to the ground far from the LORD's presence, for the king of Israel has come out to search for a flea, like one who pursues a partridge in the mountains."
091Sm 26:21 Saul responded, "I have sinned. Come back, my son David, I will never harm you again because today you considered my life precious. I have been a fool! I've committed a grave error."
091Sm 26:22 David answered, "Here is the king's spear; have one of the young men come over and get it.
091Sm 26:23 May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and his loyalty. I wasn't willing to lift my hand against the LORD's anointed, even though the LORD handed you over to me today.
091Sm 26:24 Just as I considered your life valuable today, so may the LORD consider my life valuable and rescue me from all trouble."
091Sm 26:25 Saul said to him, "You are blessed, my son David. You will certainly do great things and will also prevail." Then David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
091Sm 27:1 David said to himself, "One of these days I'll be swept away by Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape immediately to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will stop searching for me everywhere in Israel, and I'll escape from him."
091Sm 27:2 So David set out with his 600 men and went to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
091Sm 27:3 David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
091Sm 27:4 When it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
091Sm 27:5 Now David said to Achish, "If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
091Sm 27:6 That day Achish gave Ziklag to him, and it still belongs to the kings of Judah today.
091Sm 27:7 The time that David stayed in the Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months.
091Sm 27:8 David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. From ancient times they had been the inhabitants of the region through Shur as far as the land of Egypt.
091Sm 27:9 Whenever David attacked the land, he did not leave a single person alive, either man or woman, but he took flocks, herds, donkeys, camels, and clothing. Then he came back to Achish,
091Sm 27:10 who inquired, "Where did you raid today?" David replied, "The south country of Judah," "The south country of the Jerahmeelites," or "Against the south country of the Kenites."
091Sm 27:11 David did not let a man or woman live to be brought to Gath, for he said, "Or they will inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.' " This was David's custom during the whole time he stayed in the Philistine territory.
091Sm 27:12 So Achish trusted David, thinking, "Since he has made himself detestable to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever."
091Sm 28:1 At that time, the Philistines brought their military units together into one army to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, "You know, of course, that you and your men must march out in the army with me."
091Sm 28:2 David replied to Achish, "Good, you will find out what your servant can do." So Achish said to David, "Very well, I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard."
091Sm 28:3 By this time Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his city, and Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.
091Sm 28:4 The Philistines came together and camped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at Gilboa.
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and trembled violently.
091Sm 28:6 He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him in dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.
091Sm 28:7 Saul then said to his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her." His servants replied, "There is a woman at Endor who is a medium."
091Sm 28:8 Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes and set out with two of his men. They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, "Consult a spirit for me. Bring up for me the one I tell you."
091Sm 28:9 But the woman said to him, "You surely know what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land. Why are you setting a trap for me to get me killed?"
091Sm 28:10 Then Saul swore to her by the LORD: "As surely as the LORD lives, nothing bad will happen to you because of this."
091Sm 28:11 "Who is it that you want me to bring up for you?" the woman asked. "Bring up Samuel for me," he answered.
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, and then she asked Saul, "Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!"
091Sm 28:13 But the king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" "I see a spirit form coming up out of the earth," the woman answered.
091Sm 28:14 Then Saul asked her, "What does he look like?" "An old man is coming up," she replied. "He's wearing a robe." Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed his face to the ground and paid homage.
091Sm 28:15 "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" Samuel asked Saul. "I'm in serious trouble," replied Saul. "The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me. He doesn't answer me any more, either through the prophets or in dreams. So I've called on you to tell me what I should do."
091Sm 28:16 Samuel answered, "Since the LORD has turned away from you and has become your enemy, why are you asking me?
091Sm 28:17 The LORD has done exactly what He said through me: The LORD has torn the kingship out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David.
091Sm 28:18 You did not obey the LORD and did not carry out His wrath against Amalek; therefore the LORD has done this to you today.
091Sm 28:19 The LORD will also hand Israel over to the Philistines along with you. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and the LORD will hand Israel's army over to the Philistines."
091Sm 28:20 Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was terrified by Samuel's words and was also weak because he hadn't had any food all day and all night.
091Sm 28:21 The woman came over to Saul, and she saw that he was terrified and said to him, "Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me [to do].
091Sm 28:22 Now please listen to your servant. Let me set some food in front of you. Eat and it will give you strength so you can go on your way."
091Sm 28:23 He refused, saying, "I won't eat," but when his servants and the woman urged him, he listened to them. He got up off the ground and sat on the bed.
091Sm 28:24 The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
091Sm 28:25 She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Afterwards, they got up and left that night.
091Sm 29:1 The Philistines brought all their military units together at Aphek while Israel was camped by the spring in Jezreel.
091Sm 29:2 As the Philistine leaders were passing [in review with their units of] hundreds and thousands, David and his men were passing [in review] behind them with Achish.
091Sm 29:3 Then the Philistine commanders asked, "What are these Hebrews [doing here]?" Achish answered the Philistine commanders, "That is David, servant of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me a considerable period of time. From the day he defected until today, I've found no fault with him."
091Sm 29:4 The Philistine commanders, however, were enraged with Achish and told him, "Send that man back and let him return to the place you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle only to become our adversary during the battle. What better way could he regain his master's favor than with the heads of our men?
091Sm 29:5 Isn't this the David they sing about during their dances: Saul has killed his thousands, but David his tens of thousands?"
091Sm 29:6 So Achish summoned David and told him, "As the LORD lives, you are an honorable man. I think it is good to have you working with me in the camp, because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until today. But the leaders don't think you are reliable.
091Sm 29:7 Now go back quietly and you won't be doing [anything] the Philistine leaders think is wrong."
091Sm 29:8 "But what have I done?" David replied to Achish. "From the first day I was with you until today, what have you found against your servant to keep me from going along to fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
091Sm 29:9 Achish answered David, "I'm convinced that you are as reliable as an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders have said, 'He must not go into battle with us.'
091Sm 29:10 So get up early in the morning, you and your masters' servants who came with you. When you've all gotten up early, go as soon as it's light."
091Sm 29:11 So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
091Sm 30:1 David and his men arrived in Ziklag on the third day. The Amalekites had raided the Negev and attacked and burned down Ziklag.
091Sm 30:2 They also had kidnapped the women and everyone in it from the youngest to the oldest. They had killed no one but had carried them off as they went on their way.
091Sm 30:3 When David and his men arrived at the town, they found it burned down. Their wives, sons, and daughters had been kidnapped.
091Sm 30:4 David and the troops with him wept loudly until they had no strength left to weep.
091Sm 30:5 David's two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had also been kidnapped.
091Sm 30:6 David was in a difficult position because the troops talked about stoning him, for they were all very bitter over [the loss of] their sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
091Sm 30:7 David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought it to him,
091Sm 30:8 and David asked the LORD: "Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them?" The LORD replied to him, "Pursue [them], for you will certainly overtake [them] and rescue [the people]."
091Sm 30:9 David and the 600 men with him went as far as the Wadi Besor, where 200 who were to remain behind would stop.
091Sm 30:10 They stopped because they were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor. David and 400 of the men continued in pursuit.
091Sm 30:11 They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink.
091Sm 30:12 Then they gave him some pressed figs and two clusters of raisins. After he ate he revived, for he hadn't eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights.
091Sm 30:13 Then David said to him, "Who do you belong to? Where are you from?" "I'm an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite man," he said. "My master abandoned me when I got sick three days ago.
091Sm 30:14 We raided the south country of the Cherethites, [the territory] of Judah, and the south country of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag."
091Sm 30:15 David then asked him, "Will you lead me to these raiders?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you won't kill me or turn me over to my master, and I will lead you to them."
091Sm 30:16 So he led him, and there were the Amalekites, spread out over the entire area, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah.
091Sm 30:17 David slaughtered them from twilight until the evening of the next day. None of them escaped, except 400 young men who got on camels and fled.
091Sm 30:18 David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken; he also rescued his two wives.
091Sm 30:19 Nothing [of theirs] was missing from the youngest to the oldest, including the sons and daughters, of all the plunder the Amalekites had taken. David got everything back.
091Sm 30:20 He took all the sheep and cattle, which were driven ahead of the other livestock, and the people shouted, "This is David's plunder!"
091Sm 30:21 When David came to the 200 men who had been too exhausted to go with him and had been left at the Wadi Besor, they came out to meet him and to meet the troops with him. When David approached the men, he greeted them,
091Sm 30:22 but all the worthless men among those who had gone with David retorted, "Because they didn't go with us, we will not give any of the plunder we recovered to them except for each man's wife and children. They may take them and go."
091Sm 30:23 But David said, "My brothers, you must not do this with what the LORD has given us. He protected us and handed over to us the raiders who came against us.
091Sm 30:24 Who can agree to your proposal? The share of the one who goes into battle is to be the same as the share of the one who remains with the supplies. They will share equally."
091Sm 30:25 And it has been so from that day forward. David established [this policy] as a law and an ordinance for Israel [and it continues] to this very day.
091Sm 30:26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD's enemies."
091Sm 30:27 [He sent gifts] to those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negev, and in Jattir;
091Sm 30:28 to those in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and in Eshtemoa;
091Sm 30:29 to those in Racal, in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, and in the towns of the Kenites;
091Sm 30:30 to those in Hormah, in Bor-ashan, and in Athach;
091Sm 30:31 to those in Hebron, and to [those in] all the places where David and his men had roamed.
091Sm 31:1 The Philistines fought against Israel, and Israel's men fled from them. Many were killed on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons and killed his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
091Sm 31:3 When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers caught up with him and severely wounded him.
091Sm 31:4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through and torture me." But his armor-bearer would not do it because he was terrified. Then Saul took his sword and fell on it.
091Sm 31:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him.
091Sm 31:6 So on that day, Saul died together with his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men.
091Sm 31:7 When the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and on the other side of the Jordan saw that Israel's men had run away and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. So the Philistines came and settled in them.
091Sm 31:8 The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:9 They cut off Saul's head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the good news in the temples of their idols and among the people.
091Sm 31:10 Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan.
091Sm 31:11 When the residents of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
091Sm 31:12 all their brave men set out, journeyed all night, and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. When they arrived at Jabesh, they burned the bodies there.
091Sm 31:13 Afterwards, they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and fasted seven days.

102Sm 1:1 After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed at Ziklag two days.
102Sm 1:2 On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head came from Saul's camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage.
102Sm 1:3 David asked him, "Where have you come from?" He replied to him, "I've escaped from the Israelite camp."
102Sm 1:4 "What was the outcome? Tell me," David asked him. "The troops fled from the battle," he answered. "Many of the troops have fallen and are dead. Also, Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
102Sm 1:5 David asked the young man who had brought him the report, "How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
102Sm 1:6 "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," he replied, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear. At that very moment the chariots and the cavalry were closing in on him.
102Sm 1:7 When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, so I answered: I'm at your service.
102Sm 1:8 He asked me, 'Who are you?' I told him: I'm an Amalekite.
102Sm 1:9 Then he begged me, 'Stand over me and kill me, for I'm mortally wounded, but my life still lingers.'
102Sm 1:10 So I stood over him and killed him because I knew that after he had fallen he couldn't survive. I took the crown that was on his head and the armband that was on his arm, and I've brought them here to my lord."
102Sm 1:11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and all the men with him did the same.
102Sm 1:12 They mourned, wept, and fasted until the evening for those who died by the sword-- for Saul, his son Jonathan, the LORD's people, and the house of Israel.
102Sm 1:13 David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I'm the son of a foreigner" he said. "I'm an Amalekite."
102Sm 1:14 David questioned him, "How is it that you were not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"
102Sm 1:15 Then David summoned one of his servants and said, "Come here and kill him!" The servant struck him, and he died.
102Sm 1:16 For David had said to the Amalekite, "Your blood is on your own head because your own mouth testified against you by saying, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'"
102Sm 1:17 David sang the following lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,
102Sm 1:18 and he ordered that the Judahites be taught [The Song of] the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar:
102Sm 1:19 The splendor of Israel lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
102Sm 1:20 Do not tell it in Gath, don't announce it in the streets of Ashkelon, or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, and the daughters of the uncircumcised will gloat.
102Sm 1:21 Mountains of Gilboa, let no dew or rain be on you, or fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was defiled-- the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.
102Sm 1:22 Jonathan's bow never retreated, Saul's sword never returned unstained, from the blood of the slain, from the bodies of the mighty.
102Sm 1:23 Saul and Jonathan, loved and delightful, they were not parted in life or in death. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
102Sm 1:24 Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with luxurious things, who decked your garments with gold ornaments.
102Sm 1:25 How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle! Jonathan [lies] slain on your heights.
102Sm 1:26 I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother. You were such a friend to me. Your love for me was more wonderful than the love of a woman [for me].
102Sm 1:27 How the mighty have fallen and the weapons of war have perished!
102Sm 2:1 Some time later, David inquired of the LORD: "Should I go to one of the towns of Judah?" The LORD answered him, "Go." Then David asked, "Where should I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD replied.
102Sm 2:2 So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.
102Sm 2:3 In addition, David brought the men who were with him, each one with his household, and they settled in the towns near Hebron.
102Sm 2:4 Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David: "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul."
102Sm 2:5 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, "The LORD bless you, because you have shown this special kindness to Saul your lord when you buried him.
102Sm 2:6 Now, may the LORD show special kindness and faithfulness to you, and I will also show the same goodness to you because you have done this deed.
102Sm 2:7 Therefore, be strong and courageous, for though Saul your lord is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
102Sm 2:8 Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Saul's son Ish-boshethand moved him to Mahanaim.
102Sm 2:9 He made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin-- over all Israel.
102Sm 2:10 Saul's son Ish-bosheth was 40 years old when he began his reign over Israel; he ruled for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.
102Sm 2:11 The length of time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
102Sm 2:12 Abner son of Ner and soldiers of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
102Sm 2:13 So Joab son of Zeruiah and David's soldiers marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. The two groups took up positions on opposite sides of the pool.
102Sm 2:14 Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have the young men get up and compete in front of us." "Let them get up," Joab replied.
102Sm 2:15 So they got up and were counted off-- 12 for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and 12 from David's soldiers.
102Sm 2:16 Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and [thrust] his sword into his opponent's side so that they all died together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is named Field of Blades.
102Sm 2:17 The battle that day was extremely fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's soldiers.
102Sm 2:18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was a fast runner, like one of the wild gazelles.
102Sm 2:19 He chased Abner and did not turn to the right or the left in his pursuit of him.
102Sm 2:20 Abner glanced back and said, "Is that you, Asahel?" "Yes it is," Asahel replied.
102Sm 2:21 Abner said to him, "Turn to your right or left, seize one of the young soldiers, and take whatever you can get from him." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
102Sm 2:22 Once again, Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I ever look your brother Joab in the face?"
102Sm 2:23 But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner hit him in the stomach with the end of his spear. The spear went through his body, and he fell and died right there. When all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, they stopped,
102Sm 2:24 but Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
102Sm 2:25 The Benjaminites rallied to Abner; they formed a single unit and took their stand on top of a hill.
102Sm 2:26 Then Abner called out to Joab: "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?"
102Sm 2:27 "As God lives," Joab replied, "if you had not spoken up, the troops wouldn't have stopped pursuing their brothers until morning."
102Sm 2:28 Then Joab blew the ram's horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight.
102Sm 2:29 So Abner and his men marched through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning, and arrived at Mahanaim.
102Sm 2:30 When Joab had turned back from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the troops. In addition to Asahel, 19 of David's soldiers were missing,
102Sm 2:31 but they had killed 360 of the Benjaminites and Abner's men.
102Sm 2:32 Afterwards, they carried Asahel to his father's tomb in Bethlehem and buried him. Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at dawn.
102Sm 3:1 The war between the house of Saul and the house of David was long and drawn out, with David growing stronger and the house of Saul becoming weaker.
102Sm 3:2 Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelite;
102Sm 3:3 his second was Chileab, by Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom, son of Maacah the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
102Sm 3:4 the fourth was Adonijah, son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah, son of Abital;
102Sm 3:5 the sixth was Ithream, by David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
102Sm 3:6 During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner kept acquiring more power in the house of Saul.
102Sm 3:7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah daughter of Aiah, and Ish-bosheth questioned Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"
102Sm 3:8 Abner was very angry about Ish-bosheth's accusation. "Am I a dog's head who belongs to Judah?" he asked. "All this time I've been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends and haven't handed you over to David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!
102Sm 3:9 May God punish Abner and do so severely if I don't do for David what the LORD swore to him:
102Sm 3:10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beer-sheba."
102Sm 3:11 Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner because he was afraid of him.
102Sm 3:12 Abner sent messengers as his representatives to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make your covenant with me, and you can be certain I am on your side to hand all Israel over to you."
102Sm 3:13 David replied, "Good, I will make a covenant with you. However, there's one thing I require of you: Do not appear before me unless you bring Saul's daughter Michal here when you come to see me."
102Sm 3:14 Then David sent messengers to say to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, "Give me back my wife, Michal. I was engaged to her for the price of 100 Philistine foreskins."
102Sm 3:15 So Ish-bosheth sent someone to take her away from her husband, Paltiel son of Laish.
102Sm 3:16 Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Abner said to him, "Go back." So he went back.
102Sm 3:17 Abner conferred with the elders of Israel: "In the past you wanted David to be king over you.
102Sm 3:18 Now take action, because the LORD has spoken concerning David: 'Through My servant David I will save My people Israel from the power of the Philistines and the power of all Israel's enemies.'"
102Sm 3:19 Abner also informed the Benjaminites and went to Hebron to inform David about all that was agreed on by Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
102Sm 3:20 When Abner and 20 men came to David at Hebron, David held a banquet for him and his men.
102Sm 3:21 Abner said to David, "Let me now go and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you, and you will rule over all you desire." So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace.
102Sm 3:22 Just then David's soldiers and Joab returned from a raid and brought a large amount of plundered goods with them. Abner was not with David in Hebron because David had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace.
102Sm 3:23 When Joab and all his army arrived, Joab was informed, "Abner son of Ner came to see the king, the king dismissed him, and he went in peace."
102Sm 3:24 Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look here, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now he's getting away.
102Sm 3:25 You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to find out about your activities and everything you're doing."
102Sm 3:26 Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David was unaware of it.
102Sm 3:27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside to the middle of the gateway, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died in revenge for the death of Asahel, Joab's brother.
102Sm 3:28 David heard [about it] later and said: "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
102Sm 3:29 May it hang over Joab's head and his father's whole house, and may the house of Joab never be without someone who has an infection or leprosy or a man who can only work a spindle or someone who falls by the sword or starves."
102Sm 3:30 Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
102Sm 3:31 David then ordered Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn over Abner." And King David walked behind the funeral procession.
102Sm 3:32 When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept,
102Sm 3:33 and the king sang a lament for Abner: Should Abner die as a fool dies?
102Sm 3:34 Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze [shackles]. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. And all the people wept over him even more.
102Sm 3:35 Then they came to urge David to eat bread while it was still day, but David took an oath: "May God punish me and do so severely if I taste bread or anything else before sunset!"
102Sm 3:36 All the people took note of this, and it pleased them. In fact, everything the king did pleased them.
102Sm 3:37 On that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner.
102Sm 3:38 Then the king said to his soldiers, "You must know that a great leader has fallen in Israel today.
102Sm 3:39 As for me, even though I am the anointed king, I have little power today. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!"
102Sm 4:1 When Saul's son [Ish-bosheth] heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
102Sm 4:2 Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties: one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the Benjaminites. Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,
102Sm 4:3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and still live there as aliens to this very day.
102Sm 4:4 Saul's son Jonathan had a son whose feet were crippled. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was hurrying to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
102Sm 4:5 Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at Ish-bosheth's house during the heat of the day while the king was taking his midday nap.
102Sm 4:6 They entered the interior of the house as if to get wheat and stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.
102Sm 4:7 They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom and stabbed and killed him. Then they beheaded him, took his head, and traveled by way of the Arabah all night.
102Sm 4:8 They brought Ish-bosheth's head to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here's the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who intended to take your life. Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."
102Sm 4:9 But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, [the One] who has redeemed my life from every distress,
102Sm 4:10 when the person told me, 'Look, Saul is dead,' he thought he was a bearer of good news, but I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was my reward to him for his news!
102Sm 4:11 How much more when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house on his own bed! So now, should I not require his blood from your hands and wipe you off the earth?"
102Sm 4:12 So David gave orders to the young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung [their bodies] by the pool in Hebron, but they took Ish-bosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron.
102Sm 5:1 All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
102Sm 5:2 Even while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led us out [to battle] and brought us back. The LORD also said to you, 'You will shepherd My people Israel and be ruler over Israel.'"
102Sm 5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. King David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the LORD's presence, and they anointed David king over Israel.
102Sm 5:4 David was 30 years old when he began his reign; he reigned 40 years.
102Sm 5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned 33 years over all Israel and Judah.
102Sm 5:6 The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites had said to David: "You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you," thinking, "David can't get in here."
102Sm 5:7 Yet David did capture the stronghold of Zion, the city of David.
102Sm 5:8 He said that day, "Whoever attacks the Jebusites must go through the water shaft to reach the lame and the blind who are despised by David." For this reason it is said, "The blind and the lame will never enter the house."
102Sm 5:9 David took up residence in the stronghold, which he named the city of David. He built it up all the way around from the supporting terraces inward.
102Sm 5:10 David became more and more powerful, and the LORD God of Hosts was with him.
102Sm 5:11 King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David; [he also sent] cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
102Sm 5:12 Then David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
102Sm 5:13 After he arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
102Sm 5:14 These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
102Sm 5:17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of David, but he heard about it and went down to the stronghold.
102Sm 5:18 So the Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:19 Then David inquired of the LORD: "Should I go to war against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD replied to David, "Go, for I will certainly hand the Philistines over to you."
102Sm 5:20 So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated them there and said, "Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me." Therefore, he named that place the Lord Bursts Out.
102Sm 5:21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.
102Sm 5:22 The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:23 So David inquired of the Lord, and He answered, "Do not make a frontal assault. Circle around behind them and attack them opposite the balsam trees.
102Sm 5:24 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, act decisively, for then the LORD will have marched out ahead of you to attack the camp of the Philistines."
102Sm 5:25 So David did exactly as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer.
102Sm 6:1 David again assembled all the choice men in Israel, 30,000.
102Sm 6:2 He and all his troops set out to bring the ark of God from Baale-judah.The ark is called by the Name, the name of the LORD of Hosts who dwells [between] the cherubim.
102Sm 6:3 They set the ark of God on a new cart and transported it from Abinadab's house, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart
102Sm 6:4 and brought it with the ark of God from Abinadab's house on the hill. Ahio walked in front of the ark.
102Sm 6:5 David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all [kinds of] fir wood [instruments], lyres, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
102Sm 6:6 When they came to Nacon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen had stumbled.
102Sm 6:7 Then the LORD's anger burned against Uzzah, and God struck him dead on the spot for his irreverence, and he died there next to the ark of God.
102Sm 6:8 David was angry because of the LORD's outburst against Uzzah, so he named that place an Outburst Against Uzzah, as it is today.
102Sm 6:9 David feared the LORD that day and said, "How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?"
102Sm 6:10 So he was not willing to move the ark of the LORD to the city of David; instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
102Sm 6:11 The ark of the LORD remained in his house three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and his whole family.
102Sm 6:12 It was reported to King David: "The LORD has blessed Obed-edom's family and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God." So David went and had the ark of God brought up from Obed-edom's house to the city of David with rejoicing.
102Sm 6:13 When those carrying the ark of the LORD advanced six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
102Sm 6:14 David was dancing with all his might before the LORD wearing a linen ephod.
102Sm 6:15 He and the whole house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of the ram's horn.
102Sm 6:16 As the ark of the LORD was entering the city of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked down from the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.
102Sm 6:17 They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent David had set up for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the LORD's presence.
102Sm 6:18 When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts.
102Sm 6:19 Then he distributed a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake to each one of the whole multitude of the people of Israel, both men and women. Then all the people left, each to his own home.
102Sm 6:20 When David returned [home] to bless his household, Saul's daughter Michal came out to meet him. "How the king of Israel honored himself today!" she said. "He exposed himself today in the sight of the slave girls of his subjects like a vulgar person would expose himself."
102Sm 6:21 David replied to Michal, "I was dancing before the LORD who chose me over your father and his whole family to appoint me ruler over the LORD's people Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD,
102Sm 6:22 and I will humble myself even more and humiliate myself.I will be honored by the slave girls you spoke about."
102Sm 6:23 And Saul's daughter Michal had no child to the day of her death.
102Sm 7:1 When the king had settled into his palace and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,
102Sm 7:2 the king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look, I am living in a cedar house while the ark of God sits inside tent curtains."
102Sm 7:3 So Nathan told the king, "Go and do all that is on your heart, for the LORD is with you."
102Sm 7:4 But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan:
102Sm 7:5 "Go to My servant David and say, 'This is what the LORD says: Are you to build a house for Me to live in?
102Sm 7:6 From the time I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until today I have not lived in a house; instead, I have been moving around with the tabernacle tent.
102Sm 7:7 In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked anyone among the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel: Why haven't you built Me a house of cedar?'
102Sm 7:8 "Now this is what you are to say to My servant David: 'This is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture and from following the sheep to be ruler over My people Israel.
102Sm 7:9 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a name for you like that of the greatest in the land.
102Sm 7:10 I will establish a place for My people Israel and plant them, so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not afflict them as they have done
102Sm 7:11 ever since the day I ordered judges to be over My people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. " 'The LORD declares to you: The LORD Himself will make a house for you.
102Sm 7:12 When your time comes and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
102Sm 7:13 He will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
102Sm 7:14 I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with a human rod and with blows from others.
102Sm 7:15 But My faithful love will never leave him as I removed it from Saul; I removed him from your way.
102Sm 7:16 Your house and kingdom will endure before Me forever, and your throne will be established forever.'"
102Sm 7:17 Nathan spoke all these words and this entire vision to David.
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went in, sat in the LORD's presence, and said, "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?
102Sm 7:19 What You have done so far was a little thing to You, Lord God, for You have also spoken about Your servant's house in the distant future. And this is a revelation for mankind, Lord God.
102Sm 7:20 What more can David say to You? You know Your servant, Lord God.
102Sm 7:21 Because of Your word and according to Your will, You have revealed all these great things to Your servant.
102Sm 7:22 "This is why You are great, Lord God. There is no one like You, and there is no God besides You, as all we have heard confirms.
102Sm 7:23 And who is like Your people Israel? God came to one nation on earth in order to redeem a people for Himself, to make a name for Himself, and to perform for them great and awesome acts, driving out nations and their gods before Your people You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt.
102Sm 7:24 You established Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, LORD, have become their God.
102Sm 7:25 "Now, LORD God, fulfill the promise forever that You have made to Your servant and his house. Do as You have promised,
102Sm 7:26 so that Your name will be exalted forever, when it is said, 'The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.' The house of Your servant David will be established before You
102Sm 7:27 since You, LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant when You said, 'I will build a house for you.' Therefore, Your servant has found the courage to pray this prayer to You.
102Sm 7:28 Lord God, You are God; Your words are true, and You have promised this grace to Your servant.
102Sm 7:29 Now, please bless Your servant's house so that it will continue before You forever. For You, Lord God, have spoken, and with Your blessing Your servant's house will be blessed forever."
102Sm 8:1 After this, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah from Philistine control.
102Sm 8:2 He also defeated the Moabites, and after making them lie down on the ground, he measured them off with a cord. He measured every two cord lengths [of those] to be put to death and one length [of those] to be kept alive. So the Moabites became David's subjects and brought tribute.
102Sm 8:3 David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, who went to restore his control at the Euphrates River.
102Sm 8:4 David captured 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers from him, and he hamstrung all the horses, and he kept 100 chariots.
102Sm 8:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to assist King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Aramean men.
102Sm 8:6 Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became David's subjects and brought tribute. The LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
102Sm 8:7 David took the gold shields of Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
102Sm 8:8 King David also took huge quantities of bronze from Betah and Berothai, Hadadezer's cities.
102Sm 8:9 When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
102Sm 8:10 he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Toi and Hadadezer had fought many wars. Joram had items of silver, gold, and bronze with him.
102Sm 8:11 King David also dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued--
102Sm 8:12 from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, the Amalekites, and the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
102Sm 8:13 David made a reputation for himself when he returned from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
102Sm 8:14 He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. The LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
102Sm 8:15 So David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people.
102Sm 8:16 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
102Sm 8:17 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was court secretary;
102Sm 8:18 Benaiah son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief officials.
102Sm 9:1 David asked, "Is there anyone remaining from Saul's family I can show kindness to because of Jonathan?"
102Sm 9:2 There was a servant of Saul's family named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" "[I am] your servant," he replied.
102Sm 9:3 So the king asked, "Is there anyone left of Saul's family I can show the kindness of God to?" Ziba said to the king, "There is still Jonathan's son who is lame in both feet."
102Sm 9:4 The king asked him, "Where is he?" Ziba answered the king, "You'll find him in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel."
102Sm 9:5 So King David had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
102Sm 9:6 Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul came to David, bowed down to the ground and paid homage. David said, "Mephibosheth!" "I am your servant," he replied.
102Sm 9:7 "Don't be afraid," David said to him, "since I intend to show you kindness because of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all your grandfather Saul's fields, and you will always eat meals at my table."
102Sm 9:8 Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog like me?"
102Sm 9:9 Then the king summoned Saul's attendant Ziba and said to him, "I have given to your master's grandson all that belonged to Saul and his family.
102Sm 9:10 You, your sons, and your servants are to work the ground for him, and you are to bring in [the crops] so your master's grandson will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, is always to eat at my table." Now Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.
102Sm 9:11 Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do all my lord the king commands." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table just like one of the king's sons.
102Sm 9:12 Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. All those living in Ziba's house were Mephibosheth's servants.
102Sm 9:13 However, Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem because he always ate at the king's table. He was lame in both feet.
102Sm 10:1 Some time later the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king in his place.
102Sm 10:2 Then David said, "I'll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent his emissaries to console Hanun concerning his father. However, when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
102Sm 10:3 the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun their lord, "Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he's showing respect for your father? Instead, hasn't David sent his emissaries in order to scout out the city, spy on it, and overthrow it?"
102Sm 10:4 So Hanun took David's emissaries, shaved off half their beards, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away.
102Sm 10:5 When this was reported to David, he sent [someone] to meet them, since they were deeply humiliated. The king said, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return."
102Sm 10:6 When the Ammonites realized they had become repulsive to David, they hired 20,000 foot soldiers from the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, 1,000 men from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 men from Tob.
102Sm 10:7 David heard about it and sent Joab and all the fighting men.
102Sm 10:8 The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance to the city gate while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were in the field by themselves.
102Sm 10:9 When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some men out of all the elite troops of Israel and lined up in battle formation to engage the Arameans.
102Sm 10:10 He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai who lined up in battle formation to engage the Ammonites.
102Sm 10:11 "If the Arameans are too strong for me," Joab said, "then you will be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I'll come to help you.
102Sm 10:12 Be strong! We must prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD's will be done."
102Sm 10:13 Joab and his troops advanced to fight against the Arameans, and they fled before him.
102Sm 10:14 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai and entered the city. So Joab withdrew from the attack against the Ammonites and went to Jerusalem.
102Sm 10:15 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped.
102Sm 10:16 Hadadezer sent [messengers] to bring the Arameans who were across the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam with Shobach, commander of Hadadezer's army, leading them.
102Sm 10:17 When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and went to Helam. Then the Arameans lined up in formation to engage David in battle and fought against him.
102Sm 10:18 But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 of their charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach commander of their army, who died there.
102Sm 10:19 When all the kings who were Hadadezer's subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their subjects. After this, the Arameans were afraid to ever help the Ammonites again.
102Sm 11:1 In the spring when kings march out [to war], David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
102Sm 11:2 One evening David got up from his bed and strolled around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing-- a very beautiful woman.
102Sm 11:3 So David sent someone to inquire about her, and he reported, "This is Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite."
102Sm 11:4 David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. Now she had just been purifying herself from her uncleanness. Afterwards, she returned home.
102Sm 11:5 The woman conceived and sent word to inform David: "I am pregnant."
102Sm 11:6 David sent orders to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David.
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the troops were doing and how the war was going.
102Sm 11:8 Then he said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him.
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master's servants; he did not go down to his house.
102Sm 11:10 When it was reported to David, "Uriah didn't go home," David questioned Uriah, "Haven't you just come from a journey? Why didn't you go home?"
102Sm 11:11 Uriah answered David, "The ark, Israel, and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are camping in the open field. How can I enter my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live and by your life, I will not do this!"
102Sm 11:12 "Stay here today also," David said to Uriah, "and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
102Sm 11:13 Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him, and David got him drunk. He went out in the evening to lie down on his cot with his master's servants, but he did not go home.
102Sm 11:14 The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
102Sm 11:15 In the letter he wrote: Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest fighting, then withdraw from him so that he is struck down and dies.
102Sm 11:16 When Joab was besieging the city, he put Uriah in the place where he knew the best [enemy] soldiers were.
102Sm 11:17 Then the men of the city came out and attacked Joab, and some of the men from David's soldiers fell [in battle]; Uriah the Hittite also died.
102Sm 11:18 Joab sent someone to report to David all the details of the battle.
102Sm 11:19 He commanded the messenger, "When you've finished telling the king all the details of the battle--
102Sm 11:20 if the king's anger gets stirred up and he asks you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you realize they would shoot from the top of the wall?
102Sm 11:21 At Thebez, who struck Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth?Didn't a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the top of the wall so that he died? Why did you get so close to the wall?'-- then say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
102Sm 11:22 Then the messenger left. When he arrived, he reported to David all that Joab had sent him [to tell].
102Sm 11:23 The messenger reported to David, "The men gained the advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we counterattacked right up to the entrance of the gate.
102Sm 11:24 However, the archers shot down on your soldiers from the top of the wall, and some of the king's soldiers died. Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead."
102Sm 11:25 David told the messenger, "Say this to Joab: 'Don't let this matter upset you because the sword devours all alike. Intensify your fight against the city and demolish it.' Encourage him."
102Sm 11:26 When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah had died, she mourned for him.
102Sm 11:27 When the time of mourning ended, David had her brought to his house. She became his wife and bore him a son. However, the LORD considered what David had done to be evil.
102Sm 12:1 So the LORD sent Nathan to David. When he arrived, he said to him: There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor.
102Sm 12:2 The rich man had a large number of sheep and cattle,
102Sm 12:3 but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb that he had bought. It lived and grew up with him and his children. It shared his meager food and drank from his cup; it slept in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him.
102Sm 12:4 Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man could not bring himself to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for his guest.
102Sm 12:5 David was infuriated with the man and said to Nathan: "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
102Sm 12:6 Because he has done this thing and shown no pity, he must pay four lambs for that lamb."
102Sm 12:7 Nathan replied to David, "You are the man! This is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
102Sm 12:8 I gave your master's house to you and your master's wives into your arms, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more.
102Sm 12:9 Why then have you despised the command of the LORD by doing what I consider evil? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife as your own wife-- you murdered him with the Ammonite's sword.
102Sm 12:10 Now therefore, the sword will never leave your house because you despised Me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own wife.'
102Sm 12:11 "This is what the LORD says, 'I am going to bring disaster on you from your own family: I will take your wives and give them to another before your very eyes, and he will sleep with them publicly.
102Sm 12:12 You acted in secret, but I will do this before all Israel and in broad daylight.'"
102Sm 12:13 David responded to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Then Nathan replied to David, "The LORD has taken away your sin; you will not die.
102Sm 12:14 However, because you treated the LORD with such contempt in this matter, the son born to you will die."
102Sm 12:15 Then Nathan went home. The LORD struck the baby that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill.
102Sm 12:16 David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted, went [home], and spent the night lying on the ground.
102Sm 12:17 The elders of his house stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them.
102Sm 12:18 On the seventh day the baby died. But David's servants were afraid to tell him the baby was dead. They said, "Look, while the baby was alive, we spoke to him, and he wouldn't listen to us. So how can we tell him the baby is dead? He may do something desperate."
102Sm 12:19 When David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, he guessed that the baby was dead. So he asked his servants, "Is the baby dead?" "He is dead," they replied.
102Sm 12:20 Then David got up from the ground. He washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, went to the LORD's house, and worshiped. Then he went home and requested [something to eat]. So they served him food, and he ate.
102Sm 12:21 His servants asked him, "What did you just do? While the baby was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate food."
102Sm 12:22 He answered, "While the baby was alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let him live.'
102Sm 12:23 But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I'll go to him, but he will never return to me."
102Sm 12:24 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba; he went and slept with her. She gave birth to a son and named him Solomon.The LORD loved him,
102Sm 12:25 and He sent [a message] through Nathan the prophet, who named him Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
102Sm 12:26 Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal fortress.
102Sm 12:27 Then Joab sent messengers to David to say, "I have fought against Rabbah and have also captured the water supply.
102Sm 12:28 Now therefore, assemble the rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise I will be the one to capture the city, and it will be named after me.
102Sm 12:29 So David assembled all the troops and went to Rabbah; he fought against it and captured it.
102Sm 12:30 He took the crown from the head of their king, and it was [placed] on David's head. The crown weighed 75 pounds of gold, and it had a precious stone [in it]. In addition, David took away a large quantity of plunder from the city.
102Sm 12:31 He removed the people who were in the city and put [them to work] with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and to labor at brickmaking. He did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then he and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 13:1 Some time passed. David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David's son Amnon was infatuated with her.
102Sm 13:2 Amnon was frustrated to the point of making himself sick over his sister Tamar because she was a virgin, but it seemed impossible to do anything to her.
102Sm 13:3 Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, a son of David's brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man,
102Sm 13:4 and he asked Amnon, "Why are you, the king's son, so miserable every morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon replied, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
102Sm 13:5 Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend you're sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me [something] to eat. Let her prepare food in my presence so I can watch and eat from her hand.'"
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my presence so I can eat from her hand."
102Sm 13:7 David sent word to Tamar at the palace: "Please go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare a meal for him."
102Sm 13:8 Then Tamar went to his house while Amnon was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his presence, and baked them.
102Sm 13:9 She brought the pan and set it down in front of him, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, "Everyone leave me!" And everyone left him.
102Sm 13:10 "Bring the meal to the bedroom," Amnon told Tamar, "so I can eat from your hand." Tamar took the cakes she had made and went to her brother Amnon's bedroom.
102Sm 13:11 When she brought [them] to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come sleep with me, my sister!"
102Sm 13:12 "Don't, my brother!" she cried. "Don't humiliate me, for such a thing should never be done in Israel. Don't do this horrible thing!
102Sm 13:13 Where could I ever go with my disgrace? And you-- you would be like one of the immoral men in Israel! Please, speak to the king, for he won't keep me from you."
102Sm 13:14 But he refused to listen to her, and because he was stronger than she was, he raped her.
102Sm 13:15 After this, Amnon hated Tamar with such intensity that the hatred he hated her with was greater than the love he had loved her with. "Get out of here!" he said.
102Sm 13:16 "No," she cried, "sending me away is much worse than the great wrong you've already done to me!" But he refused to listen to her.
102Sm 13:17 Instead, he called to the servant who waited on him: "Throw this woman out and bolt the door behind her!"
102Sm 13:18 Amnon's servant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a long-sleeved garment, because this is what the king's virgin daughters wore.
102Sm 13:19 Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long-sleeved garment she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away weeping.
102Sm 13:20 Her brother Absalom said to her: "Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom.
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard about all these things, he was furious.
102Sm 13:22 Absalom didn't say anything to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon since he disgraced his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:23 Two years later, Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
102Sm 13:24 Then he went to the king and said, "Your servant has just hired sheepshearers. Will the king and his servants please come with your servant?"
102Sm 13:25 The king replied to Absalom, "No, my son, we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he wasn't willing to go, though he did bless him.
102Sm 13:26 "If not," Absalom said, "please let my brother Amnon go with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom urged him, so he sent Amnon and all the king's sons.
102Sm 13:28 Now Absalom commanded his young men, "Watch Amnon until he is in a good mood from the wine. When I order you to strike Amnon, then kill him. Don't be afraid. Am I not the one who has commanded you? Be strong and courageous!"
102Sm 13:29 So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all [the rest of] the king's sons got up, and each fled on his mule.
102Sm 13:30 While they were on the way, a report reached David: "Absalom struck down all the king's sons; not even one of them survived!"
102Sm 13:31 In response the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
102Sm 13:32 But Jonadab, son of David's brother Shimeah, spoke up: "My lord must not think they have killed all the young men, the king's sons, because only Amnon is dead. In fact, Absalom has planned this ever since the day Amnon disgraced his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:33 So now, my lord the king, don't take seriously the report that says all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead."
102Sm 13:34 Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. When the young man who was standing watch looked up, there were many people coming from the road west of him from the side of the mountain.
102Sm 13:35 Jonadab said to the king, "Look, the king's sons have come! It's exactly like your servant said."
102Sm 13:36 Just as he finished speaking, the king's sons entered and wept loudly. Then the king and all his servants also wept bitterly.
102Sm 13:37 Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
102Sm 13:38 Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur where he stayed three years.
102Sm 13:39 Then King David longed to go to Absalom, for David had finished grieving over Amnon's death.
102Sm 14:1 Joab son of Zeruiah observed that the king's mind was on Absalom.
102Sm 14:2 So Joab sent someone to Tekoa to bring a clever woman from there. He told her, "Pretend to be in mourning: dress in mourning clothes and don't put on any oil. Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time.
102Sm 14:3 Go to the king and speak these words to him." Then Joab told her exactly what to say.
102Sm 14:4 When the woman from Tekoa came to the king, she fell with her face to the ground in homage and said, "Help me, my king!"
102Sm 14:5 "What's the matter?" the king asked her. "To tell the truth, I am a widow; my husband died," she said.
102Sm 14:6 "Your servant had two sons. They were fighting in the field with no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
102Sm 14:7 Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant and said, 'Hand over the one who killed his brother so we may put him to death for the life of the brother he murdered. We will destroy the heir!' They would extinguish my one remaining ember by not preserving my husband's name or posterity on earth."
102Sm 14:8 The king told the woman, "Go home. I will issue a command on your behalf."
102Sm 14:9 Then the woman of Tekoa said to the king, "My lord the king, may any blame be on me and my father's house, and may the king and his throne be innocent."
102Sm 14:10 "Whoever speaks to you," the king said, "bring him to me. He will not trouble you again!"
102Sm 14:11 She replied, "Please, may the king invoke the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood will not increase the loss, and they will not eliminate my son!" "As the LORD lives," he vowed, "not a hair of your son will fall to the ground."
102Sm 14:12 Then the woman said, "Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?" "Speak," he replied.
102Sm 14:13 The woman asked, "Why have you devised something similar against the people of God? When the king spoke as he did about this matter, he has pronounced his own guilt. The king has not brought back his own banished one.
102Sm 14:14 For we will certainly die and be like water poured out on the ground, which can't be recovered. But God would not take away a life; He would devise plans so that the one banished from Him does not remain banished.
102Sm 14:15 "Now therefore, I've come to present this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought: I must speak to the king. Perhaps the king will grant his servant's request.
102Sm 14:16 The king will surely listen in order to rescue his servant from the hand of this man who would eliminate both me and my son from God's inheritance.
102Sm 14:17 Your servant thought: May the word of my lord the king bring relief, for my lord the king is able to discern the good and the bad like the Angel of God. May the LORD your God be with you."
102Sm 14:18 Then the king answered the woman, "I'm going to ask you something; don't conceal it from me!" "Let my lord the king speak," the woman replied.
102Sm 14:19 The king asked, "Did Joab put you up to all this?" The woman answered. "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or left from all my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave orders to me; he told your servant exactly what to say.
102Sm 14:20 Joab your servant has done this to address the issue indirectly, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the Angel of God, knowing everything on earth."
102Sm 14:21 Then the king said to Joab, "I hereby grant this request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."
102Sm 14:22 Joab fell with his face to the ground in homage and praised the king. "Today," Joab said, "your servant knows I have found favor with you, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant."
102Sm 14:23 So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
102Sm 14:24 However, the king added, "He may return to his house, but he may not see my face." So Absalom returned to his house, but he did not see the king.
102Sm 14:25 No man in all Israel was as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.
102Sm 14:26 When he shaved his head-- he shaved [it] every year because [his hair] got so heavy for him that he had to shave it off-- he would weigh the hair from his head and it would be five pounds according to the royal standard.
102Sm 14:27 Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman.
102Sm 14:28 Absalom resided in Jerusalem two years but never saw the king.
102Sm 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab was unwilling to come. So he sent again, a second time, but he still wouldn't come.
102Sm 14:30 Then Absalom said to his servants, "See, Joab has a field right next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set fire to it!" So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
102Sm 14:31 Then Joab came to Absalom's house and demanded, "Why did your servants set my field on fire?"
102Sm 14:32 "Look," Absalom explained to Joab, "I sent for you and said, 'Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? I'd be better off if I were still there.' So now, let me see the king. If I am guilty, let him kill me."
102Sm 14:33 Joab went to the king and told him. So David summoned Absalom, who came to the king and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.
102Sm 15:1 After this, Absalom got himself a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run before him.
102Sm 15:2 He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for settlement, Absalom called out to him and asked, "What city are you from?" If he replied, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,"
102Sm 15:3 Absalom said to him, "Look, your claims are good and right, but the king does not have anyone to listen to you."
102Sm 15:4 He added, "If only someone would appoint me judge in the land. Then anyone who had a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would make sure he received justice."
102Sm 15:5 When a person approached to bow down to him, Absalom reached out his hand, took hold of him, and kissed him.
102Sm 15:6 Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for a settlement. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
102Sm 15:7 When four years had passed, Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I made to the Lord.
102Sm 15:8 For your servant made a vow when I lived in Geshur of Aram, saying: If the LORD really brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron."
102Sm 15:9 "Go in peace," the king said to him. So he went to Hebron.
102Sm 15:10 Then Absalom sent messengers throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: "When you hear the sound of the ram's horn, you are to say, 'Absalom has become king in Hebron!'"
102Sm 15:11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They had been invited and were going innocently, for they knew nothing about the whole matter.
102Sm 15:12 While he was offering the sacrifices, Absalom sent for David's adviser Ahithophel the Gilonite, from his city of Giloh. So the conspiracy grew strong, and the people supporting Absalom continued to increase.
102Sm 15:13 Then an informer came to David and reported, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."
102Sm 15:14 David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, "Get up. We have to flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! Leave quickly, or he will overtake us, heap disaster on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
102Sm 15:15 The king's servants said to him, "Whatever my lord the king decides, we are your servants."
102Sm 15:16 Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind 10 concubines to take care of the palace.
102Sm 15:17 So the king set out, and all the people followed him. They stopped at the last house
102Sm 15:18 while all his servants marched past him. Then all the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the Gittites-- 600 men who came with him from Gath-- marched past the king.
102Sm 15:19 The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why are you also going with us? Go back and stay with the king since you're both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.
102Sm 15:20 Besides, you only arrived yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I go wherever I can? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you kindness and faithfulness."
102Sm 15:21 But in response, Ittai vowed to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king is, whether it means life or death, your servant will be there!"
102Sm 15:22 "March on," David replied to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and the children who were with him.
102Sm 15:23 Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly while all the people were marching past. As the king was crossing the Kidron Valley, all the people were marching past on the road that leads to the desert.
102Sm 15:24 Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered [sacrifices] until the people had finished marching past.
102Sm 15:25 Then the king instructed Zadok, "Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, He will bring me back and allow me to see both it and its dwelling place.
102Sm 15:26 However, if He should say, 'I do not delight in you,' then here I am-- He can do with me whatever pleases Him."
102Sm 15:27 The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Look, return to the city in peace and your two sons with you: your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan.
102Sm 15:28 Remember, I'll wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there.
102Sm 15:30 David was climbing the slope of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he ascended. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. Each of the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they ascended.
102Sm 15:31 Then someone reported to David: "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." "LORD," David pleaded, "please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!"
102Sm 15:32 When David came to the summit where he used to worship God, there to meet him was Hushai the Archite with his robe torn and dust on his head.
102Sm 15:33 David said to him, "If you go away with me, you'll be a burden to me,
102Sm 15:34 but if you return to the city and tell Absalom, 'I will be your servant, my king! Previously, I was your father's servant, but now I will be your servant,' then you can counteract Ahithophel's counsel for me.
102Sm 15:35 Won't Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report everything you hear from the king's palace to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
102Sm 15:36 Take note: their two sons, Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan, are there with them. Send me everything you hear through them."
102Sm 15:37 So Hushai, David's personal adviser, entered Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city.
102Sm 16:1 When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, was right there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 [bunches] of summer fruit, and a skin of wine.
102Sm 16:2 The king said to Ziba, "Why do you have these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who become exhausted to drink in the desert."
102Sm 16:3 "Where is your master's son?" the king asked. "Why, he's staying in Jerusalem," Ziba replied to the king, "for he said, 'Today, the house of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me.'"
102Sm 16:4 The king said to Ziba, "All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!" "I bow [before you]," Ziba said. "May you look favorably on me, my lord the king!"
102Sm 16:5 When King David got to Bahurim, a man belonging to the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he was yelling curses as he approached.
102Sm 16:6 He threw stones at David and at all the royal servants, the people and the warriors on David's right and left.
102Sm 16:7 Shimei said as he cursed: "Get out, get out, you worthless murderer!
102Sm 16:8 The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul in whose place you rule, and the LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. Look, you are in trouble because you're a murderer!"
102Sm 16:9 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut his head off!"
102Sm 16:10 The king replied, "Sons of Zeruiah, do we agree on anything? He curses [me] this way because the LORD told him, 'Curse David!' Therefore, who can say, 'Why did you do that?'"
102Sm 16:11 Then David said to Abishai and all his servants, "Look, my own son, my own flesh and blood, intends to take my life-- how much more now this Benjaminite! Leave him alone and let him curse [me]; the LORD has told him to.
102Sm 16:12 Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and restore goodness to me instead of Shimei's curses today."
102Sm 16:13 So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei was going along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he cursed [David], and threw stones and dirt at him.
102Sm 16:14 Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived exhausted, so they rested there.
102Sm 16:15 Now Absalom and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem. Ahithophel was also with him.
102Sm 16:16 When David's friend Hushai the Archite came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
102Sm 16:17 "Is this your loyalty to your friend?" Absalom asked Hushai. "Why didn't you go with your friend?"
102Sm 16:18 "Not at all," Hushai answered Absalom. "I am on the side of the one that the LORD, the people, and all the men of Israel have chosen. I will stay with him.
102Sm 16:19 Furthermore, whom will I serve if not his son? As I served in your father's presence, I will also serve in yours."
102Sm 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give [me] your advice. What should we do?"
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel replied to Absalom, "Sleep with your father's concubines he left to take care of the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become repulsive to your father, everyone with you will be encouraged."
102Sm 16:22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
102Sm 16:23 Now the advice Ahithophel gave in those days was like someone asking about a word from God-- such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel's advice.
102Sm 17:1 Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose 12,000 men, and I will set out in pursuit of David tonight.
102Sm 17:2 I will attack him while he is weak and weary, throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will scatter. I will strike down only the king
102Sm 17:3 and bring all the people back to you. When everyone returns [except] the man you're seeking, all the people will be at peace."
102Sm 17:4 This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
102Sm 17:5 Then Absalom said, "Summon Hushai the Archite also. Let's hear what he has to say as well."
102Sm 17:6 So Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom told him: "Ahithophel offered this proposal. Should we carry out his proposal? If not, what do you say?"
102Sm 17:7 Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given this time is not good."
102Sm 17:8 Hushai continued, "You know your father and his men. They are warriors and are desperate like a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier who won't spend the night with the people.
102Sm 17:9 He's probably already hiding in one of the caves or some other place. If some of our troops fall first, someone is sure to hear and say, 'There's been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'
102Sm 17:10 Then, even a brave man with the heart of a lion will melt because all Israel knows that your father and the valiant men with him are warriors.
102Sm 17:11 Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba-- as numerous as the sand by the sea-- be gathered to you and that you personally go into battle.
102Sm 17:12 Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. Not even one will be left of all the men with him.
102Sm 17:13 If he retreats to some city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag its [stones] into the valley until not even a pebble can be found there."
102Sm 17:14 Since the LORD had decreed that Ahithophel's good advice be undermined in order to bring about Absalom's ruin, Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel's advice."
102Sm 17:15 Hushai then told the priests Zadok and Abiathar, "This is what Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I advised.
102Sm 17:16 Now send someone quickly and tell David, 'Don't spend the night at the wilderness ford [of the Jordan], but be sure to cross over, or the king and all the people with him will be destroyed.'"
102Sm 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, because they dared not be seen entering the city.
102Sm 17:18 However, a young man did see them and informed Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.
102Sm 17:19 Then his wife took the cover, placed it over the mouth of the well, and scattered grain on it so nobody would know anything.
102Sm 17:20 Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" "They passed by toward the water," the woman replied to them. The men searched but did not find [them], so they returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 17:21 After they had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well and went and informed King David. They told him, "Get up and immediately ford the river, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you."
102Sm 17:22 So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one who had not crossed the Jordan.
102Sm 17:23 When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He set his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb.
102Sm 17:24 David had arrived at Mahanaim by the time Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
102Sm 17:25 Now Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in Joab's place. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite;Ithra had married Abigail daughter of Nahash. Abigail was a sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
102Sm 17:26 And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
102Sm 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
102Sm 17:28 brought beds, basins, and pottery items. [They also brought] wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
102Sm 17:29 honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and the people with him to eat. They had reasoned, "The people must be hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the desert."
102Sm 18:1 David reviewed his troops and appointed commanders of hundreds and of thousands over them.
102Sm 18:2 He then sent out the troops, one third under Joab, one third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one third under Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, "I will also march out with you."
102Sm 18:3 "You must not go!" the people pleaded. "If we have to flee, they will not pay any attention to us. Even if half of us die, they will not pay any attention to us because you are worth 10,000 of us. Therefore, it is better if you support us from the city."
102Sm 18:4 "I will do whatever you think is best," the king replied to them. So he stood beside the gate while all the troops marched out by hundreds and thousands.
102Sm 18:5 The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake." All the people heard the king's orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
102Sm 18:6 Then David's forces marched into the field to engage Israel in battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim.
102Sm 18:7 The people of Israel were defeated by David's soldiers, and the slaughter there was vast that day-- 20,000 [casualties].
102Sm 18:8 The battle spread over the entire region, and that day the forest claimed more people than the sword.
102Sm 18:9 Absalom was riding on his mule when he happened to meet David's soldiers. When the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak tree, Absalom's head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so he was suspended in midair.
102Sm 18:10 One of the men saw [him] and informed Joab. He said, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!"
102Sm 18:11 "You just saw [him]!" Joab exclaimed. "Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you 10 silver pieces and a belt!"
102Sm 18:12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if I had the weight of 1,000 pieces of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king's son. For we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for me.'
102Sm 18:13 If I had jeopardized my own life-- and nothing is hidden from the king-- you would have abandoned me."
102Sm 18:14 Joab said, "I'm not going to waste time with you!" He then took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom's heart while he was still alive in the oak tree,
102Sm 18:15 and 10 young men who were Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.
102Sm 18:16 Afterwards, Joab blew the ram's horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab restrained them.
102Sm 18:17 They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. And all Israel fled, each to his tent.
102Sm 18:18 When he was alive, Absalom had erected for himself a pillar in the King's Valley, for he had said, "I have no son to preserve the memory of my name." So he gave the pillar his name. It is still called Absalom's Monument today.
102Sm 18:19 Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Please let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has delivered him from his enemies."
102Sm 18:20 Joab replied to him, "You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but today you aren't taking good news, because the king's son is dead."
102Sm 18:21 Joab then said to the Cushite, "Go tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running.
102Sm 18:22 However, Ahimaaz son of Zadok persisted and said to Joab, "No matter what, please let me run too behind the Cushite!" Joab replied, "My son, why do you want to run since you won't get a reward?"
102Sm 18:23 "No matter what I want to run!" "Then run!" Joab said to him. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
102Sm 18:24 David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gate and over to the wall. The watchman looked out and saw a man running alone.
102Sm 18:25 He called out and told the king. The king said, "If he's alone, he bears good news." As the first runner came closer,
102Sm 18:26 the watchman saw another man running. He called out to the gatekeeper, "Look! Another man is running alone!" "This one is also bringing good news," said the king.
102Sm 18:27 The watchman said, "The way the first man runs looks to me like the way Ahimaaz son of Zadok runs." "This is a good man; he comes with good news," the king commented.
102Sm 18:28 Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well," and then bowed down to the king with his face to the ground. He continued, "May the LORD your God be praised! He delivered up the men who rebelled against my lord the king."
102Sm 18:29 The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom all right?" Ahimaaz replied, "When Joab sent the king's servant and your servant, I saw a big disturbance, but I don't know what [it was]."
102Sm 18:30 The king said, "Move aside and stand here." So he stood to one side.
102Sm 18:31 Just then the Cushite came and said, "May my lord the king hear the good news: today the LORD has delivered you from all those rising up against you!"
102Sm 18:32 The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom all right?" The Cushite replied, "May what has become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king and to all who rise up against you with evil intent."
102Sm 18:33  The king was deeply moved and went up to the gate chamber and wept. As he walked, he cried, "My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:1 It was reported to Joab, "The king is weeping. He's mourning over Absalom."
102Sm 19:2 That day's victory was turned into mourning for all the troops because on that day the troops heard, "The king is grieving over his son."
102Sm 19:3 So they returned to the city quietly that day like people come in when they are humiliated after fleeing in battle.
102Sm 19:4 But the king hid his face and cried out at the top of his voice, "My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:5 Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, "Today you have shamed all your soldiers-- those who rescued your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, your wives, and your concubines.
102Sm 19:6 You love your enemies and hate those who love you! Today you have made it clear that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. In fact, today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would be fine with you!
102Sm 19:7 "Now get up! Go out and encourage your soldiers, for I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the trouble that has come to you from your youth until now!"
102Sm 19:8 So the king got up and sat in the gate, and all the people were told: "Look, the king is sitting in the gate." Then they all came into the king's presence. Meanwhile, each Israelite had fled to his tent.
102Sm 19:9 All the people among all the tribes of Israel were arguing: "The king delivered us from the grasp of our enemies, and he rescued us from the grasp of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
102Sm 19:10 But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?"
102Sm 19:11 King David sent word to the priests, Zadok and Abiathar: "Say to the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace? The talk of all Israel has reached the king at his house.
102Sm 19:12 You are my brothers, my flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to restore the king?'
102Sm 19:13 And tell Amasa, 'Aren't you my flesh and blood? May God punish me and do so severely if you don't become commander of the army from now on instead of Joab!'"
102Sm 19:14 So he won over all the men of Judah, and they sent word to the king: "Come back, you and all your servants."
102Sm 19:15 Then the king returned. When he arrived at the Jordan, Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and escort him across the Jordan.
102Sm 19:16 Shimei son of Gera, a Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
102Sm 19:17 There were 1,000 men from Benjamin with him. Ziba, an attendant from the house of Saul, with his 15 sons and 20 servants also rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king.
102Sm 19:18 They forded the Jordan to bring the king's household across and do whatever the king desired. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell down before the king
102Sm 19:19 and said to him, "My lord, don't hold me guilty, and don't remember your servant's wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart.
102Sm 19:20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. But look! Today I am the first one of the entire house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king."
102Sm 19:21 Abishai son of Zeruiah asked, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this, because he ridiculed the LORD's anointed?"
102Sm 19:22 David answered, "Sons of Zeruiah, do we agree on anything? Have you become my adversary today? Should any man be killed in Israel today? Am I not aware that today I'm king over Israel?"
102Sm 19:23 So the king said to Shimei, "You will not die." Then the king gave him his oath.
102Sm 19:24 Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet, trimmed his moustache, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
102Sm 19:25 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Mephibosheth, why didn't you come with me?"
102Sm 19:26 "My lord the king," he replied, "my servant [Ziba] betrayed me. Actually your servant said: 'I'll saddle the donkey for myself so that I may ride it and go with the king'-- for your servant is lame.
102Sm 19:27 Ziba slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like the Angel of God, so do whatever you think best.
102Sm 19:28 For my grandfather's entire family deserves death from my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. So what further right do I have to keep on making appeals to the king?"
102Sm 19:29 The king said to him, "Why keep on speaking about [these] matters of yours? I hereby declare: you and Ziba are to divide the land."
102Sm 19:30 Mephibosheth said to the king, "Instead, since my lord the king has come to his palace safely, let Ziba take it all!"
102Sm 19:31 Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim and accompanied the king to the Jordan River to see him off at the Jordan.
102Sm 19:32 Barzillai was a very old man-- 80 years old-- and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the needs of the king while he stayed in Mahanaim.
102Sm 19:33 The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me, and I'll provide for you at my side in Jerusalem."
102Sm 19:34 Barzillai replied to the king, "How many years of my life are left that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
102Sm 19:35 I'm now 80 years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the voice of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
102Sm 19:36 Since your servant is only going with the king a little way across the Jordan, why should the king repay me with such a reward?
102Sm 19:37 Please let your servant return so that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham: let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him what seems good to you."
102Sm 19:38 The king replied, "Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you, and whatever you desire from me I will do for you."
102Sm 19:39 So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned to his home.
102Sm 19:40 The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. All the troops of Judah and half of Israel's escorted the king.
102Sm 19:41 Suddenly, all the men of Israel came to the king. They asked him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and transport the king and his household across the Jordan, along with all of David's men?"
102Sm 19:42 All the men of Judah responded to the men of Israel, "Because the king is our relative. Why does this make you angry? Have we ever eaten anything of the king's or been honored at all?"
102Sm 19:43 The men of Israel answered the men of Judah: "We have 10 shares in the king, so we have a greater [claim] to David than you. Why then do you despise us? Weren't we the first to speak of restoring our king?" But the words of the men of Judah were harsher than those of the men of Israel.
102Sm 20:1 Now a wicked man, a Benjaminite named Sheba son of Bichri, happened to be there. He blew the ram's horn and shouted: We have no portion in David, no inheritance in Jesse's son. Each man to his tent, Israel!
102Sm 20:2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bichri, but the men of Judah from the Jordan all the way to Jerusalem remained loyal to their king.
102Sm 20:3 When David came to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the 10 concubines he had left to take care of the palace and placed them under guard. He provided for them, but he was not intimate with them. They were confined until the day of their death, living as widows.
102Sm 20:4 The king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to me within three days and be here yourself."
102Sm 20:5 Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time allotted him.
102Sm 20:6 So David said to Abishai, "Sheba son of Bichri will do more harm to us than Absalom. Take your lord's soldiers and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and elude us."
102Sm 20:7 So Joab's men, the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors marched out under Abishai's command; they left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:8 They were at the great stone in Gibeon when Amasa joined them. Joab was wearing his uniform and over it was a belt around his waist with a sword in its sheath. As he approached, [the sword] fell out.
102Sm 20:9 Joab asked Amasa, "Are you well, my brother?" Then with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him.
102Sm 20:10 Amasa was not on guard against the sword in Joab's hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it and spilled his intestines out on the ground. Joab did not stab him again for Amasa was dead. Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:11 One of Joab's young men had stood over Amasa saying, "Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!"
102Sm 20:12 Now Amasa was writhing in his blood in the middle of the highway, and the man had seen that all the people stopped. So he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him because he realized that all those who encountered Amasa were stopping.
102Sm 20:13 When he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by and followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
102Sm 20:14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah. All the Berites came together and followed him.
102Sm 20:15 Joab's troops came and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-maacah. They built an assault ramp against the outer wall of the city. While all the troops with Joab were battering the wall to make it collapse,
102Sm 20:16 a wise woman called out from the city, "Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come here and let me speak with him."
102Sm 20:17 When he had come near her, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he replied. "Listen to the words of your servant," she said to him. He answered, "I'm listening."
102Sm 20:18 She said, "In the past they used to say, 'Seek counsel in Abel,' and that's how they settled [disputes].
102Sm 20:19 I am a peaceful person, one of the faithful in Israel, but you're trying to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel. Why would you devour the LORD's inheritance?"
102Sm 20:20 Joab protested: "Never! I do not want to destroy!
102Sm 20:21 That is not [my] intention. There is a man named Sheba son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, who has rebelled against King David. Deliver this one man, and I will withdraw from the city." The woman replied to Joab, "All right. His head will be thrown over the wall to you."
102Sm 20:22 The woman went to all the people with her wise counsel, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the ram's horn, and they dispersed from the city, each to his own tent. Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:23 Joab commanded the whole army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;
102Sm 20:24 Adoram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
102Sm 20:25 Sheva was court secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
102Sm 20:26 and in addition, Ira the Jairite was David's priest.
102Sm 21:1 During David's reign there was a famine for three successive years, so David inquired of the LORD. The LORD answered, "It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family when he killed the Gibeonites."
102Sm 21:2 The Gibeonites were not Israelites but rather a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them, but Saul had tried to kill them in his zeal for the Israelites and Judah. So David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them.
102Sm 21:3 He asked the Gibeonites, "What should I do for you? How can I wipe out this guilt so that you will bring a blessing on the LORD's inheritance?"
102Sm 21:4 The Gibeonites said to him, "We are not asking for money from Saul or his family, and we cannot put anyone to death in Israel." "Whatever you say, I will do for you," he said.
102Sm 21:5 They replied to the king, "As for the man who annihilated us and plotted to exterminate us so we would not exist within the whole territory of Israel,
102Sm 21:6 let seven of his male descendants be handed over to us so we may hang them in the presence of the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the LORD's chosen." The king answered, "I will hand them over."
102Sm 21:7 David spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the oath of the LORD that was between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.
102Sm 21:8 But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, who were the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul, and the five sons whom Merabdaughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite
102Sm 21:9 and handed them over to the Gibeonites. They hanged them on the hill in the presence of the LORD; the seven of them died together. They were executed in the first days of the harvest at the beginning of the barley harvest.
102Sm 21:10 Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock from the beginning of the harvest until the rain poured down from heaven on the bodies. She kept the birds of the sky from them by day and the wild animals by night.
102Sm 21:11 When it was reported to David what Saul's concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done,
102Sm 21:12 he went and got the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the leaders of Jabesh-gilead. They had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung them the day the Philistines killed Saul at Gilboa.
102Sm 21:13 David had the bones brought from there. They also gathered up the bones of Saul's family who had been hung.
102Sm 21:14 They [also] buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan at Zela in the land of Benjamin in the tomb of Saul's father Kish. They did everything the king commanded. After this, God answered prayer for the land.
102Sm 21:15 The Philistines again waged war against Israel. David went down with his soldiers, and they fought the Philistines, but David became exhausted.
102Sm 21:16 Then Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giant, whose bronze spear weighed about eight pounds and who wore new armor, intended to kill David.
102Sm 21:17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David's men swore to him: "You must never again go out with us to battle. You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel."
102Sm 21:18 After this, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giant.
102Sm 21:19 Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.
102Sm 21:20 At Gath there was still another battle. A huge man was there with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot-- 24 in all. He, too, was descended from the giant.
102Sm 21:21 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David's brother Shimei, killed him.
102Sm 21:22 These four were descended from the giant in Gath and were killed by David and his soldiers.
102Sm 22:1 David spoke the words of this song to the LORD on the day the LORD rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
102Sm 22:2 He said: The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,
102Sm 22:3 my God, my mountain where I seek refuge. My shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior, You save me from violence.
102Sm 22:4 I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I was saved from my enemies.
102Sm 22:5 For the waves of death engulfed me; the torrents of destruction terrified me.
102Sm 22:6 The ropes of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
102Sm 22:7 I called to the LORD in my distress; I called to my God. From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for help [reached] His ears.
102Sm 22:8 Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the heavens trembled; they shook because He burned with anger.
102Sm 22:9 Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire [came] from His mouth; coals were set ablaze by it.
102Sm 22:10 He parted the heavens and came down, a dark cloud beneath His feet.
102Sm 22:11 He rode on a cherub and flew, soaring on the wings of the wind.
102Sm 22:12 He made darkness a canopy around Him, a gathering of water and thick clouds.
102Sm 22:13 From the radiance of His presence, flaming coals were ignited.
102Sm 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven; the Most High projected His voice.
102Sm 22:15 He shot arrows and scattered them; [He hurled] lightning bolts and routed them.
102Sm 22:16 The depths of the sea became visible, the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
102Sm 22:17 He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He pulled me out of deep waters.
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my powerful enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
102Sm 22:19 They confronted me in the day of my distress, but the LORD was my support.
102Sm 22:20 He brought me out to a wide-open place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
102Sm 22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; He repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
102Sm 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not turned from my God to wickedness.
102Sm 22:23 Indeed, I have kept all His ordinances in mind and have not disregarded His statutes.
102Sm 22:24 I was blameless before Him and kept myself from sinning.
102Sm 22:25 So the LORD repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight.
102Sm 22:26 With the faithful You prove Yourself faithful; with the blameless man You prove Yourself blameless;
102Sm 22:27 with the pure You prove Yourself pure, but with the crooked You prove Yourself shrewd.
102Sm 22:28 You rescue an afflicted people, but Your eyes are set against the proud-- You humble them.
102Sm 22:29 LORD, You are my lamp; the LORD illuminates my darkness.
102Sm 22:30 With You I can attack a barrier, and with my God I can leap over a wall.
102Sm 22:31 God-- His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is pure. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
102Sm 22:32 For who is God besides the LORD? And who is a rock? Only our God.
102Sm 22:33 God is my strong refuge; He makes my way perfect.
102Sm 22:34 He makes my feet like [the feet of] a deer and sets me securely on the heights.
102Sm 22:35 He trains my hands for war; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
102Sm 22:36 You have given me the shield of Your salvation; Your help exalts me.
102Sm 22:37 You widen [a place] beneath me for my steps, and my ankles do not give way.
102Sm 22:38 I pursue my enemies and destroy them; I do not turn back until they are wiped out.
102Sm 22:39 I wipe them out and crush them, and they do not rise; they fall beneath my feet.
102Sm 22:40 You have clothed me with strength for battle; You subdue my adversaries beneath me.
102Sm 22:41 You have made my enemies retreat before me; I annihilate those who hated me.
102Sm 22:42 They look, but there is no one to save [them]-- [they look] to the LORD, but He does not answer them.
102Sm 22:43 I pulverize them like dust of the earth; I crush them and trample them like mud in the streets.
102Sm 22:44 You have freed me from the feuds among my people; You have appointed me the head of nations; a people I had not known serve me.
102Sm 22:45 Foreigners submit to me grudgingly; as soon as they hear, they obey me.
102Sm 22:46 Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their fortifications.
102Sm 22:47 The LORD lives-- may my rock be praised! God, the rock of my salvation, is exalted.
102Sm 22:48 God-- He gives me vengeance and casts down peoples under me.
102Sm 22:49 He frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my adversaries; You rescue me from violent men.
102Sm 22:50 Therefore I will praise You, LORD, among the nations; I will sing about Your name.
102Sm 22:51 He is a tower of salvation for His king; He shows loyalty to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
102Sm 23:1 These are the last words of David: The proclamation of David son of Jesse, the proclamation of the man raised on high, the one anointed by the God of Jacob, the favorite singer of Israel:
102Sm 23:2 The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, His word was on my tongue.
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel spoke; the Rock of Israel said to me, "The one who rules the people with justice, who rules in the fear of God,
102Sm 23:4 is like the morning light when the sun rises on a cloudless morning, the glisten of rain on sprouting grass."
102Sm 23:5 Is it not true my house is with God? For He has established an everlasting covenant with me, ordered and secured in every [detail]. Will He not bring about my whole salvation and [my] every desire?
102Sm 23:6 But all the wicked are like thorns raked aside; they can never be picked up by hand.
102Sm 23:7 The man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear. They will be completely burned up on the spot.
102Sm 23:8 These are the names of David's warriors: Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite was chief of the officers. He wielded his spear against 800 [men] he killed at one time.
102Sm 23:9 After him, Eleazar son of Dodo son of Ahohi was among the three warriors with David when they defied the Philistines. The men of Israel retreated in the place they had gathered for battle,
102Sm 23:10 but Eleazar stood [his ground] and attacked the Philistines until his hand was tired and stuck to his sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. Then the troops came back to him, but only to plunder the dead.
102Sm 23:11 After him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had assembled [in formation] where there was a field full of lentils. The troops fled from the Philistines,
102Sm 23:12 but Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory.
102Sm 23:13 Three of the 30 leading [warriors] went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 23:14 At that time David was in the stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
102Sm 23:15 David was extremely thirsty and said, "If only someone would bring me water to drink from the well at the city gate of Bethlehem!"
102Sm 23:16 So three of the warriors broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the LORD.
102Sm 23:17 David said, "LORD, I would never do such a thing! Is this not the blood of men who risked their lives?" So he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three warriors.
102Sm 23:18 Abishai, Joab's brother and son of Zeruiah, was leader of the Three. He raised his spear against 300 [men] and killed them, gaining a reputation among the Three.
102Sm 23:19 Was he not the most honored of the Three? He became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.
102Sm 23:20 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was the son of a brave man from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. Benaiah killed two sons of Ariel of Moab, and he went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
102Sm 23:21 He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man. Even though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and then killed him with his own spear.
102Sm 23:22 These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors.
102Sm 23:23 He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
102Sm 23:24 Among the Thirty were: Joab's brother Asahel, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
102Sm 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
102Sm 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
102Sm 23:27 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
102Sm 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
102Sm 23:29 Heleb son of Baanah the Netophahite, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites,
102Sm 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the Wadis of Gaash,
102Sm 23:31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
102Sm 23:32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan son of
102Sm 23:33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
102Sm 23:34 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai son of the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
102Sm 23:35 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
102Sm 23:36 Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
102Sm 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah,
102Sm 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
102Sm 23:39 and Uriah the Hittite. There were 37 in all.
102Sm 24:1 The LORD's anger burned against Israel again, and it stirred up David against them to say: "Go, count [the people of] Israel and Judah."
102Sm 24:2 So the king said to Joab, the commander of his army, "Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba and register the troops so I can know their number."
102Sm 24:3 Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops 100 times more than they are-- while my lord the king looks on! But why does my lord the king want to do this?"
102Sm 24:4 Yet the king's order prevailed over Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army left the king's presence to register the troops of Israel.
102Sm 24:5 They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the valley, and then [proceeded] toward Gad and Jazer.
102Sm 24:6 They went to Gilead and to the land of the Hittites and continued on to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon.
102Sm 24:7 They went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Afterwards, they went to the Negev of Judah at Beer-sheba.
102Sm 24:8 When they had gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days.
102Sm 24:9 Joab gave the king the total of the registration of the troops. There were 800,000 fighting men from Israel and 500,000 men from Judah.
102Sm 24:10 David's conscience troubled him after he had taken a census of the troops. He said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I've done. Now, Lord, because I've been very foolish, please take away your servant's guilt."
102Sm 24:11 When David got up in the morning, a revelation from the LORD had come to the prophet Gad, David's seer:
102Sm 24:12 "Go and say to David, 'This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three [choices]. Choose one of them, and I will do it to you.'"
102Sm 24:13 So Gad went to David, told him [the choices], and asked him, "Do you want three years of famine to come on your land, to flee from your foes three months while they pursue you, or to have a plague in your land three days? Now, think it over and decide what answer I should take back to the One who sent me."
102Sm 24:14 David answered Gad, "I have great anxiety. Please, let us fall into the LORD's hands because His mercies are great, but don't let me fall into human hands."
102Sm 24:15 So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the appointed time, and from Dan to Beer-sheba 70,000 men died.
102Sm 24:16 Then the angel extended his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, but the LORD relented concerning the destruction and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough, withdraw your hand now!" The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
102Sm 24:17 When David saw the angel striking the people, he said to the LORD, "Look, I am the one who has sinned; I am the one who has done wrong. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let Your hand be against me and my father's family."
102Sm 24:18 Gad came to David that day and said to him, "Go up and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
102Sm 24:19 David went up in obedience to Gad's command, just as the LORD had commanded.
102Sm 24:20 Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, so he went out and bowed to the king with his face to the ground.
102Sm 24:21 Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David replied, "To buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to the LORD, so the plague on the people may be halted."
102Sm 24:22 Araunah said to David, "My lord the king may take whatever he wants and offer it. Here are the oxen for a burnt offering and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
102Sm 24:23 [My] king, Araunah gives everything here to the king." Then he said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you."
102Sm 24:24 The king answered Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it from you for a price, for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost [me] nothing." David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 ounces of silver.
102Sm 24:25 He built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer on behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel ended.
