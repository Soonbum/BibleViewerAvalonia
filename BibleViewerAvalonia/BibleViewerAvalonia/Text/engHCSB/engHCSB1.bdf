01Gn 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01Gn 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
01Gn 1:3 Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
01Gn 1:4 God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.
01Gn 1:5 God called the light "day," and He called the darkness "night." Evening came, and then morning: the first day.
01Gn 1:6 Then God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water."
01Gn 1:7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse. And it was so.
01Gn 1:8 God called the expanse "sky." Evening came, and then morning: the second day.
01Gn 1:9 Then God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.
01Gn 1:10 God called the dry land "earth," and He called the gathering of the water "seas." And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:11 Then God said, "Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kinds." And it was so.
01Gn 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it, according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:13 Evening came, and then morning: the third day.
01Gn 1:14 Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will serve as signs for festivals and for days and years.
01Gn 1:15 They will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth." And it was so.
01Gn 1:16 God made the two great lights-- the greater light to have dominion over the day and the lesser light to have dominion over the night-- as well as the stars.
01Gn 1:17 God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth,
01Gn 1:18 to dominate the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:19 Evening came, and then morning: the fourth day.
01Gn 1:20 Then God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."
01Gn 1:21 So God created the large sea-creatures and every living creature that moves and swarms in the water, according to their kinds. [He also created] every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:22 So God blessed them, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."
01Gn 1:23 Evening came, and then morning: the fifth day.
01Gn 1:24 Then God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so.
01Gn 1:25 So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals, all the earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth."
01Gn 1:27 So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God; He created them male and female.
01Gn 1:28 God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth."
01Gn 1:29 God also said, "Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. This food will be for you,
01Gn 1:30 for all the wildlife of the earth, for every bird of the sky, and for every creature that crawls on the earth-- everything having the breath of life in it. [I have given] every green plant for food." And it was so.
01Gn 1:31 God saw all that He had made, and it was very good. Evening came, and then morning: the sixth day.
01Gn 2:1 So the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
01Gn 2:2 By the seventh day, God completed His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done.
01Gn 2:3 God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it He rested from His work of creation.
01Gn 2:4 These are the records of the heavens and the earth, concerning their creation at the time that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
01Gn 2:5 No shrub of the field had yet [grown] on the land, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not made it rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground.
01Gn 2:6 But water would come out of the ground and water the entire surface of the land.
01Gn 2:7 Then the LORD God formed the man out of the dust from the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.
01Gn 2:8 The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there He placed the man He had formed.
01Gn 2:9 The LORD God caused to grow out of the ground every tree pleasing in appearance and good for food, including the tree of life in the midst of the garden, as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01Gn 2:10 A river went out from Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became the source of four rivers.
01Gn 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon, which encircles the entire land of the Havilah, where there is gold.
01Gn 2:12 Gold from that land is pure; bdellium and onyx are also there.
01Gn 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon, which encircles the entire land of Cush.
01Gn 2:14 The name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01Gn 2:15 The LORD God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work it and watch over it.
01Gn 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree of the garden,
01Gn 2:17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die."
01Gn 2:18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is like him."
01Gn 2:19 So the LORD God formed out of the ground each wild animal and each bird of the sky, and brought each to the man to see what he would call it. And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
01Gn 2:20 The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every wild animal; but for the man no helper was found who was like him.
01Gn 2:21 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to come over the man, and he slept. God took one of his ribs and closed the flesh at that place.
01Gn 2:22 Then the LORD God made the rib He had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man.
01Gn 2:23 And the man said: This one, at last, is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; this one will be called woman, for she was taken from man.
01Gn 2:24 This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh.
01Gn 2:25 Both the man and his wife were naked, yet felt no shame.
01Gn 3:1 Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You can't eat from any tree in the garden'?"
01Gn 3:2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden.
01Gn 3:3 But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.'"
01Gn 3:4 "No! You will not die," the serpent said to the woman.
01Gn 3:5 "In fact, God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
01Gn 3:6 Then the woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate [it]; she also gave [some] to her husband, [who was] with her, and he ate [it].
01Gn 3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
01Gn 3:8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and they hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
01Gn 3:9 So the LORD God called out to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
01Gn 3:10 And he said, "I heard You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid."
01Gn 3:11 Then He asked, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I had commanded you not to eat from?"
01Gn 3:12 Then the man replied, "The woman You gave to be with me-- she gave me [some fruit] from the tree, and I ate."
01Gn 3:13 So the LORD God asked the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "It was the serpent. He deceived me, and I ate."
01Gn 3:14 Then the LORD God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than any livestock and more than any wild animal. You will move on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.
01Gn 3:15 I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.
01Gn 3:16 He said to the woman: I will intensify your labor pains; you will bear children in anguish. Your desire will be for your husband, yet he will dominate you.
01Gn 3:17 And He said to Adam, "Because you listened to your wife's voice and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'Do not eat from it': The ground is cursed because of you. You will eat from it by means of painful labor all the days of your life.
01Gn 3:18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
01Gn 3:19 You will eat bread by the sweat of your brow until you return to the ground, since you were taken from it. For you are dust, and you will return to dust."
01Gn 3:20 Adam named his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the living.
01Gn 3:21 The LORD God made clothing out of skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.
01Gn 3:22 The LORD God said, "Since man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil, he must not reach out, and also take from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever."
01Gn 3:23 So the LORD God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
01Gn 3:24 He drove man out, and east of the garden of Eden He stationed cherubim with a flaming, whirling sword to guard the way to the tree of life.
01Gn 4:1 Adam knew his wife Eve intimately, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said, "I have had a male child with the LORD's help."
01Gn 4:2 Then she also gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel became a shepherd of a flock, but Cain cultivated the land.
01Gn 4:3 In the course of time Cain presented some of the land's produce as an offering to the LORD.
01Gn 4:4 And Abel also presented [an offering]-- some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions. The LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
01Gn 4:5 but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he was downcast.
01Gn 4:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you furious? And why are you downcast?
01Gn 4:7 If you do right, won't you be accepted? But if you do not do right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must master it."
01Gn 4:8 Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
01Gn 4:9 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's guardian?"
01Gn 4:10 Then He said, "What have you done? Your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground!
01Gn 4:11 So now you are cursed [with alienation] from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood you have shed.
01Gn 4:12 If you work the land, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
01Gn 4:13 But Cain answered the LORD, "My punishment is too great to bear!
01Gn 4:14 Since You are banishing me today from the soil, and I must hide myself from Your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me."
01Gn 4:15 Then the LORD replied to him, "In that case, whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." And He placed a mark on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him.
01Gn 4:16 Then Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01Gn 4:17 Cain knew his wife intimately, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain became the builder of a city, and he named the city Enoch after his son.
01Gn 4:18 Irad was born to Enoch, Irad fathered Mehujael, Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
01Gn 4:19 Lamech took two wives for himself, one named Adah and the other named Zillah.
01Gn 4:20 Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of the nomadic herdsmen.
01Gn 4:21 His brother was named Jubal; he was the father of all who play the lyre and the flute.
01Gn 4:22 Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. Tubal-cain's sister was Naamah.
01Gn 4:23 Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, pay attention to my words. For I killed a man for wounding me, a boy for striking me.
01Gn 4:24 If Cain is to be avenged seven times over, then for Lamech it will be seventy-seven times!
01Gn 4:25 Adam knew his wife intimately again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, for [she said,] "God has given me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
01Gn 4:26 A son was born to Seth also, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the LORD.
01Gn 5:1 These are the family records of the descendants of Adam. On the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God;
01Gn 5:2 He created them male and female. When they were created, He blessed them and called them man.
01Gn 5:3 Adam was 130 years old when he fathered [a child] in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
01Gn 5:4 Adam lived 800 years after the birth of Seth, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:5 So Adam's life lasted 930 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:6 Seth was 105 years old when he fathered Enosh.
01Gn 5:7 Seth lived 807 years after the birth of Enosh, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:8 So Seth's life lasted 912 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:9 Enosh was 90 years old when he fathered Kenan.
01Gn 5:10 Enosh lived 815 years after the birth of Kenan, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:11 So Enosh's life lasted 905 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:12 Kenan was 70 years old when he fathered Mahalalel.
01Gn 5:13 Kenan lived 840 years after the birth of Mahalalel, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:14 So Kenan's life lasted 910 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:15 Mahalalel was 65 years old when he fathered Jared.
01Gn 5:16 Mahalalel lived 830 years after the birth of Jared, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:17 So Mahalalel's life lasted 895 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:18 Jared was 162 years old when he fathered Enoch.
01Gn 5:19 Jared lived 800 years after the birth of Enoch, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:20 So Jared's life lasted 962 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:21 Enoch was 65 years old when he fathered Methuselah.
01Gn 5:22 And after the birth of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:23 So Enoch's life lasted 365 years.
01Gn 5:24 Enoch walked with God, and he was not there, because God took him.
01Gn 5:25 Methuselah was 187 years old when he fathered Lamech.
01Gn 5:26 Methuselah lived 782 years after the birth of Lamech, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:27 So Methuselah's life lasted 969 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:28 Lamech was 182 years old when he fathered a son.
01Gn 5:29 And he named him Noah, saying, "This one will bring us relief from the agonizing labor of our hands, caused by the ground the LORD has cursed."
01Gn 5:30 Lamech lived 595 years after Noah's birth, and he fathered sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:31 So Lamech's life lasted 777 years; then he died.
01Gn 5:32 Noah was 500 years old, and he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:1 When mankind began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them,
01Gn 6:2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were beautiful, and they took any they chose as wives for themselves.
01Gn 6:3 And the LORD said, "My Spirit will not remain with mankind forever, because they are corrupt. Their days will be 120 years."
01Gn 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth both in those days and afterwards, when the sons of God came to the daughters of man, who bore children to them. They were the powerful men of old, the famous men.
01Gn 6:5 When the LORD saw that man's wickedness was widespread on the earth and that every scheme his mind thought of was nothing but evil all the time,
01Gn 6:6 the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
01Gn 6:7 Then the LORD said, "I will wipe off the face of the earth: man, whom I created, together with the animals, creatures that crawl, and birds of the sky-- for I regret that I made them."
01Gn 6:8 Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
01Gn 6:9 These are the family records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries; Noah walked with God.
01Gn 6:10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
01Gn 6:12 God saw how corrupt the earth was, for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.
01Gn 6:13 Then God said to Noah, "I have decided to put an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
01Gn 6:14 "Make yourself an ark of gofer wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it with pitch inside and outside.
01Gn 6:15 This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
01Gn 6:16 You are to make a roof, finishing [the sides of the ark] to within 18 inches [of the roof.] You are to put a door in the side of the ark. Make it with lower, middle, and upper [decks].
01Gn 6:17 "Understand that I am bringing a deluge-- floodwaters on the earth to destroy all flesh under heaven with the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will die.
01Gn 6:18 But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark with your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives.
01Gn 6:19 You are also to bring into the ark two of every living thing of all flesh, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
01Gn 6:20 Two of everything-- from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from every animal that crawls on the ground according to its kind-- will come to you so that you can keep them alive.
01Gn 6:21 Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them."
01Gn 6:22 And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him.
01Gn 7:1 Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you [alone] are righteous before Me in this generation.
01Gn 7:2 You are to take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, of all the clean animals, and two of the animals that are not clean, a male and its female,
01Gn 7:3 and seven pairs, male and female, of the birds of the sky-- in order to keep offspring alive on the face of the whole earth.
01Gn 7:4 Seven days from now I will make it rain on the earth 40 days and 40 nights, and I will wipe off the face of the earth every living thing I have made."
01Gn 7:5 And Noah did everything that the LORD commanded him.
01Gn 7:6 Noah was 600 years old when the deluge came [and] water covered the earth.
01Gn 7:7 So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives entered the ark because of the waters of the deluge.
01Gn 7:8 From the clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and every creature that crawls on the ground,
01Gn 7:9 two of each, male and female, entered the ark with Noah, just as God had commanded him.
01Gn 7:10 Seven days later the waters of the deluge came on the earth.
01Gn 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the sources of the watery depths burst open, the floodgates of the sky were opened,
01Gn 7:12 and the rain fell on the earth 40 days and 40 nights.
01Gn 7:13 On that same day Noah along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah's wife, and his three sons' wives entered the ark with him.
01Gn 7:14 They [entered it] with all the wildlife according to their kinds, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that crawls on the earth according to its kind, all birds, every fowl, and everything with wings according to their kinds.
01Gn 7:15 Two of all flesh that has the breath of life in it entered the ark with Noah.
01Gn 7:16 Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered just as God had commanded him. Then the LORD shut him in.
01Gn 7:17 The deluge continued 40 days on the earth; the waters increased and lifted up the ark so that it rose above the earth.
01Gn 7:18 The waters surged and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
01Gn 7:19 Then the waters surged even higher on the earth, and all the high mountains under the whole sky were covered.
01Gn 7:20 The mountains were covered as the waters surged [above them] more than 20 feet.
01Gn 7:21 All flesh perished-- creatures that crawl on the earth, birds, livestock, wildlife, and all creatures that swarm on the earth, as well as all mankind.
01Gn 7:22 Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils-- everything on dry land died.
01Gn 7:23 He wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the ground, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
01Gn 7:24 And the waters surged on the earth 150 days.
01Gn 8:1 God remembered Noah, as well as all the wildlife and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water began to subside.
01Gn 8:2 The sources of the watery depths and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky stopped.
01Gn 8:3 The water steadily receded from the earth, and by the end of 150 days the waters had decreased significantly.
01Gn 8:4 The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.
01Gn 8:5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible.
01Gn 8:6 After 40 days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made,
01Gn 8:7 and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
01Gn 8:8 Then he sent out a dove to see whether the water on the earth's surface had gone down,
01Gn 8:9 but the dove found no resting place for her foot. She returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole earth. He reached out and brought her into the ark to himself.
01Gn 8:10 So Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove from the ark again.
01Gn 8:11 When the dove came to him at evening, there was a plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the water on the earth's surface had gone down.
01Gn 8:12 After he had waited another seven days, he sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again.
01Gn 8:13 In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the water [that had covered] the earth was dried up. Then Noah removed the ark's cover and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.
01Gn 8:14 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry.
01Gn 8:15 Then God spoke to Noah,
01Gn 8:16 "Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives with you.
01Gn 8:17 Bring out every living thing of all flesh that is with you-- birds, livestock, creatures that crawl on the ground-- and they will spread over the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
01Gn 8:18 So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, came out.
01Gn 8:19 All wildlife, all livestock, every bird, and every creature that crawls on the earth came out of the ark by their groups.
01Gn 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. He took some of every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
01Gn 8:21 When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said to Himself, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, even though man's inclination is evil from his youth. And I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done.
01Gn 8:22 As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night will not cease."
01Gn 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
01Gn 9:2 The fear and terror of you will be in every living creature on the earth, every bird of the sky, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are placed under your authority.
01Gn 9:3 Every living creature will be food for you; as [I gave] the green plants, I have given you everything.
01Gn 9:4 However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood in it.
01Gn 9:5 I will require the life of every animal and every man for your life and your blood. I will require the life of each man's brother for a man's life.
01Gn 9:6 Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in His image.
01Gn 9:7 But you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and multiply on it."
01Gn 9:8 Then God said to Noah and his sons with him,
01Gn 9:9 "Understand that I am confirming My covenant with you and your descendants after you,
01Gn 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you-- birds, livestock, and all wildlife of the earth that are with you-- all the animals of the earth that came out of the ark.
01Gn 9:11 I confirm My covenant with you that never again will all flesh be wiped out by the waters of a deluge; there will never again be a deluge to destroy the earth."
01Gn 9:12 And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all future generations:
01Gn 9:13 I have placed My bow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
01Gn 9:14 Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the bow appears in the clouds,
01Gn 9:15 I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh: water will never again become a deluge to destroy all flesh.
01Gn 9:16 The bow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh on earth."
01Gn 9:17 God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have confirmed between Me and all flesh on earth."
01Gn 9:18 Noah's sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
01Gn 9:19 These three were Noah's sons, and from them the whole earth was populated.
01Gn 9:20 Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
01Gn 9:21 He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent.
01Gn 9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
01Gn 9:23 Then Shem and Japheth took a cloak and placed it over both their shoulders, and walking backwards, they covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father naked.
01Gn 9:24 When Noah awoke from his drinking and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
01Gn 9:25 he said: Canaan will be cursed. He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers.
01Gn 9:26 He also said: Praise the LORD, the God of Shem; Canaan will be his slave.
01Gn 9:27 God will extend Japheth; he will dwell in the tents of Shem; Canaan will be his slave.
01Gn 9:28 Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood.
01Gn 9:29 So Noah's life lasted 950 years; then he died.
01Gn 10:1 These are the family records of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They also had sons after the deluge.
01Gn 10:2 Japheth's sons: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
01Gn 10:3 Gomer's sons: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
01Gn 10:4 And Javan's sons: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
01Gn 10:5 The coastland peoples spread out into their lands. These are [Japheth's sons] by their clans, in their nations. Each [group] had its own language.
01Gn 10:6 Ham's sons: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
01Gn 10:7 Cush's sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah's sons: Sheba and Dedan.
01Gn 10:8 Cush fathered Nimrod, who was the first powerful man on earth.
01Gn 10:9 He was a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD. That is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a powerful hunter in the sight of the LORD."
01Gn 10:10 His kingdom started with Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
01Gn 10:11 From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah,
01Gn 10:12 and Resen, between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
01Gn 10:13 Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
01Gn 10:14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (the Philistines came from them), and Caphtorim.
01Gn 10:15 Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn, and the Hittites,
01Gn 10:16 the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
01Gn 10:17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
01Gn 10:18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterwards the Canaanite clans scattered.
01Gn 10:19 The Canaanite border went from Sidon going toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and going toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01Gn 10:20 These are Ham's sons, by their clans, according to their languages, in their own lands and their nations.
01Gn 10:21 And Shem, Japheth's older brother, also had children. Shem was the father of all the children of Eber.
01Gn 10:22 Shem's sons were Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
01Gn 10:23 Aram's sons: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
01Gn 10:24 Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.
01Gn 10:25 Eber had two sons. One was named Peleg, for during his days the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
01Gn 10:26 And Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01Gn 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01Gn 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01Gn 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan's sons.
01Gn 10:30 Their settlements extended from Mesha to Sephar, the eastern hill country.
01Gn 10:31 These are Shem's sons by their clans, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
01Gn 10:32 These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their family records, in their nations. The nations on earth spread out from these after the flood.
01Gn 11:1 At one time the whole earth had the same language and vocabulary.
01Gn 11:2 As people migrated from the east, they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there.
01Gn 11:3 They said to each other, "Come, let us make oven-fired bricks." They had brick for stone and asphalt for mortar.
01Gn 11:4 And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise, we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
01Gn 11:5 Then the LORD came down to look over the city and the tower that the men were building.
01Gn 11:6 The LORD said, "If, as one people all having the same language, they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
01Gn 11:7 Come, let Us go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another's speech."
01Gn 11:8 So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city.
01Gn 11:9 Therefore its name is called Babylon, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
01Gn 11:10 These are the family records of Shem. Shem lived 100 years and fathered Arpachshad two years after the deluge.
01Gn 11:11 After he fathered Arpachshad, Shem lived 500 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:12 Arpachshad lived 35 years and fathered Shelah.
01Gn 11:13 After he fathered Shelah, Arpachshad lived 403 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:14 Shelah lived 30 years and fathered Eber.
01Gn 11:15 After he fathered Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:16 Eber lived 34 years and fathered Peleg.
01Gn 11:17 After he fathered Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:18 Peleg lived 30 years and fathered Reu.
01Gn 11:19 After he fathered Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:20 Reu lived 32 years and fathered Serug.
01Gn 11:21 After he fathered Serug, Reu lived 207 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:22 Serug lived 30 years and fathered Nahor.
01Gn 11:23 After he fathered Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:24 Nahor lived 29 years and fathered Terah.
01Gn 11:25 After he fathered Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and fathered [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:26 Terah lived 70 years and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
01Gn 11:27 These are the family records of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot.
01Gn 11:28 Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans, during his father Terah's lifetime.
01Gn 11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives: Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was named Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
01Gn 11:30 Sarai was barren; she had no child.
01Gn 11:31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran's son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
01Gn 11:32 Terah lived 205 years and died in Haran.
01Gn 12:1 The LORD said to Abram: Go out from your land, your relatives, and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
01Gn 12:2 I will make you into a great nation, I will bless you, I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01Gn 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, I will curse those who treat you with contempt, and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.
01Gn 12:4 So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran.
01Gn 12:5 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the people he had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
01Gn 12:6 Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem, at the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01Gn 12:7 But the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your offspring." So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him.
01Gn 12:8 From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and worshiped Him.
01Gn 12:9 Then Abram journeyed by stages to the Negev.
01Gn 12:10 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine in the land was severe.
01Gn 12:11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "Look, I know what a beautiful woman you are.
01Gn 12:12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will kill me but let you live.
01Gn 12:13 Please say you're my sister so it will go well for me because of you, and my life will be spared on your account."
01Gn 12:14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
01Gn 12:15 Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, so the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house.
01Gn 12:16 He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired flocks and herds, male and female donkeys, male and female slaves, and camels.
01Gn 12:17 But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with severe plagues because of Abram's wife Sarai.
01Gn 12:18 So Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
01Gn 12:19 Why did you say, 'She's my sister,' so that I took her as my wife? Now, here's your wife. Take her and go!"
01Gn 12:20 Then Pharaoh gave [his] men orders about him, and they sent him away, with his wife and all he had.
01Gn 13:1 Then Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev-- he, his wife, and all he had, and Lot with him.
01Gn 13:2 Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.
01Gn 13:3 He went by stages from the Negev to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been,
01Gn 13:4 to the site where he had built the altar. And Abram worshiped the LORD there.
01Gn 13:5 Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.
01Gn 13:6 But the land was unable to support them as long as they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they could not stay together,
01Gn 13:7 and there was quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land.
01Gn 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot, "Please, let's not have quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, since we are relatives.
01Gn 13:9 Isn't the whole land before you? Separate from me: if [you go] to the left, I will go to the right; if [you go] to the right, I will go to the left."
01Gn 13:10 Lot looked out and saw that the entire Jordan Valley as far as Zoar was well-watered everywhere like the LORD's garden and the land of Egypt. This was before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
01Gn 13:11 So Lot chose the entire Jordan Valley for himself. Then Lot journeyed eastward, and they separated from each other.
01Gn 13:12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot lived in the cities of the valley and set up his tent near Sodom.
01Gn 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were evil, sinning greatly against the LORD.
01Gn 13:14 After Lot had separated from him, the LORD said to Abram, "Look from the place where you are. Look north and south, east and west,
01Gn 13:15 for I will give you and your offspring forever all the land that you see.
01Gn 13:16 I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could be counted.
01Gn 13:17 Get up and walk from one end of the land to the other, for I will give it to you."
01Gn 13:18 So Abram moved his tent and went to live beside the oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.
01Gn 14:1 In those days Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim
01Gn 14:2 waged war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, as well as the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01Gn 14:3 All of these came as allies to the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).
01Gn 14:4 They were subject to Chedorlaomer for 12 years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01Gn 14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites in the mountains of Seir, as far as El-paran by the wilderness.
01Gn 14:7 Then they came back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they defeated all the territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
01Gn 14:8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and lined up for battle in the Valley of Siddim
01Gn 14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar-- four kings against five.
01Gn 14:10 Now the Valley of Siddim contained many asphalt pits, and [as] the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, [some] fell into them, but the rest fled to the mountains.
01Gn 14:11 The [four kings] took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went on.
01Gn 14:12 They also took Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, for he was living in Sodom, and they went on.
01Gn 14:13 One of the survivors came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was at the oaks belonging to Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and the brother of Aner. They were bound by a treaty with Abram.
01Gn 14:14 When Abram heard that his relative had been taken prisoner, he assembled his 318 trained men, born in his household, and they went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01Gn 14:15 And he and his servants deployed against them by night, attacked them, and pursued them as far as Hobah to the north of Damascus.
01Gn 14:16 He brought back all the goods and also his relative Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the [other] people.
01Gn 14:17 After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
01Gn 14:18 Then Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was a priest to God Most High.
01Gn 14:19 He blessed him and said: Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
01Gn 14:20 and give praise to God Most High who has handed over your enemies to you. And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
01Gn 14:21 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, but take the possessions for yourself."
01Gn 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand in an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
01Gn 14:23 that I will not take a thread or sandal strap or anything that belongs to you, so you can never say, 'I made Abram rich.'
01Gn 14:24 I will take nothing except what the servants have eaten. But as for the share of the men who came with me-- Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre-- they can take their share."
01Gn 15:1 After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great.
01Gn 15:2 But Abram said, "Lord God, what can You give me, since I am childless and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
01Gn 15:3 Abram continued, "Look, You have given me no offspring, so a slave born in my house will be my heir."
01Gn 15:4 Now the word of the LORD came to him: "This one will not be your heir; instead, one who comes from your own body will be your heir."
01Gn 15:5 He took him outside and said, "Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them." Then He said to him, "Your offspring will be that [numerous]."
01Gn 15:6 Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness.
01Gn 15:7 He also said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess."
01Gn 15:8 But he said, "Lord God, how can I know that I will possess it?"
01Gn 15:9 He said to him, "Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
01Gn 15:10 So he brought all these to Him, split them down the middle, and laid the pieces opposite each other, but he did not cut up the birds.
01Gn 15:11 Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
01Gn 15:12 As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell on Abram, and suddenly a terror and great darkness descended on him.
01Gn 15:13 Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know this for certain: Your offspring will be strangers in a land that does not belong to them; they will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years.
01Gn 15:14 However, I will judge the nation they serve, and afterwards they will go out with many possessions.
01Gn 15:15 But you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
01Gn 15:16 In the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."
01Gn 15:17 When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided [animals].
01Gn 15:18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "I give this land to your offspring, from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River:
01Gn 15:19 [the land of] the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
01Gn 15:20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim,
01Gn 15:21 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."
01Gn 16:1 Abram's wife Sarai had not borne him children. She owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar.
01Gn 16:2 Sarai said to Abram, "Since the LORD has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps I can have children by her." And Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
01Gn 16:3 So Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife for him. [This happened] after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan 10 years.
01Gn 16:4 He slept with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she looked down on her mistress.
01Gn 16:5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for my suffering! I put my slave in your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has looked down on me. May the LORD judge between me and you."
01Gn 16:6 Abram replied to Sarai, "Here, your slave is in your hands; do whatever you want with her." Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her.
01Gn 16:7 The Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur.
01Gn 16:8 He said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" She replied, "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai."
01Gn 16:9 Then the Angel of the LORD said to her, "You must go back to your mistress and submit to her mistreatment."
01Gn 16:10 The Angel of the LORD also said to her, "I will greatly multiply your offspring, and they will be too many to count."
01Gn 16:11 Then the Angel of the LORD said to her: You have conceived and will have a son. You will name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your [cry of] affliction.
01Gn 16:12 This man will be [like] a wild ass. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone's hand will be against him; he will live at odds with all his brothers.
01Gn 16:13 So she named the LORD who spoke to her: The God Who Sees, for she said, "Have I really seen here the One who sees me?"
01Gn 16:14 That is why she named the spring, "A Well of the Living One Who Sees Me." It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
01Gn 16:15 So Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son Hagar had.
01Gn 16:16 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
01Gn 17:1 When Abram was 99 years old, the LORD appeared to him, saying, "I am God Almighty. Live in My presence and be devout.
01Gn 17:2 I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you greatly."
01Gn 17:3 Then Abram fell to the ground, and God spoke with him:
01Gn 17:4 "As for Me, My covenant is with you, and you will become the father of many nations.
01Gn 17:5 Your name will no longer be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I will make you the father of many nations.
01Gn 17:6 I will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you.
01Gn 17:7 I will keep My covenant between Me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant to be your God and the [God] of your offspring after you.
01Gn 17:8 And to you and your offspring after you I will give the land where you are residing-- all the land of Canaan-- as an eternal possession, and I will be their God."
01Gn 17:9 God also said to Abraham, "As for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep My covenant.
01Gn 17:10 This is My covenant, which you are to keep, between Me and you and your offspring after you: Every one of your males must be circumcised.
01Gn 17:11 You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
01Gn 17:12 Throughout your generations, every male among you at eight days old is to be circumcised. This includes a slave born in your house and one purchased with money from any foreigner. The one who is not your offspring,
01Gn 17:13 a slave born in your house, as well as one purchased with money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.
01Gn 17:14 If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant."
01Gn 17:15 God said to Abraham, "As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai, for Sarah will be her name.
01Gn 17:16 I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will produce nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
01Gn 17:17 Abraham fell to the ground, laughed, and thought in his heart, "Can a child be born to a hundred-year-old man? Can Sarah, a ninety-year-old woman, give birth?"
01Gn 17:18 So Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael could live in Your presence!"
01Gn 17:19 But God said, "No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
01Gn 17:20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will certainly bless him; I will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly. He will father 12 tribal leaders, and I will make him into a great nation.
01Gn 17:21 But I will confirm My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year."
01Gn 17:22 When He finished talking with him, God withdrew from Abraham.
01Gn 17:23 Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house or purchased with his money-- every male among the members of Abraham's household-- and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, just as God had said to him.
01Gn 17:24 Abraham was 99 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised,
01Gn 17:25 and his son Ishmael was 13 years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised.
01Gn 17:26 On that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
01Gn 17:27 And all the men of his household-- both slaves born in his house and those purchased with money from a foreigner-- were circumcised with him.
01Gn 18:1 Then the LORD appeared to Abraham at the oaks of Mamre while he was sitting in the entrance of his tent during the heat of the day.
01Gn 18:2 He looked up, and he saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them and bowed to the ground.
01Gn 18:3 Then he said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, please do not go on past your servant.
01Gn 18:4 Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree.
01Gn 18:5 I will bring a bit of bread so that you may strengthen yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant's [way]. Later, you can continue on." "Yes," they replied, "do as you have said."
01Gn 18:6 So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, "Quick! Knead three measures of fine flour and make bread."
01Gn 18:7 Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd and got a tender, choice calf. He gave it to a young man, who hurried to prepare it.
01Gn 18:8 Then Abraham took curds and milk, and the calf that he had prepared, and set [them] before the men. He served them as they ate under the tree.
01Gn 18:9 "Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he answered.
01Gn 18:10 The LORD said, "I will certainly come back to you in about a year's time, and your wife Sarah will have a son!" Now Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent behind him.
01Gn 18:11 Abraham and Sarah were old and getting on in years. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
01Gn 18:12 So she laughed to herself: "After I have become shriveled up and my lord is old, will I have delight?"
01Gn 18:13 But the LORD asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Can I really have a baby when I'm old?'
01Gn 18:14 Is anything impossible for the LORD? At the appointed time I will come back to you, and in about a year she will have a son."
01Gn 18:15 Sarah denied it. "I did not laugh," she said, because she was afraid. But He replied, "No, you did laugh."
01Gn 18:16 The men got up from there and looked out over Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to see them off.
01Gn 18:17 Then the LORD said, "Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
01Gn 18:18 Abraham is to become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him.
01Gn 18:19 For I have chosen him so that he will command his children and his house after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just. This is how the LORD will fulfill to Abraham what He promised him."
01Gn 18:20 Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is immense, and their sin is extremely serious.
01Gn 18:21 I will go down to see if what they have done justifies the cry that has come up to Me. If not, I will find out."
01Gn 18:22 The men turned from there and went toward Sodom while Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
01Gn 18:23 Abraham stepped forward and said, "Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01Gn 18:24 What if there are 50 righteous people in the city? Will You really sweep it away instead of sparing the place for the sake of the 50 righteous people who are in it?
01Gn 18:25 You could not possibly do such a thing: to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. You could not possibly do that! Won't the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"
01Gn 18:26 The LORD said, "If at Sodom I find 50 righteous people in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
01Gn 18:27 Then Abraham answered, "Since I have ventured to speak to the Lord-- even though I am dust and ashes--
01Gn 18:28 suppose the 50 righteous lack five. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" He replied, "I will not destroy [it] if I find 45 there."
01Gn 18:29 Then he spoke to Him again, "Suppose 40 are found there?" He answered, "I will not do [it] on account of 40."
01Gn 18:30 Then he said, "Let the Lord not be angry, and I will speak further. Suppose 30 are found there?" He answered, "I will not do [it] if I find 30 there."
01Gn 18:31 Then he said, "Since I have ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose 20 are found there?" He replied, "I will not destroy [it] on account of 20."
01Gn 18:32 Then he said, "Let the Lord not be angry, and I will speak one more time. Suppose 10 are found there?" He answered, "I will not destroy [it] on account of 10."
01Gn 18:33 When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, He departed, and Abraham returned to his place.
01Gn 19:1 The two angels entered Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting at Sodom's gate. When Lot saw [them], he got up to meet them. He bowed [with his] face to the ground
01Gn 19:2 and said, "My lords, turn aside to your servant's house, wash your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and go on your way." "No," they said. "We would rather spend the night in the square."
01Gn 19:3 But he urged them so strongly that they followed him and went into his house. He prepared a feast and baked unleavened bread for them, and they ate.
01Gn 19:4 Before they went to bed, the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, the whole population, surrounded the house.
01Gn 19:5 They called out to Lot and said, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Send them out to us so we can have sex with them!"
01Gn 19:6 Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him.
01Gn 19:7 He said, "Don't do [this] evil, my brothers.
01Gn 19:8 Look, I've got two daughters who haven't had sexual relations with a man. I'll bring them out to you, and you can do whatever you want to them. However, don't do anything to these men, because they have come under the protection of my roof."
01Gn 19:9 "Get out of the way!" they said, adding, "This one came here as a foreigner, but he's acting like a judge! Now we'll do more harm to you than to them." They put pressure on Lot and came up to break down the door.
01Gn 19:10 But the angels reached out, brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
01Gn 19:11 They struck the men who were at the door of the house, both young and old, with a blinding light so that they were unable to find the door.
01Gn 19:12 Then the angels said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here: a son-in-law, your sons and daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of this place,
01Gn 19:13 for we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people is great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it."
01Gn 19:14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were going to marry his daughters. "Get up," he said. "Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
01Gn 19:15 At the crack of dawn the angels urged Lot on: "Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city."
01Gn 19:16 But he hesitated, so because of the LORD's compassion for him, the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters. And they brought him out and left him outside the city.
01Gn 19:17 As soon as the angels got them outside, one of them said, "Run for your lives! Don't look back and don't stop anywhere on the plain! Run to the mountains, or you will be swept away!"
01Gn 19:18 But Lot said to them, "No, Lord-- please.
01Gn 19:19 Your servant has indeed found favor in Your sight, and You have shown me great kindness by saving my life. But I can't run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
01Gn 19:20 Look, this town is close enough for me to run to. It is a small place. Please let me go there-- it's only a small place, isn't it?-- so that I can survive."
01Gn 19:21 And he said to him, "All right, I'll grant your request about this matter too, and will not overthrow the town you mentioned.
01Gn 19:22 Hurry up! Run there, for I cannot do anything until you get there." Therefore the name of the city is Zoar.
01Gn 19:23 The sun had risen over the land when Lot reached Zoar.
01Gn 19:24 Then the LORD rained burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah from the LORD out of the sky.
01Gn 19:25 He overthrew these cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground.
01Gn 19:26 But his wife looked back and became a pillar of salt.
01Gn 19:27 Early in the morning Abraham went to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
01Gn 19:28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw that smoke was going up from the land like the smoke of a furnace.
01Gn 19:29 So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the middle of the upheaval when He overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
01Gn 19:30 Lot departed from Zoar and lived in the mountains along with his two daughters, because he was afraid to live in Zoar. Instead, he and his two daughters lived in a cave.
01Gn 19:31 Then the firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us [as is] the custom of all the land.
01Gn 19:32 Come, let's get our father to drink wine so that we can sleep with him and preserve our father's line."
01Gn 19:33 So they got their father to drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and slept with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
01Gn 19:34 The next day the firstborn said to the younger, "Look, I slept with my father last night. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight so you can go sleep with him and we can preserve our father's line."
01Gn 19:35 That night they again got their father to drink wine, and the younger went and slept with him; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
01Gn 19:36 So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
01Gn 19:37 The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today.
01Gn 19:38 The younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today.
01Gn 20:1 From there Abraham traveled to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived in Gerar,
01Gn 20:2 Abraham said about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
01Gn 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman."
01Gn 20:4 Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, "Lord, would you destroy a nation even though it is innocent?
01Gn 20:5 Didn't he himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I did this with a clear conscience and clean hands."
01Gn 20:6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. I have also kept you from sinning against Me. Therefore I have not let you touch her.
01Gn 20:7 Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, you and all who are yours."
01Gn 20:8 Early in the morning Abimelech got up, called all his servants together, and personally told them all these things; and the men were terrified.
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said to him, "What have you done to us? How did I sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done."
01Gn 20:10 Abimelech also said to Abraham, "What did you intend when you did this thing?"
01Gn 20:11 Abraham replied, "I thought, 'There is absolutely no fear of God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.'
01Gn 20:12 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
01Gn 20:13 So when God had me wander from my father's house, I said to her: Show your loyalty to me wherever we go, and say about me: 'He's my brother.'"
01Gn 20:14 Then Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male and female slaves, gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him.
01Gn 20:15 Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you want."
01Gn 20:16 And to Sarah he said, "Look, I am giving your brother 1,000 pieces of silver. It is a verification of your honor to all who are with you. You are fully vindicated."
01Gn 20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could bear children,
01Gn 20:18 for the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech's household on account of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
01Gn 21:1 The LORD came to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised.
01Gn 21:2 Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time God had told him.
01Gn 21:3 Abraham named his son who was born to him-- the one Sarah bore to him-- Isaac.
01Gn 21:4 When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.
01Gn 21:5 Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01Gn 21:6 Sarah said, "God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me."
01Gn 21:7 She also said, "Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
01Gn 21:8 The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
01Gn 21:9 But Sarah saw the son mocking-- the one Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham.
01Gn 21:10 So she said to Abraham, "Drive out this slave with her son, for the son of this slave will not be a co-heir with my son Isaac!"
01Gn 21:11 Now this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son.
01Gn 21:12 But God said to Abraham, "Do not be concerned about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac.
01Gn 21:13 But I will also make a nation of the slave's son because he is your offspring."
01Gn 21:14 Early in the morning Abraham got up, took bread and a waterskin, [put them] on Hagar's shoulders, and sent her and the boy away. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beer-sheba.
01Gn 21:15 When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
01Gn 21:16 Then she went and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, "I can't [bear to] watch the boy die!" So as she sat nearby, she wept loudly.
01Gn 21:17 God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What's wrong, Hagar? Don't be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from the place where he is.
01Gn 21:18 Get up, help the boy up, and sustain him, for I will make him a great nation."
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the waterskin and gave the boy a drink.
01Gn 21:20 God was with the boy, and he grew; he settled in the wilderness and became an archer.
01Gn 21:21 He settled in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
01Gn 21:22 At that time Abimelech, with Phicol the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.
01Gn 21:23 Now swear to me here by God that you will not break an agreement with me or with my children and descendants. As I have kept faith with you, so you will keep faith with me and with the country where you are a resident alien."
01Gn 21:24 And Abraham said, "I swear [it]."
01Gn 21:25 But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the water well that Abimelech's servants had seized.
01Gn 21:26 Abimelech replied, "I don't know who did this thing. You didn't report anything to me, so I hadn't heard about it until today."
01Gn 21:27 Then Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.
01Gn 21:28 But Abraham had set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock.
01Gn 21:29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?"
01Gn 21:30 He replied, "You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand so that this act will serve as my witness that I dug this well."
01Gn 21:31 Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.
01Gn 21:32 After they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
01Gn 21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he worshiped the LORD, the Everlasting God.
01Gn 21:34 And Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for many days.
01Gn 22:1 After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he answered.
01Gn 22:2 "Take your son," He said, "your only [son] Isaac, whom you love, go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."
01Gn 22:3 So early in the morning Abraham got up, saddled his donkey, and took with him two of his young men and his son Isaac. He split wood for a burnt offering and set out to go to the place God had told him about.
01Gn 22:4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
01Gn 22:5 Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship; then we'll come back to you."
01Gn 22:6 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac. In his hand he took the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together.
01Gn 22:7 Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, "My father." And he replied, "Here I am, my son." Isaac said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
01Gn 22:8 Abraham answered, "God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." Then the two of them walked on together.
01Gn 22:9 When they arrived at the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.
01Gn 22:10 Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.
01Gn 22:11 But the Angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" He replied, "Here I am."
01Gn 22:12 Then He said, "Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from Me."
01Gn 22:13 Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
01Gn 22:14 And Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide, so today it is said: "It will be provided on the LORD's mountain."
01Gn 22:15 Then the Angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
01Gn 22:16 and said, "By Myself I have sworn, says the LORD: Because you have done this thing and have not withheld your only son,
01Gn 22:17 I will indeed bless you and make your offspring as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your offspring will possess the gates of their enemies.
01Gn 22:18 And all the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring because you have obeyed My command."
01Gn 22:19 Abraham went back to his young men, and they got up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham settled in Beer-sheba.
01Gn 22:20 Now after these things Abraham was told, "Milcah also has borne sons to your brother Nahor:
01Gn 22:21 Uz his firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel the father of Aram,
01Gn 22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
01Gn 22:23 And Bethuel fathered Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
01Gn 22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
01Gn 23:1 Now Sarah lived 127 years; [these were all] the years of her life.
01Gn 23:2 Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
01Gn 23:3 Then Abraham got up from beside his dead [wife] and spoke to the Hittites:
01Gn 23:4 "I am a resident alien among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead."
01Gn 23:5 The Hittites replied to Abraham,
01Gn 23:6 "Listen to us, lord. You are God's chosen one among us. Bury your dead in our finest burial place. None of us will withhold from you his burial place for burying your dead."
01Gn 23:7 Then Abraham rose and bowed down to the Hittites, the people of the land.
01Gn 23:8 He said to them, "If you are willing [for me] to bury my dead, listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
01Gn 23:9 to give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me in your presence, for the full price, as a burial place."
01Gn 23:10 Ephron was present with the Hittites. So in the presence of all the Hittites who came to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham:
01Gn 23:11 "No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead."
01Gn 23:12 Abraham bowed down to the people of the land
01Gn 23:13 and said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, "Please listen to me. Let me pay the price of the field. Accept it from me, and let me bury my dead there."
01Gn 23:14 Ephron answered Abraham and said to him,
01Gn 23:15 "My lord, listen to me. Land worth 400 shekels of silver-- what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."
01Gn 23:16 Abraham agreed with Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had agreed to in the hearing of the Hittites: 400 shekels of silver at the current commercial rate.
01Gn 23:17 So Ephron's field at Machpelah near Mamre-- the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the boundaries of the field-- became
01Gn 23:18 Abraham's possession in the presence of all the Hittites who came to the gate of his city.
01Gn 23:19 After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 23:20 The field with its cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham as a burial place.
01Gn 24:1 Abraham was now old, getting on in years, and the LORD had blessed him in everything.
01Gn 24:2 Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household who managed all he owned, "Place your hand under my thigh,
01Gn 24:3 and I will have you swear by the LORD, God of heaven and God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live,
01Gn 24:4 but will go to my land and my family to take a wife for my son Isaac."
01Gn 24:5 The servant said to him, "Suppose the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Should I have your son go back to the land you came from?"
01Gn 24:6 Abraham answered him, "Make sure that you don't take my son back there.
01Gn 24:7 The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from my native land, who spoke to me and swore to me, 'I will give this land to your offspring'-- He will send His angel before you, and you can take a wife for my son from there.
01Gn 24:8 If the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are free from this oath to me, but don't let my son go back there."
01Gn 24:9 So the servant placed his hand under his master Abraham's thigh and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
01Gn 24:10 The servant took 10 of his master's camels and departed with all kinds of his master's goods in hand. Then he set out for the town of Nahor, Aram-naharaim.
01Gn 24:11 He made the camels kneel beside a well of water outside the town at evening. [This was] the time when the women went out to draw water.
01Gn 24:12 "LORD, God of my master Abraham," he prayed, "grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
01Gn 24:13 I am standing here at the spring where the daughters of the men of the town are coming out to draw water.
01Gn 24:14 Let the girl to whom I say, 'Please lower your water jug so that I may drink,' and who responds, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels also'-- let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master."
01Gn 24:15 Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah-- daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor-- coming with a jug on her shoulder.
01Gn 24:16 Now the girl was very beautiful, a young woman who had not known a man intimately. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up.
01Gn 24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please let me have a little water from your jug."
01Gn 24:18 She replied, "Drink, my lord." She quickly lowered her jug to her hand and gave him a drink.
01Gn 24:19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I'll also draw water for your camels until they have had enough to drink."
01Gn 24:20 She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and hurried to the well again to draw water. She drew water for all his camels
01Gn 24:21 while the man silently watched her to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success.
01Gn 24:22 After the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel, and for her wrists two bracelets weighing 10 shekels of gold.
01Gn 24:23 "Whose daughter are you?" he asked. "Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
01Gn 24:24 She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
01Gn 24:25 She also said to him, "We have plenty of straw and feed, and a place to spend the night."
01Gn 24:26 Then the man bowed down, worshiped the LORD,
01Gn 24:27 and said, "Praise the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."
01Gn 24:28 The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.
01Gn 24:30 As soon as he had seen the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and when he had heard his sister Rebekah's words-- "The man said this to me!"-- he went to the man. He was standing there by the camels at the spring.
01Gn 24:31 Laban said, "Come, you who are blessed by the LORD. Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
01Gn 24:32 So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were given to the camels, and water was brought to wash his feet and the feet of the men with him.
01Gn 24:33 A meal was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." So Laban said, "Speak on."
01Gn 24:34 "I am Abraham's servant," he said.
01Gn 24:35 "The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 24:36 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.
01Gn 24:37 My master put me under this oath: 'You will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I live
01Gn 24:38 but will go to my father's household and to my family to take a wife for my son.'
01Gn 24:39 But I said to my master, 'Suppose the woman will not come back with me?'
01Gn 24:40 He said to me, 'The LORD before whom I have walked will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, and you will take a wife for my son from my family and from my father's household.
01Gn 24:41 Then you will be free from my oath if you go to my family and they do not give [her] to you-- you will be free from my oath.'
01Gn 24:42 "Today when I came to the spring, I prayed: LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You will make my journey successful!
01Gn 24:43 I am standing here at a spring. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, and I say to her: Please let me drink a little water from your jug,
01Gn 24:44 and who responds to me, 'Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels also'-- let her be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master's son.
01Gn 24:45 "Before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming with her jug on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her: Please let me have a drink.
01Gn 24:46 She quickly lowered her jug from her [shoulder] and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels also.' So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
01Gn 24:47 Then I asked her: Whose daughter are you? She responded, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
01Gn 24:48 Then I bowed down, worshiped the LORD, and praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who guided me on the right way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
01Gn 24:49 Now, if you are going to show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; if not, tell me, and I will go elsewhere."
01Gn 24:50 Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter.
01Gn 24:51 Rebekah is here in front of you. Take [her] and go, and let her be a wife for your master's son, just as the LORD has spoken."
01Gn 24:52 When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the LORD.
01Gn 24:53 Then he brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave [them] to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother.
01Gn 24:54 Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said, "Send me to my master."
01Gn 24:55 But her brother and mother said, "Let the girl stay with us for about 10 days. Then she can go."
01Gn 24:56 But he responded to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me away so that I may go to my master."
01Gn 24:57 So they said, "Let's call the girl and ask her opinion."
01Gn 24:58 They called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" She replied, "I will go."
01Gn 24:59 So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.
01Gn 24:60 They blessed Rebekah, saying to her: Our sister, may you become thousands upon ten thousands. May your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebekah and her young women got up, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
01Gn 24:62 Now Isaac was returning from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev region.
01Gn 24:63 In the early evening, Isaac went out to walk in the field, and looking up, he saw camels coming.
01Gn 24:64 Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she got down from her camel
01Gn 24:65 and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" The servant answered, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered herself.
01Gn 24:66 Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.
01Gn 24:67 And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah to be his wife. Isaac loved her, and he was comforted after his mother's [death].
01Gn 25:1 Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah,
01Gn 25:2 and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
01Gn 25:3 Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. Dedan's sons were the Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
01Gn 25:4 And Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah.
01Gn 25:5 Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac.
01Gn 25:6 And Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines, but while he was still alive he sent them eastward, away from his son Isaac, to the land of the East.
01Gn 25:7 This is the length of Abraham's life: 175 years.
01Gn 25:8 He took his last breath and died at a ripe old age, old and contented, and he was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.
01Gn 25:10 This was the field that Abraham bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.
01Gn 25:11 After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.
01Gn 25:12 These are the family records of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's slave, bore to Abraham.
01Gn 25:13 These are the names of Ishmael's sons; their names according to the family records are: Nebaioth, Ishmael's firstborn, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
01Gn 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
01Gn 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
01Gn 25:16 These are Ishmael's sons, and these are their names by their villages and encampments: 12 leaders of their clans.
01Gn 25:17 This is the length of Ishmael's life: 137 years. He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:18 And they settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt as you go toward Asshur. He lived in opposition to all his brothers.
01Gn 25:19 These are the family records of Isaac son of Abraham. Abraham fathered Isaac.
01Gn 25:20 Isaac was 40 years old when he took as his wife Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram, and sister of Laban the Aramean.
01Gn 25:21 Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife because she was barren. The LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
01Gn 25:22 But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
01Gn 25:23 And the LORD said to her: Two nations are in your womb; two people will [come] from you and be separated. One people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.
01Gn 25:24 When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.
01Gn 25:25 The first one came out reddish, covered with hair like a fur coat, and they named him Esau.
01Gn 25:26 After this, his brother came out grasping Esau's heel with his hand. So he was named Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born.
01Gn 25:27 When the boys grew up, Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.
01Gn 25:28 Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01Gn 25:29 Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, exhausted.
01Gn 25:30 He said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stuff, because I'm exhausted." That is why he was [also] named Edom.
01Gn 25:31 Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."
01Gn 25:32 "Look," said Esau, "I'm about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?"
01Gn 25:33 Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to him.
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave bread and lentil stew to Esau; he ate, drank, got up, and went away. So Esau despised his birthright.
01Gn 26:1 There was another famine in the land in addition to the one that had occurred in Abraham's time. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.
01Gn 26:2 The LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt. Live in the land that I tell you about;
01Gn 26:3 stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.
01Gn 26:4 I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky, I will give your offspring all these lands, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring,
01Gn 26:5 because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My mandate, My commands, My statutes, and My instructions."
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac settled in Gerar.
01Gn 26:7 When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say "my wife," [thinking], "The men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is a beautiful woman."
01Gn 26:8 When Isaac had been there for some time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
01Gn 26:9 Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, "So she is really your wife! How could you say, 'She's my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might die on account of her."
01Gn 26:10 Then Abimelech said, "What is this you've done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us."
01Gn 26:11 So Abimelech warned all the people with these words: "Whoever harms this man or his wife will certainly die."
01Gn 26:12 Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundred times [what was sown]. The LORD blessed him,
01Gn 26:13 and the man became rich and kept getting richer until he was very wealthy.
01Gn 26:14 He had flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and many slaves, and the Philistines were envious of him.
01Gn 26:15 The Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father's slaves had dug in the days of his father Abraham, filling them with dirt.
01Gn 26:16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave us, for you are much too powerful for us."
01Gn 26:17 So Isaac left there, camped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
01Gn 26:18 Isaac reopened the water wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. He gave them the same names his father had given them.
01Gn 26:19 Moreover, Isaac's slaves dug in the valley and found a well of spring water there.
01Gn 26:20 But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Quarrel because they quarreled with him.
01Gn 26:21 Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also, so he named it Hostility.
01Gn 26:22 He moved from there and dug another, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Open Spaces and said, "For now the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
01Gn 26:23 From there he went up to Beer-sheba,
01Gn 26:24 and the LORD appeared to him that night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your offspring because of My servant Abraham."
01Gn 26:25 So he built an altar there, worshiped the LORD, and pitched his tent there. Isaac's slaves also dug a well there.
01Gn 26:26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
01Gn 26:27 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me? You hated me and sent me away from you."
01Gn 26:28 They replied, "We have clearly seen how the LORD has been with you. We think there should be an oath between two parties-- between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you:
01Gn 26:29 You will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have only done what was good to you, sending you away in peace. You are now blessed by the LORD."
01Gn 26:30 So he prepared a banquet for them, and they ate and drank.
01Gn 26:31 They got up early in the morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
01Gn 26:32 On that same day Isaac's slaves came to tell him about the well they had dug, saying to him, "We have found water!"
01Gn 26:33 He called it Oath. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
01Gn 26:34 When Esau was 40 years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
01Gn 26:35 They made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.
01Gn 27:1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could not see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son." And he answered, "Here I am."
01Gn 27:2 He said, "Look, I am old and do not know the day of my death.
01Gn 27:3 Take your [hunting] gear, your quiver and bow, and go out in the field to hunt some game for me.
01Gn 27:4 Then make me the delicious food that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I can bless you before I die."
01Gn 27:5 Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac said to his son Esau. So while Esau went to the field to hunt some game to bring in,
01Gn 27:6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Listen! I heard your father talking with your brother Esau. He said,
01Gn 27:7 'Bring me some game and make some delicious food for me to eat so that I can bless you in the LORD's presence before I die.'
01Gn 27:8 Now obey every order I give you, my son.
01Gn 27:9 Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, and I will make them into a delicious meal for your father-- the kind he loves.
01Gn 27:10 Then take it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies."
01Gn 27:11 Jacob answered Rebekah his mother, "Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am a man with smooth skin.
01Gn 27:12 Suppose my father touches me. Then I will seem to be deceiving him, and I will bring a curse rather than a blessing on myself."
01Gn 27:13 His mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey me and go get them for me."
01Gn 27:14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made the delicious food his father loved.
01Gn 27:15 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were there at the house, and had her younger son Jacob wear them.
01Gn 27:16 She put the goatskins on his hands and the smooth part of his neck.
01Gn 27:17 Then she handed the delicious food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob.
01Gn 27:18 When he came to his father, he said, "My father." And he answered, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
01Gn 27:19 Jacob replied to his father, "I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may bless me."
01Gn 27:20 But Isaac said to his son, "How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?" He replied, "Because the LORD your God worked it out for me."
01Gn 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or not?"
01Gn 27:22 So Jacob came closer to his father Isaac. When he touched him, he said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
01Gn 27:23 He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
01Gn 27:24 Again he asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he replied, "I am."
01Gn 27:25 Then he said, "Serve me, and let me eat some of my son's game so that I can bless you." Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; he brought him wine, and he drank.
01Gn 27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Please come closer and kiss me, my son."
01Gn 27:27 So he came closer and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothes, he blessed him and said: Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
01Gn 27:28 May God give to you-- from the dew of the sky and from the richness of the land-- an abundance of grain and new wine.
01Gn 27:29 May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers; may your mother's sons bow down to you. Those who curse you will be cursed, and those who bless you will be blessed.
01Gn 27:30 As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had left the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau arrived from the hunt.
01Gn 27:31 He had also made some delicious food and brought it to his father. Then he said to his father, "Let my father get up and eat some of his son's game, so that you may bless me."
01Gn 27:32 But his father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am Esau your firstborn son."
01Gn 27:33 Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably. "Who was it then," he said, "who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all before you came in, and I blessed him. Indeed, he will be blessed!"
01Gn 27:34 When Esau heard his father's words, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me-- me too, my father!"
01Gn 27:35 But he replied, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
01Gn 27:36 So he said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice now. He took my birthright, and look, now he has taken my blessing." Then he asked, "Haven't you saved a blessing for me?"
01Gn 27:37 But Isaac answered Esau: "Look, I have made him a master over you, have given him all of his relatives as his servants, and have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then can I do for you, my son?"
01Gn 27:38 Esau said to his father, "Do you only have one blessing, my father? Bless me-- me too, my father!" And Esau wept loudly.
01Gn 27:39 Then his father Isaac answered him: Look, your dwelling place will be away from the richness of the land, away from the dew of the sky above.
01Gn 27:40 You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. But when you rebel, you will break his yoke from your neck.
01Gn 27:41 Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau determined in his heart: "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
01Gn 27:42 When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she summoned her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Listen, your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.
01Gn 27:43 So now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran,
01Gn 27:44 and stay with him for a few days until your brother's anger subsides--
01Gn 27:45 until your brother's rage turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose you both in one day?"
01Gn 27:46 So Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm sick of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like one of them, what good is my life?"
01Gn 28:1 Isaac summoned Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him: "Don't take a wife from the Canaanite women.
01Gn 28:2 Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father. Marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.
01Gn 28:3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become an assembly of peoples.
01Gn 28:4 May God give you and your offspring the blessing of Abraham so that you may possess the land where you live as an alien, the land God gave to Abraham."
01Gn 28:5 So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
01Gn 28:6 Esau noticed that Isaac blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to get a wife there. When he blessed him, Isaac commanded Jacob not to marry a Canaanite woman.
01Gn 28:7 And Jacob listened to his father and mother and went to Paddan-aram.
01Gn 28:8 Esau realized that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,
01Gn 28:9 so Esau went to Ishmael and married, in addition to his other wives, Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son. She was the sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 28:10 Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.
01Gn 28:11 He reached a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from the place, put it there at his head, and lay down in that place.
01Gn 28:12 And he dreamed: A stairway was set on the ground with its top reaching heaven, and God's angels were going up and down on it.
01Gn 28:13 The LORD was standing there beside him, saying, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your offspring the land that you are now sleeping on.
01Gn 28:14 Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out toward the west, the east, the north, and the south. All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
01Gn 28:15 Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
01Gn 28:16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."
01Gn 28:17 He was afraid and said, "What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven."
01Gn 28:18 Early in the morning Jacob took the stone that was near his head and set it up as a marker. He poured oil on top of it
01Gn 28:19 and named the place Bethel, though previously the city was named Luz.
01Gn 28:20 Then Jacob made a vow: "If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, if He provides me with food to eat and clothing to wear,
01Gn 28:21 and if I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God.
01Gn 28:22 This stone that I have set up as a marker will be God's house, and I will give to You a tenth of all that You give me."
01Gn 29:1 Jacob resumed his journey and went to the eastern country.
01Gn 29:2 He looked and saw a well in a field. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it because the sheep were watered from this well. A large stone covered the opening of the well.
01Gn 29:3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the [shepherds] would roll the stone from the opening of the well and water the sheep. The stone was then placed back on the well's opening.
01Gn 29:4 Jacob asked the men at the well, "My brothers! Where are you from?" "We're from Haran," they answered.
01Gn 29:5 "Do you know Laban son of Nahor?" Jacob asked them. They answered, "We know [him]."
01Gn 29:6 "Is he well?" Jacob asked. "Yes," they said, "and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with his sheep."
01Gn 29:7 Then Jacob said, "Look, it is still broad daylight. It's not time for the animals to be gathered. Water the flock, then go out and let them graze."
01Gn 29:8 But they replied, "We can't, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone is rolled from the well's opening. Then we will water the sheep."
01Gn 29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
01Gn 29:10 As soon as Jacob saw his uncle Laban's daughter Rachel with his sheep, he went up and rolled the stone from the opening and watered his uncle Laban's sheep.
01Gn 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.
01Gn 29:12 He told Rachel that he was her father's relative, Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father.
01Gn 29:13 When Laban heard the news about his sister's son Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him, and kissed him. Then he took him to his house, and Jacob told him all that had happened.
01Gn 29:14 Laban said to him, "Yes, you are my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him a month,
01Gn 29:15 Laban said to him, "Just because you're my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be."
01Gn 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters: the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel.
01Gn 29:17 Leah had delicate eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful.
01Gn 29:18 Jacob loved Rachel, so he answered Laban, "I'll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
01Gn 29:19 Laban replied, "Better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay with me."
01Gn 29:20 So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, and they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
01Gn 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my time is completed. I want to sleep with her."
01Gn 29:22 So Laban invited all the men of the place to a feast.
01Gn 29:23 That evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her.
01Gn 29:24 And Laban gave his slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her slave.
01Gn 29:25 When morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Wasn't it for Rachel that I worked for you? Why have you deceived me?"
01Gn 29:26 Laban answered, "It is not the custom in this place to give the younger [daughter in marriage] before the firstborn.
01Gn 29:27 Complete this week [of wedding celebration], and we will also give you this [younger] one in return for working yet another seven years for me."
01Gn 29:28 And Jacob did just that. He finished the week [of celebration], and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
01Gn 29:29 And Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave.
01Gn 29:30 Jacob slept with Rachel also, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
01Gn 29:31 When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
01Gn 29:32 Leah conceived, gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben, for she said, "The LORD has seen my affliction; surely my husband will love me now."
01Gn 29:33 She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, "The LORD heard that I am unloved and has given me this [son] also." So she named him Simeon.
01Gn 29:34 She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, "At last, my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi.
01Gn 29:35 And she conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children.
01Gn 30:1 When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob [any children], she envied her sister. "Give me sons, or I will die!" she said to Jacob.
01Gn 30:2 Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld children from you?"
01Gn 30:3 Then she said, "Here is my slave Bilhah. Go sleep with her, and she'll bear [children] for me so that through her I too can build [a family]."
01Gn 30:4 So Rachel gave her slave Bilhah to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.
01Gn 30:5 Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
01Gn 30:6 Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; yes, He has heard me and given me a son," and she named him Dan.
01Gn 30:7 Rachel's slave Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:8 Rachel said, "In [my] wrestlings with God, I have wrestled with my sister and won," and she named him Naphtali.
01Gn 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her slave Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01Gn 30:10 Leah's slave Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
01Gn 30:11 Then Leah said, "What good fortune!" and she named him Gad.
01Gn 30:12 When Leah's slave Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,
01Gn 30:13 Leah said, "I am happy that the women call me happy," so she named him Asher.
01Gn 30:14 Reuben went out during the wheat harvest and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother Leah, Rachel asked, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:15 But Leah replied to her, "Isn't it enough that you have taken my husband? Now you also want to take my son's mandrakes?" "Well," Rachel said, "you can sleep with him tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:16 When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So Jacob slept with her that night.
01Gn 30:17 God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
01Gn 30:18 Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband," and she named him Issachar.
01Gn 30:19 Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
01Gn 30:20 "God has given me a good gift," Leah said. "This time my husband will honor me because I have borne him six sons," and she named him Zebulun.
01Gn 30:21 Later, Leah bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb.
01Gn 30:23 She conceived and bore a son, and said, "God has taken away my shame."
01Gn 30:24 She named him Joseph: "May the LORD add another son to me."
01Gn 30:25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so that I can return to my homeland.
01Gn 30:26 Give me my wives and my children that I have worked for, and let me go. You know how hard I have worked for you."
01Gn 30:27 But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, [stay.] I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you."
01Gn 30:28 Then Laban said, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."
01Gn 30:29 So Jacob said to him, "You know what I have done for you and your herds.
01Gn 30:30 For you had very little before I came, but now your wealth has increased. The LORD has blessed you because of me. And now, when will I also do something for my own family?"
01Gn 30:31 Laban asked, "What should I give you?" And Jacob said, "You don't need to give me anything. If you do this one thing for me, I will continue to shepherd and keep your flock.
01Gn 30:32 Let me go through all your sheep today and remove every sheep that is speckled or spotted, every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the female goats. [Such] will be my wages.
01Gn 30:33 In the future when you come to check on my wages, my honesty will testify for me. [If I have] any female goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not black, they will be considered stolen."
01Gn 30:34 "Good," said Laban. "Let it be as you have said."
01Gn 30:35 That day Laban removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats-- every one that had any white on it-- and every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and he placed his sons in charge of them.
01Gn 30:36 He put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob, meanwhile, was shepherding the rest of Laban's flock.
01Gn 30:37 Jacob then took branches of fresh poplar, almond, and plane wood, and peeled [the bark], exposing white stripes on the branches.
01Gn 30:38 He set the peeled branches in the troughs in front of the sheep-- in the water channels where the sheep came to drink. And the sheep bred when they came to drink.
01Gn 30:39 The flocks bred in front of the branches and bore streaked, speckled, and spotted young.
01Gn 30:40 Jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked and the completely dark sheep in Laban's flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and didn't put them with Laban's sheep.
01Gn 30:41 Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the branches in the troughs, in full view of the flocks, and they would breed in front of the branches.
01Gn 30:42 As for the weaklings of the flocks, he did not put out the branches. So it turned out that the weak sheep belonged to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.
01Gn 30:43 And the man became very rich. He had many flocks, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 31:1 Now Jacob heard what Laban's sons were saying: "Jacob has taken all that was our father's and has built this wealth from what belonged to our father."
01Gn 31:2 And Jacob saw from Laban's face that his attitude toward him was not the same.
01Gn 31:3 Then the LORD said to him, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will be with you."
01Gn 31:4 Jacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field [where] his flocks were.
01Gn 31:5 He said to them, "I can see from your father's face that his attitude toward me is not the same, but the God of my father has been with me.
01Gn 31:6 You know that I've worked hard for your father
01Gn 31:7 and that he has cheated me and changed my wages 10 times. But God has not let him harm me.
01Gn 31:8 If he said, 'The spotted sheep will be your wages,' then all the sheep were born spotted. If he said, 'The streaked sheep will be your wages,' then all the sheep were born streaked.
01Gn 31:9 God has taken your father's herds and given them to me.
01Gn 31:10 "When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females.
01Gn 31:11 In that dream the Angel of God said to me, 'Jacob!' and I said: Here I am.
01Gn 31:12 And He said, 'Look up and see: all the males that are mating with the flocks are streaked, spotted, and speckled, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
01Gn 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you poured oil on the stone marker and made a solemn vow to Me. Get up, leave this land, and return to your native land.'"
01Gn 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah answered him, "Do we have any portion or inheritance in our father's household?
01Gn 31:15 Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? For he has sold us and has certainly spent our money.
01Gn 31:16 In fact, all the wealth that God has taken from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has said to you."
01Gn 31:17 Then Jacob got up and put his children and wives on the camels.
01Gn 31:18 He took all the livestock and possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, and he drove his herds to go to the land of his father Isaac in Canaan.
01Gn 31:19 When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household idols.
01Gn 31:20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean, not telling him that he was fleeing.
01Gn 31:21 He fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:22 On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
01Gn 31:23 So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him at Mount Gilead.
01Gn 31:24 But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night. "Watch yourself!" God warned him. "Don't say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
01Gn 31:25 When Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his brothers also pitched [their tents] in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:26 Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You have deceived me and taken my daughters away like prisoners of war!
01Gn 31:27 Why did you secretly flee from me, deceive me, and not tell me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and lyres,
01Gn 31:28 but you didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters. You have acted foolishly.
01Gn 31:29 I could do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me: 'Watch yourself. Don't say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
01Gn 31:30 Now you have gone off because you long for your father-- but why have you stolen my gods?"
01Gn 31:31 Jacob answered, "I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
01Gn 31:32 If you find your gods with anyone [here], he will not live! Before our relatives, point out anything that is yours and take it." Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen [the idols].
01Gn 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent, then Leah's tent, and then the tents of the two female slaves, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.
01Gn 31:34 Now Rachel had taken Laban's household idols, put them in the saddlebag of the camel, and sat on them. Laban searched the whole tent but found nothing.
01Gn 31:35 She said to her father, "Sir, don't be angry that I cannot stand up in your presence; I am having my monthly period." So Laban searched, but could not find the household idols.
01Gn 31:36 Then Jacob became incensed and brought charges against Laban. "What is my crime?" he said to Laban. "What is my sin, that you have pursued me?
01Gn 31:37 You've searched all my possessions! Have you found anything of yours? Put it here before my relatives and yours, and let them decide between the two of us.
01Gn 31:38 I've been with you these 20 years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams from your flock.
01Gn 31:39 I did not bring you any of the flock torn by wild beasts; I myself bore the loss. You demanded [payment] from me for what was stolen by day or by night.
01Gn 31:40 There I was-- the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
01Gn 31:41 For 20 years I have worked in your household-- 14 years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks-- and you have changed my wages 10 times!
01Gn 31:42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, certainly now you would have sent me off empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and my hard work, and He issued His verdict last night."
01Gn 31:43 Then Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters; the sons, my sons; and the flocks, my flocks! Everything you see is mine! But what can I do today for these daughters of mine or for the children they have borne?
01Gn 31:44 Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I. Let it be a witness between the two of us."
01Gn 31:45 So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a marker.
01Gn 31:46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a mound, then ate there by the mound.
01Gn 31:47 Laban named the mound Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed.
01Gn 31:48 Then Laban said, "This mound is a witness between me and you today." Therefore the place was called Galeed,
01Gn 31:49 and [also] Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD watch between you and me when we are out of each other's sight.
01Gn 31:50 If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, though no one is with us, understand that God will be a witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:51 Laban also said to Jacob, "Look at this mound and the marker I have set up between you and me.
01Gn 31:52 This mound is a witness and the marker is a witness that I will not pass beyond this mound to you, and you will not pass beyond this mound and this marker to do me harm.
01Gn 31:53 The God of Abraham, and the gods of Nahor-- the gods of their father-- will judge between us." And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
01Gn 31:54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. So they ate a meal and spent the night on the mountain.
01Gn 31:55  Laban got up early in the morning, kissed his grandsons and daughters, and blessed them. Then Laban left to return home.
01Gn 32:1 Jacob went on his way, and God's angels met him.
01Gn 32:2 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's camp." So he called that place Mahanaim.
01Gn 32:3 Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
01Gn 32:4 He commanded them, "You are to say to my lord Esau, 'This is what your servant Jacob says. I have been staying with Laban and have been delayed until now.
01Gn 32:5 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves. I have sent [this message] to inform my lord, in order to seek your favor.'"
01Gn 32:6 When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau; he is coming to meet you-- and he has 400 men with him."
01Gn 32:7 Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; he divided the people with him into two camps, along with the flocks, cattle, and camels.
01Gn 32:8 He thought, "If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it, the remaining one can escape."
01Gn 32:9 Then Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said to me, 'Go back to your land and to your family, and I will cause you to prosper,'
01Gn 32:10 I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two camps.
01Gn 32:11 Please rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid of him; otherwise, he may come and attack me, the mothers, and their children.
01Gn 32:12 You have said, 'I will cause you to prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"
01Gn 32:13 He spent the night there and took part of what he had brought with him as a gift for his brother Esau:
01Gn 32:14 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,
01Gn 32:15 30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.
01Gn 32:16 He entrusted them to his slaves as separate herds and said to them, "Go on ahead of me, and leave some distance between the herds."
01Gn 32:17 And he told the first one: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who do you belong to? Where are you going? And whose [animals] are these ahead of you?'
01Gn 32:18 then tell him, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And look, he is behind us.'"
01Gn 32:19 He also told the second one, the third, and everyone who was walking behind the animals, "Say the same thing to Esau when you find him.
01Gn 32:20 You are to also say, 'Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.' " For he thought, "I want to appease Esau with the gift that is going ahead of me. After that, I can face him, and perhaps he will forgive me."
01Gn 32:21 So the gift was sent on ahead of him while he remained in the camp that night.
01Gn 32:22 During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his 11 sons, and crossed the ford of Jabbok.
01Gn 32:23 He took them and brought them across the stream, along with all his possessions.
01Gn 32:24 Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
01Gn 32:25 When the man saw that He could not defeat him, He struck Jacob's hip as they wrestled and dislocated his hip socket.
01Gn 32:26 Then He said to Jacob, "Let Me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob said, "I will not let You go unless You bless me."
01Gn 32:27 "What is your name?" the man asked. "Jacob!" he replied.
01Gn 32:28 "Your name will no longer be Jacob," He said. "It will be Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed."
01Gn 32:29 Then Jacob asked Him, "Please tell me Your name." But He answered, "Why do you ask My name?" And He blessed him there.
01Gn 32:30 Jacob then named the place Peniel, "For," [he said,] "I have seen God face to face, and I have been delivered."
01Gn 32:31 The sun shone on him as he passed by Penuel-- limping on his hip.
01Gn 32:32 That is why, to this day, the Israelites don't eat the thigh muscle that is at the hip socket: because He struck Jacob's hip socket at the thigh muscle.
01Gn 33:1 Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female slaves.
01Gn 33:2 He put the female slaves first, Leah and her sons next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
01Gn 33:3 He himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times until he approached his brother.
01Gn 33:4 But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. Then they wept.
01Gn 33:5 When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, "Who are these with you?" He answered, "The children God has graciously given your servant."
01Gn 33:6 Then the female slaves and their children approached [him] and bowed down.
01Gn 33:7 Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.
01Gn 33:8 So Esau said, "What do you mean by this whole procession I met?" "To find favor with you, my lord," he answered.
01Gn 33:9 "I have enough, my brother," Esau replied. "Keep what you have."
01Gn 33:10 But Jacob said, "No, please! If I have found favor with you, take this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, [and it is] like seeing God's face, since you have accepted me.
01Gn 33:11 Please take my present that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have everything I need." So Jacob urged him until he accepted.
01Gn 33:12 Then Esau said, "Let's move on, and I'll go ahead of you."
01Gn 33:13 Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are weak, and I have nursing sheep and cattle. If they are driven hard for one day, the whole herd will die.
01Gn 33:14 Let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a pace suited to the livestock and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir."
01Gn 33:15 Esau said, "Let me leave some of my people with you." But he replied, "Why do that? Please indulge me, my lord."
01Gn 33:16 On that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,
01Gn 33:17 but Jacob went on to Succoth. He built a house for himself and stalls for his cattle; that is why the place was called Succoth.
01Gn 33:18 After Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at the Canaanite city of Shechem and camped in front of the city.
01Gn 33:19 He purchased a section of the field from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for 100 qesitahs, where he had pitched his tent.
01Gn 33:20 And he set up an altar there and called it "God, the God of Israel."
01Gn 34:1 Dinah, Leah's daughter whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see some of the young women of the area.
01Gn 34:2 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the region, saw her, he took her and raped her.
01Gn 34:3 He became infatuated with Dinah, daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke tenderly to her.
01Gn 34:4 "Get me this girl as a wife," he told his father Hamor.
01Gn 34:5 Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his cattle in the field, he remained silent until they returned.
01Gn 34:6 Meanwhile, Shechem's father Hamor came to speak with Jacob.
01Gn 34:7 Jacob's sons returned from the field when they heard [about the incident] and were deeply grieved and angry. For Shechem had committed an outrage against Israel by sleeping with Jacob's daughter, and such a thing should not be done.
01Gn 34:8 Hamor said to Jacob's sons, "My son Shechem is strongly attracted to your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
01Gn 34:9 Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
01Gn 34:10 Live with us. The land is before you. Settle here, move about, and acquire property in it."
01Gn 34:11 Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Grant me this favor, and I'll give you whatever you say.
01Gn 34:12 Set for me the compensation and the gift; I'll give you whatever you ask me. Just give the girl to be my wife!"
01Gn 34:13 But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
01Gn 34:14 "We cannot do this thing," they said to them. "Giving our sister to an uncircumcised man is a disgrace to us.
01Gn 34:15 We will agree with you only on this condition: if all your males are circumcised as we are.
01Gn 34:16 Then we will give you our daughters, take your daughters for ourselves, live with you, and become one people.
01Gn 34:17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."
01Gn 34:18 Their words seemed good in the eyes of Hamor and his son Shechem.
01Gn 34:19 The young man did not delay doing this, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most important in all his father's house.
01Gn 34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men there.
01Gn 34:21 "These men are peaceful toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and move about in it, for indeed, the region is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as our wives and give our daughters to them.
01Gn 34:22 But the men will agree to live with us and be one people only on this condition: if all our men are circumcised as they are.
01Gn 34:23 Won't their herds, their possessions, and all their livestock become ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live with us."
01Gn 34:24 All the able-bodied men listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and all the able-bodied men were circumcised.
01Gn 34:25 On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and killed every male.
01Gn 34:26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah from Shechem's house, and went away.
01Gn 34:27 Jacob's [other] sons came to the slaughter and plundered the city because their sister had been defiled.
01Gn 34:28 They took their sheep, cattle, donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
01Gn 34:29 They captured all their possessions, children, and wives, and plundered everything in the houses.
01Gn 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me, making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed."
01Gn 34:31 But they answered, "Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?"
01Gn 35:1 God said to Jacob, "Get up! Go to Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
01Gn 35:2 So Jacob said to his family and all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your clothes.
01Gn 35:3 We must get up and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me everywhere I have gone."
01Gn 35:4 Then they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and their earrings, and Jacob hid them under the oak near Shechem.
01Gn 35:5 When they set out, a terror from God came over the cities around them, and they did not pursue Jacob's sons.
01Gn 35:6 So Jacob and all who were with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 35:7 Jacob built an altar there and called the place God of Bethel because it was there that God had revealed Himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
01Gn 35:8 Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak south of Bethel. So Jacob named it Oak of Weeping.
01Gn 35:9 God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.
01Gn 35:10 God said to him: Your name is Jacob; you will no longer be named Jacob, but Israel will be your name. So He named him Israel.
01Gn 35:11 God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation, indeed an assembly of nations, will come from you, and kings will descend from you.
01Gn 35:12 The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. And I will give the land to your descendants after you.
01Gn 35:13 Then God withdrew from him at the place where He had spoken to him.
01Gn 35:14 Jacob set up a marker at the place where He had spoken to him-- a stone marker. He poured a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.
01Gn 35:15 Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
01Gn 35:16 They set out from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult.
01Gn 35:17 During her difficult labor, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for this is another son for you."
01Gn 35:18 With her last breath-- for she was dying-- she named him Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.
01Gn 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 35:20 Jacob set up a marker on her grave; it is the marker at Rachel's grave to this day.
01Gn 35:21 Israel set out again and pitched his tent beyond the tower at Eder.
01Gn 35:22 While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had 12 sons:
01Gn 35:23 Leah's sons were Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
01Gn 35:24 Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 35:25 The sons of Rachel's slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
01Gn 35:26 The sons of Leah's slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
01Gn 35:27 Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
01Gn 35:28 Isaac lived 180 years.
01Gn 35:29 He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
01Gn 36:1 These are the family records of Esau (that is, Edom).
01Gn 36:2 Esau took his wives from the Canaanite women: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
01Gn 36:3 and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,
01Gn 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were Esau's sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 36:6 Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, and all the people of his household, as well as his herds, all his livestock, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan; he went to a land away from his brother Jacob.
01Gn 36:7 For their possessions were too many [for them] to live together, and because of their herds, the land where they stayed could not support them.
01Gn 36:8 So Esau (that is, Edom) lived in the mountains of Seir.
01Gn 36:9 These are the family records of Esau, father of the Edomites in the mountains of Seir.
01Gn 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel son of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
01Gn 36:12 Timna, a concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Esau's wife Adah.
01Gn 36:13 These are Reuel's sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:14 These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon: She bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah to Edom.
01Gn 36:15 These are the chiefs of Esau's sons: the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
01Gn 36:16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah.
01Gn 36:17 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:18 These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs of Esau's wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:19 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
01Gn 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
01Gn 36:22 The sons of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Timna was Lotan's sister.
01Gn 36:23 These are Shobal's sons: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
01Gn 36:24 These are Zibeon's sons: Aiah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness while he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
01Gn 36:25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:26 These are Dishon's sons: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
01Gn 36:27 These are Ezer's sons: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
01Gn 36:28 These are Dishan's sons: Uz and Aran.
01Gn 36:29 These are the chiefs of the Horites: Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
01Gn 36:31 These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites:
01Gn 36:32 Bela son of Beor ruled in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah.
01Gn 36:33 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:34 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:35 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad ruled in his place. He defeated Midian in the field of Moab; the name of his city was Avith.
01Gn 36:36 When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:37 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth-on-the-River ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:39 When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar ruled in his place. His city was Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred daughter of Me-zahab.
01Gn 36:40 These are the names of Esau's chiefs, according to their families and their localities, by their names: Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01Gn 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01Gn 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01Gn 36:43 Magdiel, and Iram. These are Edom's chiefs, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. Esau was father of the Edomites.
01Gn 37:1 Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
01Gn 37:2 These are the family records of Jacob. At 17 years of age, Joseph tended sheep with his brothers. The young man [was working] with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought a bad report about them to their father.
01Gn 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because Joseph was a son [born to him] in his old age, and he made a robe of many colors for him.
01Gn 37:4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him.
01Gn 37:5 Then Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
01Gn 37:6 He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:
01Gn 37:7 There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my sheaf stood up, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."
01Gn 37:8 "Are you really going to reign over us?" his brothers asked him. "Are you really going to rule us?" So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said.
01Gn 37:9 Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. "Look," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun, moon, and 11 stars were bowing down to me."
01Gn 37:10 He told his father and brothers, but his father rebuked him. "What kind of dream is this that you have had?" he said. "Are your mother and brothers and I going to bow down to the ground before you?"
01Gn 37:11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter [in mind].
01Gn 37:12 His brothers had gone to pasture their father's flocks at Shechem.
01Gn 37:13 Israel said to Joseph, "Your brothers, you know, are pasturing [the flocks] at Shechem. Get ready. I'm sending you to them." "I'm ready," Joseph replied.
01Gn 37:14 Then Israel said to him, "Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing, and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem.
01Gn 37:15 A man found him there, wandering in the field, and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
01Gn 37:16 "I'm looking for my brothers," Joseph said. "Can you tell me where they are pasturing [their flocks]?"
01Gn 37:17 "They've moved on from here," the man said. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.' " So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
01Gn 37:18 They saw him in the distance, and before he had reached them, they plotted to kill him.
01Gn 37:19 They said to one another, "Here comes that dreamer!
01Gn 37:20 Come on, let's kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal ate him. Then we'll see what becomes of his dreams!"
01Gn 37:21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him from them. He said, "Let's not take his life."
01Gn 37:22 Reuben also said to them, "Don't shed blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him"-- intending to rescue him from their hands and return him to his father.
01Gn 37:23 When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped off his robe, the robe of many colors that he had on.
01Gn 37:24 Then they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
01Gn 37:25 Then they sat down to eat a meal. They looked up, and there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying aromatic gum, balsam, and resin, going down to Egypt.
01Gn 37:26 Then Judah said to his brothers, "What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
01Gn 37:27 Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our [own] flesh." His brothers agreed.
01Gn 37:28 When Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for 20 pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took Joseph to Egypt.
01Gn 37:29 When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
01Gn 37:30 He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone! What am I going to do?"
01Gn 37:31 So they took Joseph's robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.
01Gn 37:32 They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it. Is it your son's robe or not?"
01Gn 37:33 His father recognized it. "It is my son's robe," he said. "A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has been torn to pieces!"
01Gn 37:34 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days.
01Gn 37:35 All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said. "I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." And his father wept for him.
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard.
01Gn 38:1 At that time Judah left his brothers and settled near an Adullamite named Hirah.
01Gn 38:2 There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua; he took her as a wife and slept with her.
01Gn 38:3 She conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er.
01Gn 38:4 She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Onan.
01Gn 38:5 She gave birth to another son and named him Shelah. It was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.
01Gn 38:6 Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
01Gn 38:7 Now Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the LORD's sight, and the LORD put him to death.
01Gn 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Sleep with your brother's wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law and produce offspring for your brother."
01Gn 38:9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother's wife, he released his semen on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother.
01Gn 38:10 What he did was evil in the LORD's sight, so He put him to death also.
01Gn 38:11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He might die too, like his brother." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
01Gn 38:12 After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah to the sheepshearers.
01Gn 38:13 Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
01Gn 38:14 So she took off her widow's clothes, veiled [her face], covered herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife.
01Gn 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
01Gn 38:16 He went over to her and said, "Come, let me sleep with you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me for sleeping with me?"
01Gn 38:17 "I will send you a young goat from my flock," he replied. But she said, "Only if you leave something [with me] until you send it."
01Gn 38:18 "What should I give you?" he asked. She answered, "Your signet ring, your cord, and the staff in your hand." So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she got pregnant by him.
01Gn 38:19 She got up and left, then removed her veil and put her widow's clothes back on.
01Gn 38:20 When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get back the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her.
01Gn 38:21 He asked the men of the place, "Where is the cult prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" "There has been no cult prostitute here," they answered.
01Gn 38:22 So the Adullamite returned to Judah, saying, "I couldn't find her, and furthermore, the men of the place said, 'There has been no cult prostitute here.'"
01Gn 38:23 Judah replied, "Let her keep [the items] for herself; otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send this young goat, but you couldn't find [her]."
01Gn 38:24 About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law has been acting like a prostitute, and now she is pregnant." "Bring her out!" Judah said. "Let her be burned [to death]!"
01Gn 38:25 As she was being brought out, she sent her father-in-law [this message]: "I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong." And she added, "Examine them. Whose signet ring, cord, and staff are these?"
01Gn 38:26 Judah recognized [them] and said, "She is more in the right than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not know her intimately again.
01Gn 38:27 When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
01Gn 38:28 As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand, and the midwife took it and tied a scarlet [thread] around it, announcing, "This one came out first."
01Gn 38:29 But then he pulled his hand back, and his brother came out. Then she said, "You have broken out [first]!" So he was named Perez.
01Gn 38:30 Then his brother, who had the scarlet [thread] tied to his hand, came out, and was named Zerah.
01Gn 39:1 Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt. An Egyptian [named] Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.
01Gn 39:2 The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master.
01Gn 39:3 When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD made everything he did successful,
01Gn 39:4 Joseph found favor in his master's sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar also put him in charge of his household and placed all that he owned under his authority.
01Gn 39:5 From the time that he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house because of Joseph. The LORD's blessing was on all that he owned, in his house and in his fields.
01Gn 39:6 He left all that he owned under Joseph's authority; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.
01Gn 39:7 After some time his master's wife looked longingly at Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."
01Gn 39:8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Look, my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has put all that he owns under my authority.
01Gn 39:9 No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?"
01Gn 39:10 Although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her.
01Gn 39:11 Now one day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants was there.
01Gn 39:12 She grabbed him by his garment and said, "Sleep with me!" But leaving his garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside.
01Gn 39:13 When she realized that he had left his garment with her and had run outside,
01Gn 39:14 she called the household servants. "Look," she said to them, "my husband brought a Hebrew man to us to make fun of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, and I screamed as loud as I could.
01Gn 39:15 When he heard me screaming for help, he left his garment with me and ran outside."
01Gn 39:16 She put Joseph's garment beside her until his master came home.
01Gn 39:17 Then she told him the same story: "The Hebrew slave you brought to us came to me to make fun of me,
01Gn 39:18 but when I screamed for help, he left his garment with me and ran outside."
01Gn 39:19 When his master heard the story his wife told him-- "These are the things your slave did to me"-- he was furious
01Gn 39:20 and had him thrown into prison, where the king's prisoners were confined. So Joseph was there in prison.
01Gn 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him. He granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
01Gn 39:22 The warden put all the prisoners who were in the prison under Joseph's authority, and he was responsible for everything that was done there.
01Gn 39:23 The warden did not bother with anything under Joseph's authority, because the LORD was with him, and the LORD made everything that he did successful.
01Gn 40:1 After this, the king of Egypt's cupbearer and his baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
01Gn 40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
01Gn 40:3 and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
01Gn 40:4 The captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he became their personal attendant. And they were in custody for some time.
01Gn 40:5 The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream. Both had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught.
01Gn 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why are your faces sad today?"
01Gn 40:8 "We had dreams," they said to him, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Tell me [your dreams]."
01Gn 40:9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: "In my dream there was a vine in front of me.
01Gn 40:10 On the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and its clusters ripened into grapes.
01Gn 40:11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
01Gn 40:12 "This is its interpretation," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days.
01Gn 40:13 In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand the way you used to when you were his cupbearer.
01Gn 40:14 But when all goes well for you, remember that I was with you. Please show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison.
01Gn 40:15 For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon."
01Gn 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was positive, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream. Three baskets of white bread were on my head.
01Gn 40:17 In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
01Gn 40:18 "This is its interpretation," Joseph replied. "The three baskets are three days.
01Gn 40:19 In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head-- from off you-- and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh from your body."
01Gn 40:20 On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he gave a feast for all his servants. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker:
01Gn 40:21 he restored the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;
01Gn 40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had explained to them.
01Gn 40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
01Gn 41:1 Two years later Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile,
01Gn 41:2 when seven healthy-looking, well-fed cows came up from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds.
01Gn 41:3 After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside those cows along the bank of the Nile.
01Gn 41:4 The sickly, thin cows ate the healthy, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
01Gn 41:5 He fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, full and good, came up on one stalk.
01Gn 41:6 After them, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up.
01Gn 41:7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven full, good ones. Then Pharaoh woke up, and it was only a dream.
01Gn 41:8 When morning came, he was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
01Gn 41:9 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I remember my faults.
01Gn 41:10 Pharaoh had been angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard.
01Gn 41:11 He and I had dreams on the same night; each dream had its own meaning.
01Gn 41:12 Now a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guards, was with us there. We told him our dreams, he interpreted our dreams for us, and each had its own interpretation.
01Gn 41:13 It turned out just the way he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged."
01Gn 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they quickly brought him from the dungeon. He shaved, changed his clothes, and went to Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it."
01Gn 41:16 "I am not able to," Joseph answered Pharaoh. "It is God who will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
01Gn 41:17 So Pharaoh said to Joseph: "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
01Gn 41:18 when seven well-fed, healthy-looking cows came up from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds.
01Gn 41:19 After them, seven other cows-- ugly, very sickly, and thin-- came up. I've never seen such ugly ones as these in all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:20 Then the thin, ugly cows ate the first seven well-fed cows.
01Gn 41:21 When they had devoured them, you could not tell that they had devoured them; their appearance was as bad as it had been before. Then I woke up.
01Gn 41:22 In my dream I had also seen seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stalk.
01Gn 41:23 After them, seven heads of grain-- withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind-- sprouted up.
01Gn 41:24 The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven full ones. I told this to the magicians, but no one can tell me what it means."
01Gn 41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams mean the same thing. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
01Gn 41:26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years. The dreams mean the same thing.
01Gn 41:27 The seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven worthless, scorched heads of grain are seven years of famine.
01Gn 41:28 "It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
01Gn 41:29 Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:30 After them, seven years of famine will take place, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will devastate the land.
01Gn 41:31 The abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows it, for the famine will be very severe.
01Gn 41:32 Because the dream was given twice to Pharaoh, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and He will soon carry it out.
01Gn 41:33 "So now, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:34 Let Pharaoh do this: Let him appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth [of the harvest] of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
01Gn 41:35 Let them gather all the [excess] food during these good years that are coming, store the grain under Pharaoh's authority as food in the cities, and preserve [it].
01Gn 41:36 The food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine that will take place in the land of Egypt. Then the country will not be wiped out by the famine."
01Gn 41:37 The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
01Gn 41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find anyone like this, a man who has the spirit of God in him?"
01Gn 41:39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as intelligent and wise as you.
01Gn 41:40 You will be over my house, and all my people will obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you."
01Gn 41:41 Pharaoh also said to Joseph, "See, I am placing you over all the land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:42 Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
01Gn 41:43 He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, and [servants] called out before him, "Abrek!" So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:44 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your permission no one will be able to raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:45 Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him a wife, Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:46 Joseph was 30 years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph left Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:47 During the seven years of abundance the land produced outstanding harvests.
01Gn 41:48 Joseph gathered all the [excess] food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and placed it in the cities. He placed the food in every city from the fields around it.
01Gn 41:49 So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance-- like the sand of the sea-- that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.
01Gn 41:50 Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived. Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On, bore [them] to him.
01Gn 41:51 Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, meaning, "God has made me forget all my hardship in my father's house."
01Gn 41:52 And the second son he named Ephraim, meaning, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
01Gn 41:53 Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,
01Gn 41:54 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every country, but throughout the land of Egypt there was food.
01Gn 41:55 Extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh told all Egypt, "Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you."
01Gn 41:56 Because the famine had spread across the whole country, Joseph opened up [all the storehouses] and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:57 The whole world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe all over the earth.
01Gn 42:1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you keep looking at each other?
01Gn 42:2 Listen," he went on, "I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us so that we will live and not die."
01Gn 42:3 So 10 of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
01Gn 42:4 But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, "Something might happen to him."
01Gn 42:5 The sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 42:6 Joseph was in charge of the country; he sold grain to all its people. His brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
01Gn 42:7 When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan to buy food," they replied.
01Gn 42:8 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
01Gn 42:9 Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies. You have come to see the weakness of the land."
01Gn 42:10 "No, my lord. Your servants have come to buy food," they said.
01Gn 42:11 "We are all sons of one man. We are honest; your servants are not spies."
01Gn 42:12 "No," he said to them. "You have come to see the weakness of the land."
01Gn 42:13 But they replied, "We, your servants, were 12 brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no longer living."
01Gn 42:14 Then Joseph said to them, "I have spoken: 'You are spies!'
01Gn 42:15 This is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
01Gn 42:16 Send one of your number to get your brother. The rest of you will be imprisoned so that your words can be tested to see if they are true. If they are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"
01Gn 42:17 So Joseph imprisoned them together for three days.
01Gn 42:18 On the third day Joseph said to them, "I fear God-- do this and you will live.
01Gn 42:19 If you are honest men, let one of you be confined to the guardhouse, while the rest of you go and take grain [to relieve] the hunger of your households.
01Gn 42:20 Bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be confirmed; then you won't die." And they consented to this.
01Gn 42:21 Then they said to each other, "It is plain that we are being punished for what we did to our brother. We saw his deep distress when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this trouble has come to us."
01Gn 42:22 But Reuben replied: "Didn't I tell you not to harm the boy? But you wouldn't listen. Now we must account for his blood!"
01Gn 42:23 They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them.
01Gn 42:24 He turned away from them and wept. Then he turned back and spoke to them. He took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.
01Gn 42:25 Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man's money to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out.
01Gn 42:26 They loaded the grain on their donkeys and left there.
01Gn 42:27 At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his money there at the top of the bag.
01Gn 42:28 He said to his brothers, "My money has been returned! It's here in my bag." Their hearts sank. Trembling, they turned to one another and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"
01Gn 42:29 When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them:
01Gn 42:30 "The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
01Gn 42:31 But we told him: We are honest men and not spies.
01Gn 42:32 We were 12 brothers, sons of the same father. One is no longer living, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 42:33 The man who is the lord of the country said to us, 'This is how I will know if you are honest men: Leave one brother with me, take [food to relieve] the hunger of your households, and go.
01Gn 42:34 Bring back your youngest brother to me, and I will know that you are not spies but honest men. I will then give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the country.'"
01Gn 42:35 As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his bag of money! When they and their father saw their bags of money, they were afraid.
01Gn 42:36 Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is gone. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything happens to me!"
01Gn 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, "You can kill my two sons if I don't bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him to you."
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob answered, "My son will not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If anything happens to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow."
01Gn 43:1 Now the famine in the land was severe.
01Gn 43:2 When they had used up the grain they had brought back from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us some food."
01Gn 43:3 But Judah said to him, "The man specifically warned us: 'You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.'
01Gn 43:4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
01Gn 43:5 But if you will not send him, we will not go, for the man said to us, 'You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.'"
01Gn 43:6 "Why did you cause me so much trouble?" Israel asked. "Why did you tell the man that you had another brother?"
01Gn 43:7 They answered, "The man kept asking about us and our family: 'Is your father still alive? Do you have [another] brother?' And we answered him accordingly. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring your brother here'?"
01Gn 43:8 Then Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the boy with me. We will be on our way so that we may live, and not die-- neither we, nor you, nor our children.
01Gn 43:9 I will be responsible for him. You can hold me personally accountable! If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, I will be guilty before you forever.
01Gn 43:10 If we had not wasted time, we could have come back twice by now."
01Gn 43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and take them down to the man as a gift-- some balsam and some honey, aromatic gum and resin, pistachios and almonds.
01Gn 43:12 Take twice as much money with you. Return the money that was returned [to you] in the top of your bags. Perhaps it was a mistake.
01Gn 43:13 Take your brother also, and go back at once to the man.
01Gn 43:14 May God Almighty cause the man to be merciful to you so that he will release your other brother and Benjamin to you. As for me, if I am deprived of my sons, then I am deprived."
01Gn 43:15 The men took this gift, double the amount of money, and Benjamin. They made their way down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
01Gn 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his steward, "Take the men to [my] house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they will eat with me at noon."
01Gn 43:17 The man did as Joseph had said and brought them to Joseph's house.
01Gn 43:18 But the men were afraid because they were taken to Joseph's house. They said, "We have been brought here because of the money that was returned in our bags the first time. They intend to overpower us, seize us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys."
01Gn 43:19 So they approached Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the doorway of the house.
01Gn 43:20 They said, "Sir, we really did come down here the first time only to buy food.
01Gn 43:21 When we came to the place where we lodged for the night and opened our bags of grain, each one's money was at the top of his bag! It was the full amount of our money, and we have brought it back with us.
01Gn 43:22 We have brought additional money with us to buy food. We don't know who put our money in the bags."
01Gn 43:23 Then the steward said, "May you be well. Don't be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags. I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
01Gn 43:24 The man brought the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet, and got feed for their donkeys.
01Gn 43:25 Since the men had heard that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph's arrival at noon.
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift they had carried into the house, and they bowed to the ground before him.
01Gn 43:27 He asked if they were well, and he said, "How is your elderly father that you told me about? Is he still alive?"
01Gn 43:28 They answered, "Your servant our father is well. He is still alive." And they bowed down to honor him.
01Gn 43:29 When he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother that you told me about?" Then he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."
01Gn 43:30 Joseph hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he was about to weep. He went into an inner room to weep.
01Gn 43:31 Then he washed his face and came out. Regaining his composure, he said, "Serve the meal."
01Gn 43:32 They served him by himself, his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, since that is abhorrent to them.
01Gn 43:33 They were seated before him in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment.
01Gn 43:34 Portions were served to them from Joseph's table, and Benjamin's portion was five times larger than any of theirs. They drank, and they got drunk with Joseph.
01Gn 44:1 Then Joseph commanded his steward: "Fill the men's bags with as much food as they can carry, and put each one's money at the top of his bag.
01Gn 44:2 Put my cup, the silver one, at the top of the youngest one's bag, along with his grain money." So he did as Joseph told him.
01Gn 44:3 At morning light, the men were sent off with their donkeys.
01Gn 44:4 They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Get up. Pursue the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
01Gn 44:5 Isn't this the cup that my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wrong!'"
01Gn 44:6 When he overtook them, he said these words to them.
01Gn 44:7 They said to him, "Why does my lord say these things? Your servants could not possibly do such a thing.
01Gn 44:8 We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found at the top of our bags. How could we steal gold and silver from your master's house?
01Gn 44:9 If any of us is found to have it, he must die, and we also will become my lord's slaves."
01Gn 44:10 The steward replied, "What you have said is proper, but only the one who is found to have it will be my slave, and the rest of you will be blameless."
01Gn 44:11 So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
01Gn 44:12 The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
01Gn 44:13 Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and returned to the city.
01Gn 44:14 When Judah and his brothers reached Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him.
01Gn 44:15 "What is this you have done?" Joseph said to them. "Didn't you know that a man like me could uncover the truth by divination?"
01Gn 44:16 "What can we say to my lord?" Judah replied. "How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed your servants' iniquity. We are now my lord's slaves-- both we and the one in whose possession the cup was found."
01Gn 44:17 Then Joseph said, "I swear that I will not do this. The man in whose possession the cup was found will be my slave. The rest of you can go in peace to your father."
01Gn 44:18 But Judah approached him and said, "Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh.
01Gn 44:19 My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
01Gn 44:20 and we answered my lord, 'We have an elderly father and a young brother, the child of his old age. The boy's brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.'
01Gn 44:21 Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him to me so that I can see him.'
01Gn 44:22 But we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.'
01Gn 44:23 Then you said to your servants, 'If your younger brother does not come down with you, you will not see me again.'
01Gn 44:24 "This is what happened when we went back to your servant my father: We reported your words to him.
01Gn 44:25 But our father said, 'Go again, and buy us some food.'
01Gn 44:26 We told him, 'We cannot go down unless our younger brother goes with us. But if our younger brother isn't with us, we cannot see the man.'
01Gn 44:27 Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
01Gn 44:28 One left-- I said that he must have been torn to pieces-- and I have never seen him again.
01Gn 44:29 If you also take this one from me and anything happens to him, you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow.'
01Gn 44:30 "So, if I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us-- his life is wrapped up with the boy's life--
01Gn 44:31 when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hairs of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
01Gn 44:32 Your servant became accountable to my father for the boy, saying, 'If I do not return him to you, I will always bear the guilt for sinning against [you,] my father.'
01Gn 44:33 Now please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave, in place of the boy. Let him go back with his brothers.
01Gn 44:34 For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the grief that would overwhelm my father."
01Gn 45:1 Joseph could no longer keep his composure in front of all his attendants, so he called out, "Send everyone away from me!" No one was with him when he revealed his identity to his brothers.
01Gn 45:2 But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and also Pharaoh's household heard it.
01Gn 45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were too terrified to answer him.
01Gn 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Please, come near me," and they came near. "I am Joseph, your brother," he said, "the one you sold into Egypt.
01Gn 45:5 And now don't be worried or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to preserve life.
01Gn 45:6 For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting.
01Gn 45:7 God sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
01Gn 45:8 Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 45:9 "Return quickly to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay.
01Gn 45:10 You can settle in the land of Goshen and be near me-- you, your children, and grandchildren, your sheep, cattle, and all you have.
01Gn 45:11 There I will sustain you, for there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you, your household, and everything you have will become destitute."'
01Gn 45:12 Look! Your eyes and my brother Benjamin's eyes can see that it is I [, Joseph,] who am speaking to you.
01Gn 45:13 Tell my father all about my glory in Egypt and about all you have seen. And bring my father here quickly."
01Gn 45:14 Then Joseph threw his arms around Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder.
01Gn 45:15 Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
01Gn 45:16 When the news reached Pharaoh's house, "Joseph's brothers have come," Pharaoh and his servants were pleased.
01Gn 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and go on back to the land of Canaan.
01Gn 45:18 Get your father and your households, and come back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you can eat from the richness of the land.'
01Gn 45:19 You are also commanded, 'Do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children, your wives, and bring your father here.
01Gn 45:20 Do not be concerned about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
01Gn 45:21 The sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had commanded, and he gave them provisions for the journey.
01Gn 45:22 He gave each of the brothers changes of clothes, but he gave Benjamin 300 pieces of silver and five changes of clothes.
01Gn 45:23 He sent his father the following: 10 donkeys carrying the best products of Egypt, and 10 female donkeys carrying grain, food, and provisions for his father on the journey.
01Gn 45:24 So Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, "Don't argue on the way."
01Gn 45:25 So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 45:26 They said, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!" Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them.
01Gn 45:27 But when they told Jacob all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
01Gn 45:28 Then Israel said, "Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go to see him before I die."
01Gn 46:1 Israel set out with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba, and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
01Gn 46:2 That night God spoke to Israel in a vision: "Jacob, Jacob!" He said. And Jacob replied, "Here I am."
01Gn 46:3 God said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there.
01Gn 46:4 I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back. Joseph will put his hands on your eyes."
01Gn 46:5 Jacob left Beer-sheba. The sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him, along with their children and their wives.
01Gn 46:6 They also took their cattle and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Then Jacob and all his children with him went to Egypt.
01Gn 46:7 His sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters, indeed all his offspring, he brought with him to Egypt.
01Gn 46:8 These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his descendants, who went to Egypt: Jacob's firstborn: Reuben.
01Gn 46:9 Reuben's sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
01Gn 46:10 Simeon's sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
01Gn 46:11 Levi's sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
01Gn 46:12 Judah's sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. Perez's sons: Hezron and Hamul.
01Gn 46:13 Issachar's sons: Tola, Puvah, Jashub, and Shimron.
01Gn 46:14 Zebulun's sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
01Gn 46:15 These were Leah's sons born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, as well as his daughter Dinah. The total number of persons: 33.
01Gn 46:16 Gad's sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
01Gn 46:17 Asher's sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel.
01Gn 46:18 These were the sons of Zilpah-- whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah-- that she bore to Jacob: 16 persons.
01Gn 46:19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 46:20 Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. They were born to him by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, a priest at On.
01Gn 46:21 Benjamin's sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
01Gn 46:22 These were Rachel's sons who were born to Jacob: 14 persons.
01Gn 46:23 Dan's son: Hashum.
01Gn 46:24 Naphtali's sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
01Gn 46:25 These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore to Jacob: seven persons.
01Gn 46:26 The total number of persons belonging to Jacob-- his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob's sons-- who came to Egypt: 66.
01Gn 46:27 And Joseph's sons who were born to him in Egypt: two persons. All those of Jacob's household who had come to Egypt: 70 persons.
01Gn 46:28 Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to prepare for his arrival at Goshen. When they came to the land of Goshen,
01Gn 46:29 Joseph hitched [the horses to] his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, threw his arms around him, and wept for a long time.
01Gn 46:30 Then Israel said to Joseph, "At last I can die, now that I have seen your face [and know] you are still alive!"
01Gn 46:31 Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and inform Pharaoh, telling him: My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
01Gn 46:32 The men are shepherds; indeed they raise livestock. They have brought their sheep and cattle and all that they have.
01Gn 46:33 When Pharaoh addresses you and asks, 'What is your occupation?'
01Gn 46:34 you are to say, 'Your servants, both we and our fathers, have raised livestock from our youth until now.' Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen, since all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians."
01Gn 47:1 So Joseph went and informed Pharaoh: "My father and my brothers, with their sheep and cattle and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the land of Goshen."
01Gn 47:2 He took five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:3 Then Pharaoh asked his brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants, both we and our fathers, are shepherds."
01Gn 47:4 Then they said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live in the land for a while because there is no grazing land for your servants' sheep, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please let your servants settle in the land of Goshen."
01Gn 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "[Now that] your father and brothers have come to you,
01Gn 47:6 the land of Egypt is open before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They can live in the land of Goshen. If you know of any capable men among them, put them in charge of my livestock."
01Gn 47:7 Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:8 Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many years have you lived?"
01Gn 47:9 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "My pilgrimage has lasted 130 years. My years have been few and hard, and they have not surpassed the years of my fathers during their pilgrimages."
01Gn 47:10 So Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from Pharaoh's presence.
01Gn 47:11 Then Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
01Gn 47:12 And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food for their dependents.
01Gn 47:13 But there was no food in that entire region, for the famine was very severe. The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine.
01Gn 47:14 Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were purchasing, and he brought the money to Pharaoh's house.
01Gn 47:15 When the money from the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die here in front of you? The money is gone!"
01Gn 47:16 But Joseph said, "Give me your livestock. Since the money is gone, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock."
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses, the herds of sheep, the herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
01Gn 47:18 When that year was over, they came the next year and said to him, "We cannot hide from our lord that the money is gone and that all our livestock belongs to our lord. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
01Gn 47:19 Why should we perish here in front of you-- both us and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food. Then we with our land will become Pharaoh's slaves. Give us seed so that we can live and not die, and so that the land won't become desolate."
01Gn 47:20 In this way, Joseph acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, because every Egyptian sold his field since the famine was so severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's,
01Gn 47:21 and Joseph moved the people to the cities from one end of Egypt to the other.
01Gn 47:22 The only land he didn't acquire was that of the priests, for it was their allotment from Pharaoh. They lived off the allotment Pharaoh had given them; therefore they did not sell their land.
01Gn 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Understand today that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you. Sow it in the land.
01Gn 47:24 At harvest, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and as food for yourselves, your households, and your dependents."
01Gn 47:25 And they said, "You have saved our lives. We have found favor in our lord's eyes and will be Pharaoh's slaves."
01Gn 47:26 So Joseph made it a law, still in effect today in the land of Egypt, that a fifth [of the produce] belongs to Pharaoh. Only the priests' land does not belong to Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:27 Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property in it and became fruitful and very numerous.
01Gn 47:28 Now Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years, and his life span was 147 years.
01Gn 47:29 When the time drew near for him to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh [and promise me] that you will deal with me in faithful love. Do not bury me in Egypt.
01Gn 47:30 When I lie down with my fathers, carry me away from Egypt and bury me in their burial place." Joseph answered, "I will do what you have asked."
01Gn 47:31 And Jacob said, "Swear to me." So Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed [in thanks] at the head of his bed.
01Gn 48:1 Some time after this, Joseph was told, "Your father is weaker." So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
01Gn 48:2 When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
01Gn 48:3 Jacob said to Joseph, " God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.
01Gn 48:4 He said to me, 'I will make you fruitful and numerous; I will make many nations [come from] you, and I will give this land as an eternal possession to your descendants to come.'
01Gn 48:5 Your two sons born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are now mine. Ephraim and Manasseh belong to me just as Reuben and Simeon do.
01Gn 48:6 Children born to you after them will be yours and will be recorded under the names of their brothers with regard to their inheritance.
01Gn 48:7 When I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way, some distance from Ephrath in the land of Canaan. I buried her there along the way to Ephrath," (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 48:8 When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
01Gn 48:9 And Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons God has given me here." So Jacob said, "Bring them to me and I will bless them."
01Gn 48:10 Now Jacob's eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought them to him, and he kissed and embraced them.
01Gn 48:11 Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face [again], but now God has even let me see your offspring."
01Gn 48:12 Then Joseph took them from his [father's] knees and bowed with his face to the ground.
01Gn 48:13 Then Joseph took them both-- with his right hand Ephraim toward Israel's left, and with his left hand Manasseh toward Israel's right-- and brought them to Israel.
01Gn 48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and crossing his hands, put his left on Manasseh's head, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
01Gn 48:15 Then he blessed Joseph and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
01Gn 48:16 the Angel who has redeemed me from all harm-- may He bless these boys. And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow to be numerous within the land.
01Gn 48:17 When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, he thought it was a mistake and took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's.
01Gn 48:18 Joseph said to his father, "Not that way, my father! This one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head."
01Gn 48:19 But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know! He too will become a tribe, and he too will be great; nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a populous nation."
01Gn 48:20 So he blessed them that day with these words: Israel will invoke blessings by you, saying, "May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh," putting Ephraim before Manasseh.
01Gn 48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, "Look! I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
01Gn 48:22 Over and above what I am giving your brothers, I am giving you the one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow."
01Gn 49:1 Then Jacob called his sons and said, "Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the days to come.
01Gn 49:2 Come together and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel:
01Gn 49:3 Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength and the firstfruits of my virility, excelling in prominence, excelling in power.
01Gn 49:4 Turbulent as water, you will no longer excel, because you got into your father's bed and you defiled it-- he got into my bed.
01Gn 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; their knives are vicious weapons.
01Gn 49:6 May I never enter their council; may I never join their assembly. For in their anger they kill men, and on a whim they hamstring oxen.
01Gn 49:7 Their anger is cursed, for it is strong, and their fury, for it is cruel! I will disperse them throughout Jacob and scatter them throughout Israel.
01Gn 49:8 Judah, your brothers will praise you. Your hand will be on the necks of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you.
01Gn 49:9 Judah is a young lion-- my son, you return from the kill-- he crouches; he lies down like a lion and like a lioness-- who wants to rouse him?
01Gn 49:10 The scepter will not depart from Judah, or the staff from between his feet, until He whose right it is comes and the obedience of the peoples belongs to Him.
01Gn 49:11 He ties his donkey to a vine, and the colt of his donkey to the choice vine. He washes his clothes in wine, and his robes in the blood of grapes.
01Gn 49:12 His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.
01Gn 49:13 Zebulun will live by the seashore and will be a harbor for ships, and his territory will be next to Sidon.
01Gn 49:14 Issachar is a strong donkey lying down between the saddlebags.
01Gn 49:15 He saw that his resting place was good and that the land was pleasant, so he leaned his shoulder to bear a load and became a forced laborer.
01Gn 49:16 Dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
01Gn 49:17 He will be a snake by the road, a viper beside the path, that bites the horses' heels so that its rider falls backwards.
01Gn 49:18 I wait for Your salvation, LORD.
01Gn 49:19 Gad will be attacked by [marauding] bands, but he will attack their heels.
01Gn 49:20 Asher's food will be rich, and he will produce royal delicacies.
01Gn 49:21 Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
01Gn 49:22 Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine beside a spring; its branches climb over the wall.
01Gn 49:23 The archers attacked him, shot at him, and were hostile toward him.
01Gn 49:24 Yet his bow remained steady, and his strong arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
01Gn 49:25 by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, and blessings of the breasts and the womb.
01Gn 49:26 The blessings of your father excel the blessings of my ancestors and the bounty of the eternal hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the prince of his brothers.
01Gn 49:27 Benjamin is a wolf; he tears [his prey.] In the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the plunder."
01Gn 49:28 These are the tribes of Israel, 12 in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing.
01Gn 49:29 Then he commanded them: "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
01Gn 49:30 The cave is in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
01Gn 49:31 Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there, Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried there, and I buried Leah there.
01Gn 49:32 The field and the cave in it [were purchased] from the Hittites."
01Gn 49:33 When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and died. He was gathered to his people.
01Gn 50:1 Then Joseph, leaning over his father's face, wept and kissed him.
01Gn 50:2 He commanded his servants who were physicians to embalm his father. So they embalmed Israel.
01Gn 50:3 They took 40 days to complete this, for embalming takes that long, and the Egyptians mourned for him 70 days.
01Gn 50:4 When the days of mourning were over, Joseph said to Pharaoh's household, "If I have found favor with you, please tell Pharaoh that
01Gn 50:5 my father made me take an oath, saying, 'I am about to die. You must bury me there in the tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan.' Now let me go and bury my father. Then I will return."
01Gn 50:6 So Pharaoh said, "Go and bury your father in keeping with your oath."
01Gn 50:7 Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all Pharaoh's servants, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went with him,
01Gn 50:8 along with all Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their sheep, and their cattle were left in the land of Goshen.
01Gn 50:9 Horses and chariots went up with him; it was a very impressive procession.
01Gn 50:10 When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wept loudly, and Joseph mourned seven days for his father.
01Gn 50:11 When the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians." Therefore the place is named Abel-mizraim. It is across the Jordan.
01Gn 50:12 So Jacob's sons did for him what he had commanded them.
01Gn 50:13 They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
01Gn 50:14 After Joseph buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father.
01Gn 50:15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said to one another, "If Joseph is holding a grudge against us, he will certainly repay us for all the wrong we caused him."
01Gn 50:16 So they sent this message to Joseph, "Before he died your father gave a command:
01Gn 50:17 'Say this to Joseph: Please forgive your brothers' transgression and their sin-- the wrong they caused you.' Therefore, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when their message came to him.
01Gn 50:18 Then his brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said, "We are your slaves!"
01Gn 50:19 But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
01Gn 50:20 You planned evil against me; God planned it for good to bring about the present result-- the survival of many people.
01Gn 50:21 Therefore don't be afraid. I will take care of you and your little ones." And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
01Gn 50:22 Joseph and his father's household remained in Egypt. Joseph lived 110 years.
01Gn 50:23 He saw Ephraim's sons to the third generation; the sons of Manasseh's son Machir were recognized by Joseph.
01Gn 50:24 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will certainly come to your aid and bring you up from this land to the land He promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
01Gn 50:25 So Joseph made the Israelites take an oath: "When God comes to your aid, you are to carry my bones up from here."
01Gn 50:26 Joseph died at the age of 110. They embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.
02
02Ex 1:1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his family:
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
02Ex 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
02Ex 1:4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
02Ex 1:5 The total number of Jacob's descendants was 70; Joseph was already in Egypt.
02Ex 1:6 Then Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.
02Ex 1:7 But the Israelites were fruitful, increased rapidly, multiplied, and became extremely numerous so that the land was filled with them.
02Ex 1:8 A new king, who had not known Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
02Ex 1:9 He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and powerful than we are.
02Ex 1:10 Let us deal shrewdly with them; otherwise they will multiply [further], and if war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country."
02Ex 1:11 So the Egyptians assigned taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. They built Pithom and Rameses as supply cities for Pharaoh.
02Ex 1:12 But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread so that the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
02Ex 1:13 They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
02Ex 1:14 and made their lives bitter with difficult labor in brick and mortar, and in all kinds of fieldwork. They ruthlessly imposed all this work on them.
02Ex 1:15 Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
02Ex 1:16 "When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them as they deliver. If the child is a son, kill him, but if it's a daughter, she may live."
02Ex 1:17 The Hebrew midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.
02Ex 1:18 So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this and let the boys live?"
02Ex 1:19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife can get to them."
02Ex 1:20 So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very numerous.
02Ex 1:21 Since the midwives feared God, He gave them families.
02Ex 1:22 Pharaoh then commanded all his people: "You must throw every son born to the Hebrews into the Nile, but let every daughter live."
02Ex 2:1 Now a man from the family of Levi married a Levite woman.
02Ex 2:2 The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son; when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.
02Ex 2:3 But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with asphalt and pitch. She placed the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.
02Ex 2:4 Then his sister stood at a distance in order to see what would happen to him.
02Ex 2:5 Pharaoh's daughter went down to bathe at the Nile while her servant girls walked along the riverbank. Seeing the basket among the reeds, she sent her slave girl to get it.
02Ex 2:6 When she opened it, she saw the child-- a little boy, crying. She felt sorry for him and said, "This is one of the Hebrew boys."
02Ex 2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and call a woman from the Hebrews to nurse the boy for you?"
02Ex 2:8 "Go." Pharaoh's daughter told her. So the girl went and called the boy's mother.
02Ex 2:9 Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages." So the woman took the boy and nursed him.
02Ex 2:10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, "Because," she said, "I drew him out of the water."
02Ex 2:11 Years later, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their forced labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.
02Ex 2:12 Looking all around and seeing no one, he struck the Egyptian dead and hid him in the sand.
02Ex 2:13 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you attacking your neighbor?"
02Ex 2:14 "Who made you a leader and judge over us?" the man replied. "Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses became afraid and thought: What I did is certainly known.
02Ex 2:15 When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well.
02Ex 2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
02Ex 2:17 Then some shepherds arrived and drove them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their flock.
02Ex 2:18 When they returned to their father Reuel he asked, "Why have you come back so quickly today?"
02Ex 2:19 They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
02Ex 2:20 "So where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why then did you leave the man behind? Invite him to eat dinner."
02Ex 2:21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses [in marriage].
02Ex 2:22 She gave birth to a son whom he named Gershom, for he said, "I have become a stranger in a foreign land."
02Ex 2:23 After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of their difficult labor, and they cried out; and their cry for help ascended to God because of the difficult labor.
02Ex 2:24 So God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
02Ex 2:25 God saw the Israelites, and He took notice.
02Ex 3:1 Meanwhile Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
02Ex 3:2 Then the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire within a bush. As Moses looked, he saw that the bush was on fire but was not consumed.
02Ex 3:3 So Moses thought: I must go over and look at this remarkable sight. Why isn't the bush burning up?
02Ex 3:4 When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from the bush, "Moses, Moses!" "Here I am," he answered.
02Ex 3:5 "Do not come closer," He said. "Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
02Ex 3:6 Then He continued, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.
02Ex 3:7 Then the LORD said, "I have observed the misery of My people in Egypt, and have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I know about their sufferings.
02Ex 3:8 I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey-- the territory of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
02Ex 3:9 The Israelites' cry for help has come to Me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
02Ex 3:10 Therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."
02Ex 3:11 But Moses asked God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
02Ex 3:12 He answered, "I will certainly be with you, and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will all worship God at this mountain."
02Ex 3:13 Then Moses asked God, "If I go to the Israelites and say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, 'What is His name?' what should I tell them?"
02Ex 3:14 God replied to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you."
02Ex 3:15 God also said to Moses, "Say this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
02Ex 3:16 "Go and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I have paid close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt.
02Ex 3:17 And I have promised you that I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites-- a land flowing with milk and honey.
02Ex 3:18 They will listen to what you say. Then you, along with the elders of Israel, must go to the king of Egypt and say to him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
02Ex 3:19 "However, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, unless [he is forced] by a strong hand.
02Ex 3:20 I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles that I will perform in it. After that, he will let you go.
02Ex 3:21 And I will give this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
02Ex 3:22 Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians."
02Ex 4:1 Then Moses answered, "What if they won't believe me and will not obey me but say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?"
02Ex 4:2 The LORD asked him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.
02Ex 4:3 Then He said, "Throw it on the ground." He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses ran from it,
02Ex 4:4 but the LORD told him, "Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail." So he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand.
02Ex 4:5 "This will take place," He continued, "so they will believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
02Ex 4:6 In addition the LORD said to him, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was diseased, like snow.
02Ex 4:7 Then He said, "Put your hand back inside your cloak." He put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it had again become like the rest of his skin.
02Ex 4:8 "If they will not believe you and will not respond to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign.
02Ex 4:9 And if they don't believe even these two signs or listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground."
02Ex 4:10 But Moses replied to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent-- either in the past or recently or since You have been speaking to Your servant-- because I am slow and hesitant in speech."
02Ex 4:11 The LORD said to him, "Who made the human mouth? Who makes him mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
02Ex 4:12 Now go! I will help you speak and I will teach you what to say."
02Ex 4:13 Moses said, "Please, Lord, send someone else."
02Ex 4:14 Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses, and He said, "Isn't Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, he is on his way now to meet you. When he sees you, his heart will rejoice.
02Ex 4:15 You will speak with him and tell him what to say. I will help both you and him [to speak], and will teach you both what to do.
02Ex 4:16 He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and you will serve as God to him.
02Ex 4:17 And take this staff in your hand that you will perform the signs with."
02Ex 4:18 Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, "Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still living." Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
02Ex 4:19 Now in Midian the LORD told Moses, "Return to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and set out for the land of Egypt. And Moses took God's staff in his hand.
02Ex 4:21 The LORD instructed Moses, "When you go back to Egypt, make sure you do in front of Pharaoh all the wonders I have put within your power. But I will harden his heart so that he won't let the people go.
02Ex 4:22 Then you will say to Pharaoh: This is what the LORD says: Israel is My firstborn son.
02Ex 4:23 I told you: Let My son go so that he may worship Me, but you refused to let him go. Now I will kill your firstborn son!"
02Ex 4:24 On the trip, at an overnight campsite, it happened that the LORD confronted him and sought to put him to death.
02Ex 4:25 So Zipporah took a flint, cut off her son's foreskin, and threw it at Moses' feet. Then she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood to me!"
02Ex 4:26 So He let him alone. At that time she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood," referring to the circumcision.
02Ex 4:27 Now the LORD had said to Aaron, "Go and meet Moses in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
02Ex 4:28 Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and about all the signs He had commanded him [to do].
02Ex 4:29 Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites.
02Ex 4:30 Aaron repeated everything the LORD had said to Moses and performed the signs before the people.
02Ex 4:31 The people believed, and when they heard that the LORD had paid attention to them and that He had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
02Ex 5:1 Later, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Let My people go, so that they may hold a festival for Me in the wilderness."
02Ex 5:2 But Pharaoh responded, "Who is the LORD that I should obey Him by letting Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and what's more, I will not let Israel go."
02Ex 5:3 Then they answered, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, or else He may strike us with plague or sword."
02Ex 5:4 The king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why are you causing the people to neglect their work? Get to your labors!"
02Ex 5:5 Pharaoh also said, "Look, the people of the land are so numerous, and you would stop them from working."
02Ex 5:6 That day Pharaoh commanded the overseers of the people as well as their foremen:
02Ex 5:7 "Don't continue to supply the people with straw for making bricks, as before. They must go and gather straw for themselves.
02Ex 5:8 But require the same quota of bricks from them as they were making before; do not reduce it. For they are slackers-- that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
02Ex 5:9 Impose heavier work on the men. Then they will be occupied with it and not pay attention to deceptive words."
02Ex 5:10 So the overseers and foremen of the people went out and said to them, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I am not giving you straw.
02Ex 5:11 Go get straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but there will be no reduction at all in your workload.'"
02Ex 5:12 So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
02Ex 5:13 The overseers insisted, "Finish your assigned work each day, just as [you did] when straw was [provided]."
02Ex 5:14 Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh's slave drivers had set over the people, were beaten and asked, "Why haven't you finished making your prescribed number of bricks yesterday or today, as [you did] before?"
02Ex 5:15 So the Israelite foremen went in and cried for help to Pharaoh: "Why are you treating your servants this way?
02Ex 5:16 No straw has been given to your servants, yet they say to us, 'Make bricks!' Look, your servants are being beaten, but it is your own people who are at fault."
02Ex 5:17 But he said, "You are slackers. Slackers! That is why you are saying, 'Let us go sacrifice to the LORD.'
02Ex 5:18 Now get to work. No straw will be given to you, but you must produce the same quantity of bricks."
02Ex 5:19 The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, "You cannot reduce your daily quota of bricks."
02Ex 5:20 When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood [waiting] to meet them.
02Ex 5:21 "May the LORD take note of you and judge," they said to them, "because you have made us reek in front of Pharaoh and his officials-- putting a sword in their hand to kill us!"
02Ex 5:22 So Moses went back to the LORD and asked, "Lord, why have You caused trouble for this people? And why did You ever send me?
02Ex 5:23 Ever since I went in to Pharaoh to speak in Your name he has caused trouble for this people, and You haven't delivered Your people at all."
02Ex 6:1 But the LORD replied to Moses, "Now you are going to see what I will do to Pharaoh: he will let them go because of My strong hand; he will drive them out of his land because of My strong hand."
02Ex 6:2 Then God spoke to Moses, telling him, "I am Yahweh.
02Ex 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I did not make My name Yahweh known to them.
02Ex 6:4 I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land they lived in as foreigners.
02Ex 6:5 Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are forcing to work as slaves, and I have remembered My covenant.
02Ex 6:6 "Therefore tell the Israelites: I am Yahweh, and I will deliver you from the forced labor of the Egyptians and free you from slavery to them. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great acts of judgment.
02Ex 6:7 I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am Yahweh your God, who delivered you from the forced labor of the Egyptians.
02Ex 6:8 I will bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD."
02Ex 6:9 Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their broken spirit and hard labor.
02Ex 6:10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses,
02Ex 6:11 "Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go from his land."
02Ex 6:12 But Moses said in the LORD's presence: "If the Israelites will not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am such a poor speaker?"
02Ex 6:13 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them commands concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
02Ex 6:14 These are the heads of their fathers' families: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the clans of Reuben.
02Ex 6:15 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the clans of Simeon.
02Ex 6:16 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogy: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
02Ex 6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
02Ex 6:18 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
02Ex 6:19 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their genealogy.
02Ex 6:20 Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
02Ex 6:21 The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
02Ex 6:22 The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
02Ex 6:23 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02Ex 6:24 The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the clans of the Korahites.
02Ex 6:25 Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levite families by their clans.
02Ex 6:26 It was this Aaron and Moses whom the LORD told, "Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt according to their divisions."
02Ex 6:27 Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
02Ex 6:28 On the day the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
02Ex 6:29 He said to him, "I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I am telling you."
02Ex 6:30 But Moses replied in the LORD's presence, "Since I am such a poor speaker, how will Pharaoh listen to me?"
02Ex 7:1 The LORD answered Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.
02Ex 7:2 You must say whatever I command you; then Aaron your brother must declare it to Pharaoh so that he will let the Israelites go from his land.
02Ex 7:3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:4 Pharaoh will not listen to you, but I will put My hand on Egypt and bring out the ranks of My people the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
02Ex 7:5 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out My hand against Egypt, and bring out the Israelites from among them."
02Ex 7:6 So Moses and Aaron did [this]; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
02Ex 7:7 Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02Ex 7:8 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
02Ex 7:9 "When Pharaoh tells you: Perform a miracle, tell Aaron: Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh. It will become a serpent."
02Ex 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent.
02Ex 7:11 But then Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers-- the magicians of Egypt, and they also did the same thing by their occult practices.
02Ex 7:12 Each one threw down his staff, and it became a serpent. But Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs.
02Ex 7:13 However, Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh is unresponsive: he refuses to let the people go.
02Ex 7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. When you see him walking out to the water, stand ready to meet him by the bank of the Nile. Take in your hand the staff that turned into a snake.
02Ex 7:16 Tell him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness, but so far you have not listened.
02Ex 7:17 This is what the LORD says: Here is how you will know that I am the LORD. Watch. I will strike the water in the Nile with the staff in my hand, and it will turn to blood.
02Ex 7:18 The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from it."
02Ex 7:19 So the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-- over their rivers, canals, ponds, and all their water reservoirs-- and they will become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone [containers]."
02Ex 7:20 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded; in the sight of Pharaoh and his officials, he raised the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile was turned to blood.
02Ex 7:21 The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad the Egyptians could not drink water from it. There was blood throughout the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same thing by their occult practices. So Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:23 Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and didn't even take this to heart.
02Ex 7:24 All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink the water from the river.
02Ex 7:25 Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
02Ex 8:1  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and tell him: This is what the LORD says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
02Ex 8:2 But if you refuse to let them go, then I will plague all your territory with frogs.
02Ex 8:3 The Nile will swarm with frogs; they will come up and go into your palace, into your bedroom and on your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.
02Ex 8:4 The frogs will come up on you, your people, and all your officials."
02Ex 8:5  The LORD then said to Moses, "Tell Aaron: Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of Egypt."
02Ex 8:6 When Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:7 But the magicians did the same thing by their occult practices and brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:8 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Ask the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and my people. Then I will let the people go and they can sacrifice to the LORD."
02Ex 8:9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "Make the choice rather than me [by saying] when I should ask for you, your officials, and your people, that the frogs be taken away from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:10 "Tomorrow," he answered. Moses replied, "As you have said, so you may know there is no one like the LORD our God,
02Ex 8:11 the frogs will go away from you, your houses, your officials, and your people. The frogs will remain only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:12 After Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD for help concerning the frogs that He had brought against Pharaoh.
02Ex 8:13 The LORD did as Moses had said: the frogs in the houses, courtyards, and fields died.
02Ex 8:14 They piled them in countless heaps, and there was a terrible odor in the land.
02Ex 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:16 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it will become gnats throughout the land of Egypt."
02Ex 8:17 And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and when he struck the dust of the earth, gnats were on the people and animals. All the dust of the earth became gnats throughout the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:18 The magicians tried to produce gnats using their occult practices, but they could not. The gnats remained on the people and animals.
02Ex 8:19 "This is the finger of God," the magicians said to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:20 The LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh when you see him going out to the water. Tell him: This is what the LORD says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
02Ex 8:21 But if you will not let My people go, then I will send swarms of flies against you, your officials, your people, and your houses. The Egyptians' houses will swarm with flies, and so will the land where they live.
02Ex 8:22 But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where My people are living; no flies will be there. This way you will know that I, the Lord, am in the land.
02Ex 8:23 I will make a distinction between My people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow."
02Ex 8:24 And the LORD did this. Thick swarms of flies went into Pharaoh's palace and his officials' houses. Throughout Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.
02Ex 8:25 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go sacrifice to your God within the country."
02Ex 8:26 But Moses said, "It would not be right to do that, because what we will sacrifice to the LORD our God is detestable to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what the Egyptians detest in front of them, won't they stone us?
02Ex 8:27 We must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He instructs us."
02Ex 8:28 Pharaoh responded, "I will let you go and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but don't go very far. Make an appeal for me."
02Ex 8:29 "As soon as I leave you," Moses said, "I will appeal to the Lord, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceptively again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD."
02Ex 8:30 Then Moses left Pharaoh's presence and appealed to the LORD.
02Ex 8:31 The LORD did as Moses had said: He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people; not one was left.
02Ex 8:32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go.
02Ex 9:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh and say to him: This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
02Ex 9:2 But if you refuse to let [them] go and keep holding them,
02Ex 9:3 then the LORD's hand will bring a severe plague against your livestock in the field-- the horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks.
02Ex 9:4 But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that the Israelites own will die."
02Ex 9:5 And the LORD set a time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
02Ex 9:6 The LORD did this the next day. All the Egyptian livestock died, but none among the Israelite livestock died.
02Ex 9:7 Pharaoh sent [messengers] who saw that not a single one of the Israelite livestock was dead. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
02Ex 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of furnace soot, and Moses is to throw it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
02Ex 9:9 It will become fine dust over the entire land of Egypt. It will become festering boils on people and animals throughout the land of Egypt."
02Ex 9:10 So they took furnace soot and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw it toward heaven, and it became festering boils on man and beast.
02Ex 9:11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.
02Ex 9:12 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had told Moses.
02Ex 9:13 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh. Tell him: This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
02Ex 9:14 Otherwise, I am going to send all My plagues against you, your officials, and your people. Then you will know there is no one like Me in all the earth.
02Ex 9:15 By now I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been obliterated from the earth.
02Ex 9:16 However, I have let you live for this purpose: to show you My power and to make My name known in all the earth.
02Ex 9:17 You are still acting arrogantly against My people by not letting them go.
02Ex 9:18 Tomorrow at this time I will rain down the worst hail that has ever occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
02Ex 9:19 Therefore give orders to bring your livestock and all that you have in the field into shelters. Every person and animal that is in the field and not brought inside will die when the hail falls on them."
02Ex 9:20 Those among Pharaoh's officials who feared the word of the LORD made their servants and livestock flee to shelters,
02Ex 9:21 but those who didn't take the LORD's word seriously left their servants and livestock in the field.
02Ex 9:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven and let there be hail throughout the land of Egypt-- on man and beast and every plant of the field in the land of Egypt."
02Ex 9:23 So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail. Lightning struck the earth, and the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 9:24 The hail, with lightning flashing through it, was so severe that nothing like it had occurred in the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
02Ex 9:25 Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything in the field, both man and beast. The hail beat down every plant of the field and shattered every tree in the field.
02Ex 9:26 The only place it didn't hail was in the land of Goshen where the Israelites were.
02Ex 9:27 Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. "I have sinned this time," he said to them. "The LORD is the Righteous One, and I and my people are the guilty ones.
02Ex 9:28 Make an appeal to the LORD. There has been enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't need to stay any longer."
02Ex 9:29 Moses said to him, "When I have left the city, I will extend my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know the earth is the LORD's.
02Ex 9:30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear the LORD God."
02Ex 9:31 The flax and the barley were destroyed because the barley was ripe and the flax was budding,
02Ex 9:32 but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed since they are later crops.
02Ex 9:33 Moses went out from Pharaoh and the city, and extended his hands to the LORD. Then the thunder and hail ceased, and rain no longer poured down on the land.
02Ex 9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his officials.
02Ex 9:35 So Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not let the Israelites go, as the LORD had said through Moses.
02Ex 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may do these miraculous signs of Mine among them,
02Ex 10:2 and so that you may tell your son and grandson how severely I dealt with the Egyptians and performed miraculous signs among them, and you will know that I am the LORD."
02Ex 10:3 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and told him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may worship Me.
02Ex 10:4 But if you refuse to let My people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
02Ex 10:5 They will cover the surface of the land so that no one will be able to see the land. They will eat the remainder left to you that escaped the hail; they will eat every tree you have growing in the fields.
02Ex 10:6 They will fill your houses, all your officials' houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians-- something your fathers and ancestors never saw since the time they occupied the land until today." Then he turned and left Pharaoh's presence.
02Ex 10:7 Pharaoh's officials asked him, "How long must this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Don't you realize yet that Egypt is devastated?"
02Ex 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," Pharaoh said. "But exactly who will be going?"
02Ex 10:9 Moses replied, "We will go with our young and our old; we will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds because we must hold the LORD's festival."
02Ex 10:10 He said to them, "May the LORD be with you if I [ever] let you and your families go! Look out-- you are planning evil.
02Ex 10:11 No, only the men may go and worship the LORD, for that is what you have been asking for." And they were driven from Pharaoh's presence.
02Ex 10:12 The LORD then said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt and the locusts will come up over it and eat every plant in the land, everything that the hail left."
02Ex 10:13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD sent an east wind over the land all that day and through the night. By morning the east wind had brought in the locusts.
02Ex 10:14 The locusts went up over the entire land of Egypt and settled on the whole territory of Egypt. Never before had there been such a large number of locusts, and there will never be again.
02Ex 10:15 They covered the surface of the whole land so that the land was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on the trees or the plants in the field throughout the land of Egypt.
02Ex 10:16 Pharaoh urgently sent for Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
02Ex 10:17 Please forgive my sin once more and make an appeal to the LORD your God, so that He will take this death away from me."
02Ex 10:18 Moses left Pharaoh's presence and appealed to the LORD.
02Ex 10:19 Then the LORD changed the wind to a strong west wind, and it carried off the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.
02Ex 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the Israelites go.
02Ex 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be felt."
02Ex 10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three days.
02Ex 10:23 One person could not see another, and for three days they did not move from where they were. Yet all the Israelites had light where they lived.
02Ex 10:24 Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your families may go with you; only your flocks and your herds must stay behind."
02Ex 10:25 Moses responded, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to prepare for the LORD our God.
02Ex 10:26 Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind because we will take some of them to worship the LORD our God. We will not know what we will use to worship the LORD until we get there."
02Ex 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.
02Ex 10:28 Pharaoh said to him, "Leave me! Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die."
02Ex 10:29 "As you've said," Moses replied, "I will never see your face again."
02Ex 11:1 The LORD said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he lets [you] go, he will drive you out of here.
02Ex 11:2 Now announce to the people that both men and women should ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry."
02Ex 11:3 The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And the man Moses was feared in the land of Egypt, by Pharaoh's officials and the people.
02Ex 11:4 So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt
02Ex 11:5 and every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the servant girl who is behind the millstones, as well as every firstborn of the livestock.
02Ex 11:6 Then there will be a great cry of anguish through all the land of Egypt such as never was before, or ever will be again.
02Ex 11:7 But against all the Israelites, whether man or beast, not [even] a dog will snarl, so that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
02Ex 11:8 All these officials of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: Leave, you and all the people who follow you. After that, I will leave.' " And he left Pharaoh's presence in fierce anger.
02Ex 11:9 The LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
02Ex 11:10 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his land.
02Ex 12:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:
02Ex 12:2 "This month is to be the beginning of months for you; it is the first month of your year.
02Ex 12:3 Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they must each select an animal of the flock according to [their] fathers' households, one animal per household.
02Ex 12:4 If the household is too small for a [whole] animal, that person and the neighbor nearest his house are to select one based on the combined number of people; you should apportion the animal according to what each person will eat.
02Ex 12:5 You must have an unblemished animal, a year-old male; you may take it from either the sheep or the goats.
02Ex 12:6 You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight.
02Ex 12:7 They must take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat them.
02Ex 12:8 They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
02Ex 12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over fire-- its head as well as its legs and inner organs.
02Ex 12:10 Do not let any of it remain until morning; you must burn up any part of it that does remain until morning.
02Ex 12:11 Here is how you must eat it: dressed for travel, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it in a hurry; it is the LORD's Passover.
02Ex 12:12 "I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and strike every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. I am the LORD; I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt.
02Ex 12:13 The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy [you] when I strike the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:14 "This day is to be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the LORD. You are to celebrate it throughout your generations as a permanent statute.
02Ex 12:15 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day you must remove yeast from your houses. Whoever eats what is leavened from the first day through the seventh day must be cut off from Israel.
02Ex 12:16 You are to hold a sacred assembly on the first day and another sacred assembly on the seventh day. No work may be done on those [days] except for preparing what people need to eat-- you may do only that.
02Ex 12:17 "You are to observe the [Festival of] Unleavened Bread because on this very day I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt. You must observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent statute.
02Ex 12:18 You are to eat unleavened bread in the first [month], from the evening of the fourteenth day of the month until the evening of the twenty-first day.
02Ex 12:19 Yeast must not be found in your houses for seven days. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreign resident or native of the land, must be cut off from the community of Israel.
02Ex 12:20 Do not eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes."
02Ex 12:21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go, select an animal from the flock according to your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb.
02Ex 12:22 Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and brush the lintel and the two doorposts with some of the blood in the basin. None of you may go out the door of his house until morning.
02Ex 12:23 When the LORD passes through to strike Egypt and sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, He will pass over the door and not let the destroyer enter your houses to strike [you].
02Ex 12:24 "Keep this command permanently as a statute for you and your descendants.
02Ex 12:25 When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to observe this ritual.
02Ex 12:26 When your children ask you, 'What does this ritual mean to you?'
02Ex 12:27 you are to reply, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, for He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and spared our homes.' " So the people bowed down and worshiped.
02Ex 12:28 Then the Israelites went and did [this]; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:29 Now at midnight the LORD struck every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock.
02Ex 12:30 During the night Pharaoh got up, he along with all his officials and all the Egyptians, and there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt because there wasn't a house without someone dead.
02Ex 12:31 He summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, "Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites, and go, worship the LORD as you have asked.
02Ex 12:32 Take even your flocks and your herds as you asked, and leave, and this will also be a blessing to me."
02Ex 12:33 Now the Egyptians pressured the people in order to send them quickly out of the country, for they said, "We're all going to die!"
02Ex 12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their clothes on their shoulders.
02Ex 12:35 The Israelites acted on Moses' word and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
02Ex 12:36 And the LORD gave the people such favor in the Egyptians' sight that they gave them what they requested. In this way they plundered the Egyptians.
02Ex 12:37 The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about 600,000 soldiers on foot, besides their families.
02Ex 12:38 An ethnically diverse crowd also went up with them, along with a huge number of livestock, both flocks and herds.
02Ex 12:39 The people baked the dough they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves, since it had no yeast; for when they had been driven out of Egypt they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves.
02Ex 12:40 The time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years.
02Ex 12:41 At the end of 430 years, on that same day, all the divisions of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:42 It was a night of vigil in honor of the LORD, because He would bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night is in honor of the LORD, a night vigil for all the Israelites throughout their generations.
02Ex 12:43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner may eat it.
02Ex 12:44 But any slave a man has purchased may eat it, after you have circumcised him.
02Ex 12:45 A temporary resident or hired hand may not eat the Passover.
02Ex 12:46 It is to be eaten in one house. You may not take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of its bones.
02Ex 12:47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
02Ex 12:48 If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate the LORD's Passover, every male in his household must be circumcised, and then he may participate; he will become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat it.
02Ex 12:49 The same law will apply to both the native and the foreigner who resides among you."
02Ex 12:50 Then all the Israelites did [this]; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:51 On that same day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt according to their military divisions.
02Ex 13:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02Ex 13:2 "Consecrate every firstborn male to Me, the firstborn from every womb among the Israelites, both man and animal; it is Mine."
02Ex 13:3 Then Moses said to the people, "Remember this day when you came out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, for the LORD brought you out of here by the strength of [His] hand. Nothing leavened may be eaten.
02Ex 13:4 Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
02Ex 13:5 When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you must carry out this ritual in this month.
02Ex 13:6 For seven days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to the LORD.
02Ex 13:7 Unleavened bread is to be eaten for those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, and no yeast may be found among you in all your territory.
02Ex 13:8 On that day explain to your son, 'This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
02Ex 13:9 Let it serve as a sign for you on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for the LORD brought you out of Egypt with a strong hand.
02Ex 13:10 Keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
02Ex 13:11 "When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,
02Ex 13:12 you are to present to the LORD every firstborn male of the womb. All firstborn offspring of the livestock you own that are males will be the LORD's.
02Ex 13:13 You must redeem every firstborn of a donkey with a flock animal, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. However, you must redeem every firstborn among your sons.
02Ex 13:14 "In the future, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'By the strength of [His] hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
02Ex 13:15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn [male] in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of livestock. That is why I sacrifice to the LORD all the firstborn of the womb that are males, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.'
02Ex 13:16 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand."
02Ex 13:17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby; for God said, "The people will change their minds and return to Egypt if they face war."
02Ex 13:18 So He led the people around toward the Red Sea along the road of the wilderness. And the Israelites left the land of Egypt in battle formation.
02Ex 13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites swear a solemn oath, saying, "God will certainly come to your aid; then you must take my bones with you from this place."
02Ex 13:20 They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
02Ex 13:21 The LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to lead them on their way during the day and in a pillar of fire to give them light at night, so that they could travel day or night.
02Ex 13:22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never left its place in front of the people.
02Ex 14:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
02Ex 14:2 "Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you must camp in front of Baal-zephon, facing it by the sea.
02Ex 14:3 Pharaoh will say of the Israelites: They are wandering around the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.
02Ex 14:4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart so that he will pursue them. Then I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this.
02Ex 14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people and said: "What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us."
02Ex 14:6 So he got his chariot ready and took his troops with him;
02Ex 14:7 he took 600 of the best chariots and all the rest of the chariots of Egypt, with officers in each one.
02Ex 14:8 The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out triumphantly.
02Ex 14:9 The Egyptians-- all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, his horsemen, and his army-- chased after them and caught up with them as they camped by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
02Ex 14:10 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians coming after them. Then the Israelites were terrified and cried out to the LORD for help.
02Ex 14:11 They said to Moses: "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
02Ex 14:12 Isn't this what we told you in Egypt: Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
02Ex 14:13 But Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand firm and see the LORD's salvation He will provide for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again.
02Ex 14:14 The LORD will fight for you; you must be quiet."
02Ex 14:15 The LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to break camp.
02Ex 14:16 As for you, lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
02Ex 14:17 I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them, and I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh, all his army, and his chariots and horsemen.
02Ex 14:18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I receive glory through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
02Ex 14:19 Then the Angel of God, who was going in front of the Israelite forces, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and stood behind them.
02Ex 14:20 It came between the Egyptian and Israelite forces. The cloud was there [in] the darkness, yet it lit up the night. So neither group came near the other all night long.
02Ex 14:21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The LORD drove the sea [back] with a powerful east wind all that night and turned the sea into dry land. So the waters were divided,
02Ex 14:22 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with the waters [like] a wall to them on their right and their left.
02Ex 14:23 The Egyptians set out in pursuit-- all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen-- and went into the sea after them.
02Ex 14:24 Then during the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian forces from the pillar of fire and cloud, and threw them into confusion.
02Ex 14:25 He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty. "Let's get away from Israel," the Egyptians said, "because the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!"
02Ex 14:26 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back on the Egyptians, on their chariots and horsemen."
02Ex 14:27 So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. While the Egyptians were trying to escape from it, the LORD overthrew them in the sea.
02Ex 14:28 The waters came back and covered the chariots and horsemen, the entire army of Pharaoh, that had gone after them into the sea. None of them survived.
02Ex 14:29 But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with the waters [like] a wall to them on their right and their left.
02Ex 14:30 That day the LORD saved Israel from the power of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
02Ex 14:31 When Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses.
02Ex 15:1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD. They said: I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.
02Ex 15:2 The LORD is my strength and my song; He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him.
02Ex 15:3 The LORD is a warrior; Yahweh is His name.
02Ex 15:4 He threw Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea; the elite of his officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
02Ex 15:5 The floods covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
02Ex 15:6 LORD, Your right hand is glorious in power. LORD, Your right hand shattered the enemy.
02Ex 15:7 You overthrew Your adversaries by Your great majesty. You unleashed Your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble.
02Ex 15:8 The waters heaped up at the blast of Your nostrils; the currents stood firm like a dam. The watery depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
02Ex 15:9 The enemy said: "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil. My desire will be gratified at their expense. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them."
02Ex 15:10 But You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02Ex 15:11 LORD, who is like You among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders?
02Ex 15:12 You stretched out Your right hand, and the earth swallowed them.
02Ex 15:13 You will lead the people You have redeemed with Your faithful love; You will guide [them] to Your holy dwelling with Your strength.
02Ex 15:14 When the peoples hear, they will shudder; anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.
02Ex 15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; the inhabitants of Canaan will panic;
02Ex 15:16 and terror and dread will fall on them. They will be as still as a stone because of Your powerful arm until Your people pass by, LORD, until the people whom You purchased pass by.
02Ex 15:17 You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your possession; LORD, You have prepared the place for Your dwelling; Lord, Your hands have established the sanctuary.
02Ex 15:18 The LORD will reign forever and ever!
02Ex 15:19 When Pharaoh's horses with his chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
02Ex 15:20 Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
02Ex 15:21 Miriam sang to them: Sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea.
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led Israel on from the Red Sea, and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur. They journeyed for three days in the wilderness without finding water.
02Ex 15:23 They came to Marah, but they could not drink the water at Marah because it was bitter-- that is why it was named Marah.
02Ex 15:24 The people grumbled to Moses, "What are we going to drink?"
02Ex 15:25 So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became drinkable. He made a statute and ordinance for them at Marah and He tested them there.
02Ex 15:26 He said, "If you will carefully obey the LORD your God, do what is right in His eyes, pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, I will not inflict any illness on you I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you."
02Ex 15:27 Then they came to Elim, where there were 12 springs of water and 70 date palms, and they camped there by the waters.
02Ex 16:1 The entire Israelite community departed from Elim and came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt.
02Ex 16:2 The entire Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
02Ex 16:3 The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD's hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by pots of meat and ate all the bread we wanted. Instead, you brought us into this wilderness to make this whole assembly die of hunger!"
02Ex 16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I am going to rain bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. This way I will test them to see whether or not they will follow My instructions.
02Ex 16:5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days."
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: "This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
02Ex 16:7 in the morning you will see the LORD's glory because He has heard your complaints about Him. For who are we that you complain about us?"
02Ex 16:8 Moses continued, "The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and abundant bread in the morning, for He has heard the complaints that you are raising against Him. Who are we? Your complaints are not against us but against the LORD."
02Ex 16:9 Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before the LORD, for He has heard your complaints.'"
02Ex 16:10 As Aaron was speaking to the entire Israelite community, they turned toward the wilderness, and there, in a cloud, the LORD's glory appeared.
02Ex 16:11 The LORD spoke to Moses,
02Ex 16:12 "I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them: At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will eat bread until you are full. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God."
02Ex 16:13 So at evening quail came and covered the camp. In the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp.
02Ex 16:14 When the layer of dew evaporated, there on the desert surface were fine flakes, as fine as frost on the ground.
02Ex 16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, "What is it?" because they didn't know what it was. Moses told them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.
02Ex 16:16 This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Gather as much of it as each person needs to eat. You may take two quarts per individual, according to the number of people each of you has in his tent.'"
02Ex 16:17 So the Israelites did this. Some gathered a lot, some a little.
02Ex 16:18 When they measured it by quarts, the person who gathered a lot had no surplus, and the person who gathered a little had no shortage. Each gathered as much as he needed to eat.
02Ex 16:19 Moses said to them, "No one is to let any of it remain until morning."
02Ex 16:20 But they didn't listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and smelled. Therefore Moses was angry with them.
02Ex 16:21 They gathered it every morning. Each gathered as much as he needed to eat, but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
02Ex 16:22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts apiece, and all the leaders of the community came and reported [this] to Moses.
02Ex 16:23 He told them, "This is what the LORD has said: 'Tomorrow is a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil, and everything left over set aside to be kept until morning.'"
02Ex 16:24 So they set it aside until morning as Moses commanded, and it didn't smell or have any maggots in it.
02Ex 16:25 "Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you won't find any in the field.
02Ex 16:26 For six days you may gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none."
02Ex 16:27 Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find any.
02Ex 16:28 Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep My commands and instructions?
02Ex 16:29 Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day He will give you two days' worth of bread. Each of you stay where you are; no one is to leave his place on the seventh day."
02Ex 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
02Ex 16:31 The house of Israel named the substance manna. It resembled coriander seed, was white, and tasted like wafers [made] with honey.
02Ex 16:32 Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: 'Two quarts of it are to be preserved throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 16:33 Moses told Aaron, "Take a container and put two quarts of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved throughout your generations."
02Ex 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the testimony to be preserved.
02Ex 16:35 The Israelites ate manna for 40 years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate manna until they reached the border of the land of Canaan.
02Ex 16:36 (Two quarts are a tenth of an ephah.)
02Ex 17:1 The entire Israelite community left the Wilderness of Sin, moving from one place to the next according to the LORD's command. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
02Ex 17:2 So the people complained to Moses: "Give us water to drink." "Why are you complaining to me?" Moses replied to them. "Why are you testing the LORD?"
02Ex 17:3 But the people thirsted there for water, and grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you ever bring us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
02Ex 17:4 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What should I do with these people? In a little while they will stone me!"
02Ex 17:5 The LORD answered Moses, "Go on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take the rod you struck the Nile with in your hand and go.
02Ex 17:6 I am going to stand there in front of you on the rock at Horeb; when you hit the rock, water will come out of it and the people will drink." Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02Ex 17:7 He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites complained, and because they tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
02Ex 17:8 At Rephidim, Amalek came and fought against Israel.
02Ex 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Select some men for us, and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with God's staff in my hand."
02Ex 17:10 Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
02Ex 17:11 While Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, but whenever he put his hand down, Amalek prevailed.
02Ex 17:12 When Moses' hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put [it] under him, and he sat down on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down.
02Ex 17:13 So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword.
02Ex 17:14 The LORD then said to Moses, "Write this down on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua: I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek under heaven."
02Ex 17:15 And Moses built an altar and named it, "The LORD Is My Banner."
02Ex 17:16 He said, "Indeed, [my] hand is [lifted up] toward the LORD's throne. The LORD will be at war with Amalek from generation to generation."
02Ex 18:1 Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and His people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02Ex 18:2 Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken in Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
02Ex 18:3 along with her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom (because Moses had said, "I have been a stranger in a foreign land")
02Ex 18:4 and the other Eliezer (because [he had said,] "The God of my father was my helper and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword").
02Ex 18:5 Moses' father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses' wife and sons, came to him in the wilderness where he was camped at the mountain of God.
02Ex 18:6 He sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."
02Ex 18:7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and then kissed him. They asked each other how they had been and went into the tent.
02Ex 18:8 Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that confronted them on the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
02Ex 18:9 Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the LORD had done for Israel when He rescued them from the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:10 "Blessed is the LORD," Jethro exclaimed, "who rescued you from Pharaoh and the power of the Egyptians, and snatched the people from the power of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because He [did wonders] at the time the Egyptians acted arrogantly against Israel."
02Ex 18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law in God's presence.
02Ex 18:13 The next day Moses sat down to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning until evening.
02Ex 18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw everything he was doing for them he asked, "What is this thing you're doing for the people? Why are you alone sitting as judge, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?"
02Ex 18:15 Moses replied to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
02Ex 18:16 Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I make a decision between one man and another. I teach [them] God's statutes and laws."
02Ex 18:17 "What you're doing is not good," Moses' father-in-law said to him.
02Ex 18:18 "You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You can't do it alone.
02Ex 18:19 Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and God be with you. You be the one to represent the people before God and bring their cases to Him.
02Ex 18:20 Instruct them about the statutes and laws, and teach them the way to live and what they must do.
02Ex 18:21 But you should select from all the people able men, God-fearing, trustworthy, and hating bribes. Place [them] over the people as officials of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
02Ex 18:22 They should judge the people at all times. Then they can bring you every important case but judge every minor case themselves. In this way you will lighten your load, and they will bear [it] with you.
02Ex 18:23 If you do this, and God [so] directs you, you will be able to endure, and also all these people will be able to go home satisfied."
02Ex 18:24 Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
02Ex 18:25 So Moses chose able men from all Israel and made them leaders over the people [as] officials of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
02Ex 18:26 They judged the people at all times; the hard cases they would bring to Moses, but every minor case they would judge themselves.
02Ex 18:27 Then Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law, and he journeyed to his own land.
02Ex 19:1 In the third month, on the same day [of the month] that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai.
02Ex 19:2 After they departed from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
02Ex 19:3 Moses went up [the mountain] to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain: "This is what you must say to the house of Jacob, and explain to the Israelites:
02Ex 19:4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to Me.
02Ex 19:5 Now if you will listen to Me and carefully keep My covenant, you will be My own possession out of all the peoples, although all the earth is Mine,
02Ex 19:6 and you will be My kingdom of priests and My holy nation. These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites."
02Ex 19:7 After Moses came back, He summoned the elders of the people, and put before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 19:8 Then all the people responded together, "We will do all that the LORD has spoken." So Moses brought the people's words back to the LORD.
02Ex 19:9 The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you and will always believe you." Then Moses reported the people's words to the LORD.
02Ex 19:10 And the LORD told Moses, "Go to the people and purify them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes
02Ex 19:11 and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
02Ex 19:12 Put boundaries for the people all around the [mountain] and say: Be careful that you don't go up on the mountain or touch its base. Anyone who touches the mountain will be put to death.
02Ex 19:13 No hand may touch him; instead he will be stoned or shot [with arrows], neither animal or man will live. When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they may go up the mountain."
02Ex 19:14 Then Moses came down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
02Ex 19:15 He said to the people, "Be prepared by the third day. Do not have sexual relations with women."
02Ex 19:16 On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered.
02Ex 19:17 Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 19:18 Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the LORD came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.
02Ex 19:19 As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.
02Ex 19:20 The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, at the top of the mountain. Then the LORD summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and he went up.
02Ex 19:21 The LORD directed Moses, "Go down and warn the people not to break through to see the LORD; otherwise many of them will die.
02Ex 19:22 Even the priests who come near the LORD must purify themselves or the LORD will break out [in anger] against them."
02Ex 19:23 But Moses responded to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, since You warned us: Put a boundary around the mountain and consider it holy."
02Ex 19:24 And the LORD replied to him, "Go down and come back with Aaron. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break out [in anger] against them."
02Ex 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
02Ex 20:1 Then God spoke all these words:
02Ex 20:2 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery.
02Ex 20:3 Do not have other gods besides Me.
02Ex 20:4 Do not make an idol for yourself, whether in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.
02Ex 20:5 You must not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the fathers' sin, to the third and fourth [generations] of those who hate Me,
02Ex 20:6 but showing faithful love to a thousand [generations] of those who love Me and keep My commands.
02Ex 20:7 Do not misuse the name of the LORD your God, because the LORD will punish anyone who misuses His name.
02Ex 20:8 Remember to dedicate the Sabbath day:
02Ex 20:9 You are to labor six days and do all your work,
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. You must not do any work-- you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the foreigner who is within your gates.
02Ex 20:11 For the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them in six days; then He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and declared it holy.
02Ex 20:12 Honor your father and your mother so that you may have a long life in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
02Ex 20:13 Do not murder.
02Ex 20:14 Do not commit adultery.
02Ex 20:15 Do not steal.
02Ex 20:16 Do not give false testimony against your neighbor.
02Ex 20:17 Do not covet your neighbor's house. Do not covet your neighbor's wife, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
02Ex 20:18 All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain [surrounded by] smoke. When the people saw [it] they trembled and stood at a distance.
02Ex 20:19 "You speak to us, and we will listen," they said to Moses, "but don't let God speak to us, or we will die."
02Ex 20:20 Moses responded to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that you will fear Him and will not sin."
02Ex 20:21 And the people remained standing at a distance as Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
02Ex 20:22 Then the LORD told Moses, "This is what you are to say to the Israelites: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.
02Ex 20:23 You must not make gods of silver to rival Me; you must not make [gods of gold] for yourselves.
02Ex 20:24 "You must make an earthen altar for Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats, as well as your cattle. I will come to you and bless you in every place where I cause My name to be remembered.
02Ex 20:25 If you make a stone altar for Me, you must not build it out of cut stones. If you use your chisel on it, you will defile it.
02Ex 20:26 You must not go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness is not exposed on it.
02Ex 21:1 "These are the ordinances that you must set before them:
02Ex 21:2 "When you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for six years; then in the seventh he is to leave as a free man without paying anything.
02Ex 21:3 If he arrives alone, he is to leave alone; if he arrives with a wife, his wife is to leave with him.
02Ex 21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children belong to her master, and the man must leave alone.
02Ex 21:5 "But if the slave declares: 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I do not want to leave as a free man,'
02Ex 21:6 his master is to bring him to the judges and then bring him to the door or doorpost. His master must pierce his ear with an awl, and he will serve his master for life.
02Ex 21:7 "When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to leave as the male slaves do.
02Ex 21:8 If she is displeasing to her master, who chose her for himself, then he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has acted treacherously toward her.
02Ex 21:9 Or if he chooses her for his son, he must deal with her according to the customary treatment of daughters.
02Ex 21:10 If he takes an additional wife, he must not reduce the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.
02Ex 21:11 And if he does not do these three things for her, she may leave free of charge, without any exchange of money.
02Ex 21:12 "Whoever strikes a person so that he dies must be put to death.
02Ex 21:13 But if he didn't intend any harm, and yet God caused it to happen by his hand, I will appoint a place for you where he may flee.
02Ex 21:14 If a person willfully acts against his neighbor to murder him by scheming, you must take him from My altar to be put to death.
02Ex 21:15 "Whoever strikes his father or his mother must be put to death.
02Ex 21:16 "Whoever kidnaps a person must be put to death, whether he sells him or the person is found in his possession.
02Ex 21:17 "Whoever curses his father or his mother must be put to death.
02Ex 21:18 "When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or fist, and the injured man does not die but is confined to bed,
02Ex 21:19 if he can [later] get up and walk around outside [leaning] on his staff, then the one who struck [him] will be exempt from punishment. Nevertheless, he must pay for his lost work time and provide for [his] complete recovery.
02Ex 21:20 "When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod, and the slave dies under his abuse, the owner must be punished.
02Ex 21:21 However, if the slave can stand up after a day or two, the owner should not be punished because he is his [owner's] property.
02Ex 21:22 "When men get in a fight, and hit a pregnant woman so that her children are born [prematurely], but there is no injury, the one who hit her must be fined as the woman's husband demands from him, and he must pay according to judicial assessment.
02Ex 21:23 If there is an injury, then you must give life for life,
02Ex 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02Ex 21:25 burn for burn, bruise for bruise, wound for wound.
02Ex 21:26 "When a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave and destroys it, he must let the slave go free in compensation for his eye.
02Ex 21:27 If he knocks out the tooth of his male or female slave, he must let the slave go free in compensation for his tooth.
02Ex 21:28 "When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat may not be eaten, but the ox's owner is innocent.
02Ex 21:29 However, if the ox was in the habit of goring, and its owner has been warned yet does not restrain it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox must be stoned, and its owner must also be put to death.
02Ex 21:30 If instead a ransom is demanded of him, he can pay a redemption price for his life in the full amount demanded from him.
02Ex 21:31 If it gores a son or a daughter, he is to be dealt with according to this same law.
02Ex 21:32 If the ox gores a male or female slave, he must give 30 shekels of silver to the slave's master, and the ox must be stoned.
02Ex 21:33 "When a man uncovers a pit or digs a pit, and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
02Ex 21:34 the owner of the pit must give compensation; he must pay money to its owner, but the dead animal will become his.
02Ex 21:35 "When a man's ox injures his neighbor's ox and it dies, they must sell the live ox and divide its proceeds; they must also divide the dead animal.
02Ex 21:36 If, however, it is known that the ox was in the habit of goring, yet its owner has not restrained it, he must compensate fully, ox for ox; the dead animal will become his.
02Ex 22:1  "When a man steals an ox or a sheep and butchers it or sells it, he must repay five cattle for the ox or four sheep for the sheep.
02Ex 22:2  If a thief is caught in the act of breaking in, and he is beaten to death, no one is guilty of bloodshed.
02Ex 22:3 But if this happens after sunrise, there is guilt of bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution. If he is unable, he is to be sold because of his theft.
02Ex 22:4 If what was stolen-- whether ox, donkey, or sheep-- is actually found alive in his possession, he must repay double.
02Ex 22:5 "When a man lets a field or vineyard be grazed in, and then allows his animals to go and graze in someone else's field, he must repay with the best of his own field or vineyard.
02Ex 22:6 "When a fire gets out of control, spreads to thornbushes, and consumes stacks of cut grain, standing grain, or a field, the one who started the fire must make full restitution for what was burned.
02Ex 22:7 "When a man gives his neighbor money or goods to keep, but they are stolen from that person's house, the thief, if caught, must repay double.
02Ex 22:8 If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house must present himself to the judges to determine whether or not he has taken his neighbor's property.
02Ex 22:9 In any case of wrongdoing involving an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or anything [else] lost, and someone claims: That's mine, the case between the two parties is to come before the judges. The one the judges condemn must repay double to his neighbor.
02Ex 22:10 "When a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any [other] animal to care for, but it dies, is injured, or is stolen, while no one is watching,
02Ex 22:11 there must be an oath before the LORD between the two of them to determine whether or not he has taken his neighbor's property. Its owner must accept [the oath], and the other man does not have to make restitution.
02Ex 22:12 But if, in fact, the animal was stolen from his custody, he must make restitution to its owner.
02Ex 22:13 If it was actually torn apart [by a wild animal], he is to bring it as evidence; he does not have to make restitution for the torn carcass.
02Ex 22:14 "When a man borrows [an animal] from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not there with it, the man must make full restitution.
02Ex 22:15 If its owner is there with it, the man does not have to make restitution. If it was rented, the loss is covered by its rental price.
02Ex 22:16 "When a man seduces a virgin who was not promised in marriage, and he has sexual relations with her, he must certainly pay the bridal price for her to be his wife.
02Ex 22:17 If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must pay an amount in silver equal to the bridal price for virgins.
02Ex 22:18 "You must not allow a sorceress to live.
02Ex 22:19 "Whoever has sexual intercourse with an animal must be put to death.
02Ex 22:20 "Whoever sacrifices to any gods, except the LORD alone, is to be set apart for destruction.
02Ex 22:21 "You must not exploit a foreign resident or oppress him, since you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 22:22 "You must not mistreat any widow or fatherless child.
02Ex 22:23 If you do mistreat them, they will no doubt cry to Me, and I will certainly hear their cry.
02Ex 22:24 My anger will burn, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will be widows and your children fatherless.
02Ex 22:25 "If you lend money to My people-- to the poor person among you, you must not be like a moneylender to him; you must not charge him interest.
02Ex 22:26 "If you ever take your neighbor's cloak as collateral, return it to him before sunset.
02Ex 22:27 For it is his only covering; it is the clothing for his body. What will he sleep in? And if he cries out to Me, I will listen because I am compassionate.
02Ex 22:28 "You must not blaspheme God or curse a leader among your people.
02Ex 22:29 "You must not hold back [offerings from] your harvest or your vats. Give Me the firstborn of your sons.
02Ex 22:30 Do the same with your cattle and your flock. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but on the eighth day you are to give them to Me.
02Ex 22:31 "Be My holy people. You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal [found] in the field; throw it to the dogs.
02Ex 23:1 "You must not spread a false report. Do not join the wicked to be a malicious witness.
02Ex 23:2 "You must not follow a crowd in wrongdoing. Do not testify in a lawsuit and go along with a crowd to pervert [justice].
02Ex 23:3 Do not show favoritism to a poor person in his lawsuit.
02Ex 23:4 "If you come across your enemy's stray ox or donkey, you must return it to him.
02Ex 23:5 "If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying [helpless] under its load, and you want to refrain from helping it, you must help with it.
02Ex 23:6 "You must not deny justice to the poor among you in his lawsuit.
02Ex 23:7 Stay far away from a false accusation. Do not kill the innocent and the just, because I will not justify the guilty.
02Ex 23:8 You must not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and corrupts the words of the righteous.
02Ex 23:9 You must not oppress a foreign resident; you yourselves know how it feels to be a foreigner because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 23:10 "Sow your land for six years and gather its produce.
02Ex 23:11 But during the seventh year you are to let it rest and leave it uncultivated, so that the poor among your people may eat [from it] and the wild animals may consume what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
02Ex 23:12 "Do your work for six days but rest on the seventh day so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave as well as the foreign resident may be refreshed.
02Ex 23:13 "Pay strict attention to everything I have said to you. You must not invoke the names of other gods; they must not be heard on your lips.
02Ex 23:14 "Celebrate a festival in My honor three times a year.
02Ex 23:15 Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I commanded you, you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, because you came out of Egypt in that month. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed.
02Ex 23:16 Also [observe] the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of your produce from what you sow in the field, and [observe] the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your produce from the field.
02Ex 23:17 Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord God.
02Ex 23:18 "You must not offer the blood of My sacrifices with anything leavened. The fat of My festival offering must not remain until morning.
02Ex 23:19 "Bring the best of the firstfruits of your land to the house of the LORD your God. "You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
02Ex 23:20 "I am going to send an Angel before you to protect you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared.
02Ex 23:21 Be attentive to Him and listen to His voice. Do not defy Him, because He will not forgive your acts of rebellion, for My name is in Him.
02Ex 23:22 But if you will carefully obey Him and do everything I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.
02Ex 23:23 For My Angel will go before you and bring you to [the land of] the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
02Ex 23:24 You must not bow down to their gods or worship them. Do not imitate their practices. Instead, demolish them and smash their sacred pillars to pieces.
02Ex 23:25 Worship the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. I will take away your illnesses.
02Ex 23:26 No woman will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give [you] the full number of your days.
02Ex 23:27 "I will cause the people ahead of you to feel terror and throw into confusion all the nations you come to. I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you in retreat.
02Ex 23:28 I will send the hornet in front of you, and it will drive the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites away from you.
02Ex 23:29 I will not drive them out ahead of you in a single year; otherwise, the land would become desolate, and wild animals would multiply against you.
02Ex 23:30 I will drive them out little by little ahead of you until you have become numerous and take possession of the land.
02Ex 23:31 I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River. For I will place the inhabitants of the land under your control, and you will drive them out ahead of you.
02Ex 23:32 You must not make a covenant with them or their gods.
02Ex 23:33 They must not remain in your land, or else they will make you sin against Me. If you worship their gods, it will be a snare for you."
02Ex 24:1 Then He said to Moses, "Go up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and 70 of Israel's elders, and bow in worship at a distance.
02Ex 24:2 Moses alone is to approach the LORD, but the others are not to approach, and the people are not to go up with him."
02Ex 24:3 Moses came and told the people all the commands of the LORD and all the ordinances. Then all the people responded with a single voice, "We will do everything that the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 24:4 And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early the next morning and set up an altar and 12 pillars for the 12 tribes of Israel at the base of the mountain.
02Ex 24:5 Then he sent out young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as fellowship offerings to the LORD.
02Ex 24:6 Moses took half the blood and set it in basins; the [other] half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
02Ex 24:7 He then took the covenant scroll and read [it] aloud to the people. They responded, "We will do and obey everything that the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 24:8 Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, "This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you concerning all these words."
02Ex 24:9 Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and 70 of Israel's elders,
02Ex 24:10 and they saw the God of Israel. Beneath His feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire stone, as clear as the sky itself.
02Ex 24:11 God did not harm the Israelite nobles; they saw Him, and they ate and drank.
02Ex 24:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and stay there so that I may give you the stone tablets with the law and commands I have written for their instruction."
02Ex 24:13 So Moses arose with his assistant Joshua, and went up the mountain of God.
02Ex 24:14 He told the elders, "Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are here with you. Whoever has a dispute should go to them."
02Ex 24:15 When Moses went up the mountain, the cloud covered it.
02Ex 24:16 The glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day He called to Moses from the cloud.
02Ex 24:17 The appearance of the LORD's glory to the Israelites was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop.
02Ex 24:18 Moses entered the cloud as he went up the mountain, and he remained on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights.
02Ex 25:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the Israelites to take an offering for Me. You are to take My offering from everyone whose heart stirs him [to give].
02Ex 25:3 This is the offering you are to receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze;
02Ex 25:4 blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;
02Ex 25:5 ram skins dyed red and manatee skins; acacia wood;
02Ex 25:6 oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02Ex 25:7 and onyx along with [other] gemstones for mounting on the ephod and breastpiece.
02Ex 25:8 "They are to make a sanctuary for Me so that I may dwell among them.
02Ex 25:9 You must make [it] according to all that I show you-- the design of the tabernacle as well as the design of all its furnishings."
02Ex 25:10 "They are to make an ark of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
02Ex 25:11 Overlay it with pure gold; overlay it both inside and out. Also make a gold molding all around it.
02Ex 25:12 Cast four gold rings for it and place [them] on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.
02Ex 25:13 Make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
02Ex 25:14 Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to carry the ark with them.
02Ex 25:15 The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed from it.
02Ex 25:16 Put the [tablets of the] testimony that I will give you into the ark.
02Ex 25:17 Make a mercy seat of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide.
02Ex 25:18 Make two cherubim of gold; make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat.
02Ex 25:19 Make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. Make the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends.

02Ex 29:21 Take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle [them] on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. In this way, he and his garments will become holy, as well as his sons and their garments.

02Ex 29:34 If any of the meat of ordination or any of the bread is left until morning, burn up what is left over. It must not be eaten because it is holy.
02Ex 29:35 "This is what you are to do for Aaron and his sons based on all I have commanded you. Ordain them for seven days.
02Ex 29:36 Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for atonement. Purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and anoint it in order to consecrate it.
02Ex 29:37 For seven days you must make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. The altar will become especially holy; whatever touches the altar will become holy.
02Ex 29:38 "This is what you are to offer regularly on the altar every day: two year-old lambs.
02Ex 29:39 In the morning offer one lamb, and at twilight offer the other lamb.
02Ex 29:40 With the first lamb offer two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of crushed olive oil, and a drink offering of one quart of wine.
02Ex 29:41 You are to offer the second lamb at twilight. Offer a grain offering and a drink offering with it, like the one in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD.
02Ex 29:42 This will be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak with you.
02Ex 29:43 I will also meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be consecrated by My glory.
02Ex 29:44 I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests.

02Ex 30:12 "When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, each of the men must pay a ransom for himself to the LORD as they are registered. Then no plague will come on them as they are registered.
02Ex 30:13 Everyone who is registered must pay half a shekel according to the sanctuary shekel
02Ex 30:14 Each man who is registered, 20 years old or more, must give this contribution to the LORD.
02Ex 30:15 The wealthy may not give more, and the poor may not give less, than half a shekel when giving the contribution to the LORD to atone for your lives.

02Ex 30:34 The LORD said to Moses: "Take fragrant spices: stacte, onycha, and galbanum; the spices and pure frankincense are to be in equal measures.
02Ex 30:35 Prepare expertly blended incense from these; it is to be seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
02Ex 30:36 Grind some of it into a fine powder and put some in front of the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It must be especially holy to you.
02Ex 30:37 As for the incense you are making, you must not make [any] for yourselves using its formula. It is to be regarded by you as sacred to the LORD.
02Ex 30:38 Anyone who makes something like it to smell its fragrance must be cut off from his people."
02Ex 31:1 The LORD also spoke to Moses:
02Ex 31:2 "Look, I have appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 31:3 I have filled him with God's Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every craft
02Ex 31:4 to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
02Ex 31:5 to cut gemstones for mounting, and to carve wood for work in every craft.
02Ex 31:6 I have also selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to be with him. I have placed wisdom within every skilled craftsman in order to make all that I have commanded you:
02Ex 31:7 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on top of it, and all the [other] furnishings of the tent--
02Ex 31:8 the table with its utensils, the pure [gold] lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
02Ex 31:9 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin with its stand--
02Ex 31:10 the specially woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,
02Ex 31:11 the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. They must make [them] according to all that I have commanded you."
02Ex 31:12 The LORD said to Moses:
02Ex 31:13 "Tell the Israelites: You must observe My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you will know that I am the LORD who sets you apart.
02Ex 31:14 Observe the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Whoever profanes it must be put to death. If anyone does work on it, that person must be cut off from his people.
02Ex 31:15 For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there must be a Sabbath of complete rest, dedicated to the LORD. Anyone who does work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.
02Ex 31:16 The Israelites must observe the Sabbath, celebrating it throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.
02Ex 31:17 It is a sign forever between Me and the Israelites, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed."
02Ex 31:18 When He finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God.
02Ex 32:1 When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, "Come, make us a god who will go before us because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt-- we don't know what has happened to him!"
02Ex 32:2 Then Aaron replied to them, "Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring [them] to me."
02Ex 32:3 So all the people took off the gold rings that were on their ears and brought [them] to Aaron.
02Ex 32:4 He took [the gold] from their hands, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it into an image of a calf. Then they said, "Israel, this is your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
02Ex 32:5 When Aaron saw [this], he built an altar before it; then he made an announcement: "There will be a festival to the LORD tomorrow."
02Ex 32:6 Early the next morning they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented fellowship offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink, then got up to revel.
02Ex 32:7 The LORD spoke to Moses: "Go down at once! For your people you brought up from the land of Egypt have acted corruptly.
02Ex 32:8 They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them; they have made for themselves an image of a calf. They have bowed down to it, sacrificed to it, and said, 'Israel, this is your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 32:9 The LORD also said to Moses: "I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.
02Ex 32:10 Now leave Me alone, so that My anger can burn against them and I can destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."
02Ex 32:11 But Moses interceded with the LORD his God: "LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand?
02Ex 32:12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'He brought them out with an evil intent to kill them in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from Your great anger and change Your mind about this disaster [planned] for Your people.
02Ex 32:13 Remember that You swore to Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel by Yourself and declared to them, 'I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and will give your offspring all this land that I have promised, and they will inherit [it] forever.'"
02Ex 32:14 So the LORD changed His mind about the disaster He said He would bring on His people.
02Ex 32:15 Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides-- inscribed front and back.
02Ex 32:16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was God's writing, engraved on the tablets.
02Ex 32:17 When Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp."
02Ex 32:18 But Moses replied: It's not the sound of a victory cry and not the sound of a cry of defeat; I hear the sound of singing!
02Ex 32:19 As he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became enraged and threw the tablets out of his hands, smashing them at the base of the mountain.
02Ex 32:20 Then he took the calf they had made, burned [it] up, and ground [it] to powder. He scattered [the powder] over the surface of the water and forced the Israelites to drink [the water].
02Ex 32:21 Then Moses asked Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have led them into [such] a grave sin?"
02Ex 32:22 "Don't be enraged, my lord," Aaron replied. "You yourself know that the people are [intent] on evil.
02Ex 32:23 They said to me, 'Make us a god who will go before us because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt-- we don't know what has happened to him!'
02Ex 32:24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, take it off,' and they gave [it] to me. When I threw it into the fire, out came this calf!"
02Ex 32:25 Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them get out of control, so that they would be vulnerable to their enemies.
02Ex 32:26 And Moses stood at the camp's entrance and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, [come] to me." And all the Levites gathered around him.
02Ex 32:27 He told them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'Every man fasten his sword to his side; go back and forth through the camp from entrance to entrance, and each of you kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.'"
02Ex 32:28 The Levites did as Moses commanded, and about 3,000 men fell dead that day among the people.
02Ex 32:29 Afterwards Moses said, "Today you have been dedicated to the LORD, since each man went against his son and his brother. Therefore you have brought a blessing on yourselves today."
02Ex 32:30 The following day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I will be able to pay for your sin."
02Ex 32:31 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Oh, this people has committed a great sin; they have made for themselves a god of gold.
02Ex 32:32 Now if You would only forgive their sin. But if not, please erase me from the book You have written."
02Ex 32:33 The LORD replied to Moses: "Whoever has sinned against Me I will erase from My book.
02Ex 32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about; see, My angel will go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will hold them accountable for their sin."
02Ex 32:35 And the LORD inflicted a plague on the people for what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
02Ex 33:1 The LORD spoke to Moses: "Go, leave here, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to your offspring.
02Ex 33:2 I will send an angel ahead of you and will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
02Ex 33:3 [Go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way."
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard this bad news, they mourned and didn't put on their jewelry.
02Ex 33:5 For the LORD said to Moses: "Tell the Israelites: You are a stiff-necked people. If I went with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you."
02Ex 33:6 So the Israelites stripped of their jewelry from Mount Horeb [onward].
02Ex 33:7 Now Moses took a tent and set it up outside the camp, far away from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. Anyone who wanted to consult the LORD would go to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.
02Ex 33:8 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand up, each one at the door of his tent, and they would watch Moses until he entered the tent.
02Ex 33:9 When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance to the tent, and [the LORD] would speak with Moses.
02Ex 33:10 As all the people saw the pillar of cloud remaining at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up, then bow in worship, each one at the door of his tent.
02Ex 33:11 The LORD spoke with Moses face to face, just as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his assistant, the young man Joshua son of Nun, would not leave the inside of the tent.
02Ex 33:12 Moses said to the LORD, "Look, You have told me, 'Lead this people up,' but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. You said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.'
02Ex 33:13 Now if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, please teach me Your ways, and I will know You and find favor in Your sight. Now consider that this nation is Your people."
02Ex 33:14 Then He replied, "My presence will go [with you], and I will give you rest."
02Ex 33:15 "If Your presence does not go," Moses responded to Him, "don't make us go up from here.
02Ex 33:16 How will it be known that I and Your people have found favor in Your sight unless You go with us? I and Your people will be distinguished [by this] from all the other people on the face of the earth."
02Ex 33:17 The LORD answered Moses, "I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name."
02Ex 33:18 Then Moses said, "Please, let me see Your glory."
02Ex 33:19 He said, "I will cause all My goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim the name Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
02Ex 33:20 But He answered, "You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live."
02Ex 33:21 The LORD said, "Here is a place near Me. You are to stand on the rock,
02Ex 33:22 and when My glory passes by, I will put you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
02Ex 33:23 Then I will take My hand away, and you will see My back, but My face will not be seen."
02Ex 34:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
02Ex 34:2 Be prepared by morning. Come up Mount Sinai in the morning and stand before Me on the mountaintop.
02Ex 34:3 No one may go up with you; in fact, no one must be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even the flocks and herds are not to graze in front of that mountain."
02Ex 34:4 Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones. He got up early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hand, he climbed Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 34:5 The LORD came down in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed [His] name Yahweh.
02Ex 34:6 Then the LORD passed in front of him and proclaimed: Yahweh-- Yahweh is a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in faithful love and truth,
02Ex 34:7 maintaining faithful love to a thousand [generations], forgiving wrongdoing, rebellion, and sin. But He will not leave [the guilty] unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers' wrongdoing on the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation.
02Ex 34:8 Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
02Ex 34:9 Then he said, "My Lord, if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Even though this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wrongdoing and sin, and accept us as Your own possession."
02Ex 34:10 And the LORD responded: "Look, I am making a covenant. I will perform wonders in the presence of all your people that have never been done in all the earth or in any nation. All the people you live among will see the LORD's work, for what I am doing with you is awe-inspiring.
02Ex 34:11 Observe what I command you today. I am going to drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
02Ex 34:12 Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land that you are going to enter; otherwise, they will become a snare among you.
02Ex 34:13 Instead, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, and chop down their Asherah poles.
02Ex 34:14 You are to never bow down to another god because the LORD, being jealous by nature, is a jealous God.
02Ex 34:15 "Do not make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land, or else when they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, they will invite you, and you will eat of their sacrifice.
02Ex 34:16 Then you will take some of their daughters [as brides] for your sons. Their daughters will prostitute themselves with their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods.
02Ex 34:17 "Do not make cast images of gods for yourselves.
02Ex 34:18 "Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib as I commanded you. For you came out of Egypt in the month of Abib.
02Ex 34:19 "The firstborn male from every womb belongs to Me, including all your male livestock, the firstborn of cattle or sheep.
02Ex 34:20 You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a sheep, but if you do not redeem [it], break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed.
02Ex 34:21 "You are to labor six days but you must rest on the seventh day; you must even rest during plowing and harvesting times.
02Ex 34:22 "Observe the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the [agricultural] year.
02Ex 34:23 Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.
02Ex 34:24 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory. No one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
02Ex 34:25 "Do not present the blood for My sacrifice with anything leavened. The sacrifice of the Passover Festival must not remain until morning.
02Ex 34:26 "Bring the best firstfruits of your land to the house of the LORD your God. "You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
02Ex 34:27 The LORD also said to Moses, "Write down these words, for I have made a covenant with you and with Israel based on these words."
02Ex 34:28 Moses was there with the LORD 40 days and 40 nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. He wrote down on the tablets the words of the covenant-- the Ten Commandments.
02Ex 34:29 As Moses descended from Mount Sinai-- with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands as he descended the mountain-- he did not realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the LORD.
02Ex 34:30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone! They were afraid to come near him.
02Ex 34:31 But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.
02Ex 34:32 Afterwards all the Israelites came near, and he commanded them everything the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.
02Ex 34:33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
02Ex 34:34 But whenever Moses went before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. After he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded,
02Ex 34:35 and the Israelites would see that Moses' face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil over his face again until he went to speak with the LORD.
02Ex 35:1 Moses assembled the entire Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:
02Ex 35:2 For six days work is to be done, but on the seventh day you are to have a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD. Anyone who does work on it must be executed.
02Ex 35:3 Do not light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day."
02Ex 35:4 Then Moses said to the entire Israelite community, "This is what the LORD has commanded:
02Ex 35:5 Take up an offering for the LORD among you. Let everyone whose heart is willing bring this as the LORD's offering: gold, silver, and bronze;
02Ex 35:6 blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;
02Ex 35:7 ram skins dyed red and manatee skins; acacia wood;
02Ex 35:8 oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02Ex 35:9 and onyx with gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece.
02Ex 35:10 "Let all the skilled craftsmen among you come and make everything that the LORD has commanded:
02Ex 35:11 the tabernacle-- its tent and covering, its clasps and planks, its crossbars, its posts and bases;
02Ex 35:12 the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil for the screen;
02Ex 35:13 the table with its poles, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 35:14 the lampstand for light with its utensils and lamps as well as the oil for the light;
02Ex 35:15 the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the entryway screen for the entrance to the tabernacle;
02Ex 35:16 the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
02Ex 35:17 the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and bases, and the screen for the gate of the courtyard;
02Ex 35:18 the tent pegs for the tabernacle and the tent pegs for the courtyard, along with their ropes;
02Ex 35:19 and the specially woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary-- the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests."
02Ex 35:20 Then the entire Israelite community left Moses' presence.
02Ex 35:21 Everyone whose heart was moved and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the LORD to construct the tent of meeting for every use, and [to make] the holy garments.
02Ex 35:22 Both men and women came; all who had willing hearts brought brooches, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry-- everyone who waved a presentation offering of gold to the LORD.
02Ex 35:23 Everyone who had in his possession blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, fine linen or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or manatee skins, brought [them].
02Ex 35:24 Everyone who offered a contribution of silver or bronze brought it to the LORD. Everyone who possessed acacia wood useful for any task in the work brought [it].
02Ex 35:25 Every skilled woman spun [yarn] with her hands and brought it: blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
02Ex 35:26 And all the women whose hearts were moved spun the goat hair by virtue of [their] skill.
02Ex 35:27 The leaders brought onyx and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece,
02Ex 35:28 as well as the spice and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
02Ex 35:29 So the Israelites brought a freewill offering to the LORD, all the men and women whose hearts prompted them to bring [something] for all the work that the LORD, through Moses, had commanded to be done.
02Ex 35:30 Moses then said to the Israelites: "Look, the LORD has appointed by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 35:31 He has filled him with God's Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every kind of craft
02Ex 35:32 to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
02Ex 35:33 to cut gemstones for mounting, and to carve wood for work in every kind of artistic craft.
02Ex 35:34 He has also given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, [the ability] to teach [others].
02Ex 35:35 He has filled them with skill to do all the work of a gem cutter; a designer; an embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen; and a weaver. They can do every kind of craft and design artistic designs.
02Ex 36:1 Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the skilled people are to work based on everything the LORD has commanded. The LORD has given them wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work of constructing the sanctuary."
02Ex 36:2 So Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person in whose heart the LORD had placed wisdom, everyone whose heart moved him, to come to the work and do it.
02Ex 36:3 They took from Moses' presence all the contributions that the Israelites had brought for the task of making the sanctuary. Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
02Ex 36:4 Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work for the sanctuary came one by one from the work they were doing
02Ex 36:5 and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than is needed for the construction of the work the LORD commanded to be done."
02Ex 36:6 After Moses gave an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: "Let no man or woman make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." So the people stopped.
02Ex 36:7 The materials were sufficient for them to do all the work. There was more than enough.
02Ex 36:8 All the skilled craftsmen among those doing the work made the tabernacle with 10 curtains. Bezalel made them of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with a design of cherubim worked into them.
02Ex 36:9 The length of each curtain was 42 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet; all the curtains had the same measurements.
02Ex 36:10 He joined five of the curtains to each other, and the [other] five curtains he joined to each other.
02Ex 36:11 He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the last curtain in the first set and did the same on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.
02Ex 36:12 He made 50 loops on the one curtain and 50 loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set, so that the loops lined up with each other.
02Ex 36:13 He also made 50 gold clasps and joined the curtains to each other, so that the tabernacle became a single unit.
02Ex 36:14 He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he also made 11 of them.
02Ex 36:15 The length of each curtain was 45 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet. All 11 curtains had the same measurements.
02Ex 36:16 He joined five of the curtains together, and [the other] six together.
02Ex 36:17 He made 50 loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the [first] set and 50 loops on the edge of the [corresponding] curtain in the second set.
02Ex 36:18 He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together as a single unit.
02Ex 36:19 He also made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red and a covering of manatee skins on top of it.
02Ex 36:20 He made upright planks of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:21 The length of each plank was 15 feet, and the width of each was 27 inches.
02Ex 36:22 There were two tenons connected to each other for each plank. He did the same for all the planks of the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:23 He made planks for the tabernacle as follows: 20 for the south side,
02Ex 36:24 and he made 40 silver bases to put under the 20 planks, two bases under the first plank for its two tenons, and two bases under each of the following planks for their two tenons;
02Ex 36:25 for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made 20 planks,
02Ex 36:26 with their 40 silver bases, two bases under the first plank and two bases under each of the following ones;
02Ex 36:27 and for the west side of the tabernacle he made six planks.
02Ex 36:28 He also made two additional planks for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:29 They were paired at the bottom and joined together at the top in a single ring. This is what he did with both of them for the two corners.
02Ex 36:30 So there were eight planks with their 16 silver bases, two bases under each one.
02Ex 36:31 He made five crossbars of acacia wood for the planks on one side of the tabernacle,
02Ex 36:32 five crossbars for the planks on the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for those at the back of the tabernacle on the west.
02Ex 36:33 He made the central crossbar run through the middle of the planks from one end to the other.
02Ex 36:34 He overlaid them with gold and made their rings and holders for the crossbars out of gold. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
02Ex 36:35 Then he made the veil with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. He made it with a design of cherubim worked into it.
02Ex 36:36 For it he made four posts of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold. And he cast four silver bases for the posts.
02Ex 36:37 He made a screen embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen for the entrance to the tent,
02Ex 36:38 together with its five posts and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, but their five bases were bronze.
02Ex 37:1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
02Ex 37:2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out and made a gold molding all around it.
02Ex 37:3 He cast four gold rings for it to be on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.
02Ex 37:4 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:5 He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark for carrying the ark.
02Ex 37:6 He made a mercy seat of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide.
02Ex 37:7 He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat,
02Ex 37:8 one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. He made the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat, [a cherubim] at each end.
02Ex 37:9 They had wings spread out, covering the mercy seat with their wings and facing each other. The faces of the cherubim were looking toward the mercy seat.
02Ex 37:10 He constructed the table of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high.
02Ex 37:11 He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding all around it.
02Ex 37:12 He made a three-inch frame all around it and made a gold molding all around its frame.
02Ex 37:13 He cast four gold rings for it and attached the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
02Ex 37:14 The rings were next to the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table.
02Ex 37:15 He made the poles for carrying the table from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:16 He also made the utensils that would be on the table out of pure gold: its plates and cups, as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings.
02Ex 37:17 Then he made the lampstand out of pure hammered gold. He made it [all] of one piece: its base and shaft, its [ornamental] cups, and its calyxes and petals.
02Ex 37:18 Six branches extended from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from one side and three branches of the lampstand from the other side.
02Ex 37:19 There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a calyx and petals, on the first branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a calyx and petals, on the next branch. It was this way for the six branches that extended from the lampstand.
02Ex 37:20 On the lampstand shaft there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms with its calyxes and petals.
02Ex 37:21 For the six branches that extended from it, a calyx was under the first pair of branches from it, a calyx under the second pair of branches from it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches from it.
02Ex 37:22 Their calyxes and branches were of one piece. All of it was a single hammered piece of pure gold.
02Ex 37:23 He also made its seven lamps, snuffers, and firepans of pure gold.
02Ex 37:24 He made it and all its utensils of 75 pounds of pure gold.
02Ex 37:25 He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide; it was 36 inches high. Its horns were of one piece.
02Ex 37:26 He overlaid it, its top, all around its sides, and its horns with pure gold. Then he made a gold molding all around it.
02Ex 37:27 He made two gold rings for it under the molding on two of its sides; [he put these] on opposite sides of it to be holders for the poles to carry it with.
02Ex 37:28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:29 He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant, and expertly blended incense.
02Ex 38:1 Bezalel constructed the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood. It was square, seven and a half feet long and seven and a half feet wide, and was four and a half feet high.
02Ex 38:2 He made horns for it on its four corners; the horns were of one piece. Then he overlaid it with bronze.
02Ex 38:3 He made all the altar's utensils: the pots, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze.
02Ex 38:4 He constructed for the altar a grate of bronze mesh under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom.
02Ex 38:5 At the four corners of the bronze grate he cast four rings as holders for the poles.
02Ex 38:6 He also made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
02Ex 38:7 Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar in order to carry it with them. He constructed the altar with boards so that it was hollow.
02Ex 38:8 He made the bronze basin and its stand from the [bronze] mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
02Ex 38:9 Then he made the courtyard. The hangings on the south side of the courtyard were of finely spun linen, 150 feet in length,
02Ex 38:10 including their 20 posts and 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.
02Ex 38:11 [The hangings] on the north side were also 150 feet in length, including their 20 posts and 20 bronze bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.

02Ex 38:17 The bases for the posts were bronze; the hooks and bands of the posts were silver; and the plating for the tops of the posts was silver. All the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver.
02Ex 38:18 The screen for the gate of the courtyard was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It was 30 feet long, and like the hangings of the courtyard, seven and a half feet high.
02Ex 38:19 It had four posts, including their four bronze bases. Their hooks were silver, and the bands as well as the plating of their tops were silver.
02Ex 38:20 All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
02Ex 38:21 This is the inventory for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, that was recorded at Moses' command. It was the work of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
02Ex 38:22 Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 38:23 With him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a gem cutter, a designer, and an embroiderer with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
02Ex 38:24 All the gold of the presentation offering that was used for the project in all the work on the sanctuary, was 2,193 pounds, according to the sanctuary shekel.
02Ex 38:25 The silver from those of the community who were registered was 7,544 pounds, according to the sanctuary shekel--
02Ex 38:26 two-fifths of an ounce per man, that is, half a shekel according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone 20 years old or more who had crossed over to the registered group, 603,550 men.
02Ex 38:27 There were 7,500 pounds of silver [used] to cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil-- 100 bases from 7,500 pounds, 75 pounds for each base.
02Ex 38:28 With the [remaining] 44 pounds he made the hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and supplied bands for them.
02Ex 38:29 The bronze of the presentation offering totaled 5,310 pounds.
02Ex 38:30 He made with it the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar and its bronze grate, all the utensils for the altar,
02Ex 38:31 the bases for the surrounding courtyard, the bases for the gate of the courtyard, all the tent pegs for the tabernacle, and all the tent pegs for the surrounding courtyard.
02Ex 39:1 They made specially woven garments for ministry in the sanctuary, and the holy garments for Aaron from the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:2 Bezalel made the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely spun linen.
02Ex 39:3 They hammered out thin sheets of gold, and he cut threads [from them] to interweave with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen in a skillful design.
02Ex 39:4 They made shoulder pieces for attaching it; it was joined together at its two edges.
02Ex 39:5 The artistically woven waistband that was on the ephod was of one piece with the ephod, according to the same workmanship of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely spun linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:6 Then they mounted the onyx stones surrounded with gold filigree settings, engraved with the names of Israel's sons as a gem cutter engraves a seal.
02Ex 39:7 He fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:8 He also made the embroidered breastpiece with the same workmanship as the ephod of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely spun linen.
02Ex 39:9 They made the breastpiece square and folded double, nine inches long and nine inches wide.
02Ex 39:10 They mounted four rows of gemstones on it. The first row was a row of carnelian, topaz, and emerald;
02Ex 39:11 the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
02Ex 39:12 the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
02Ex 39:13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were surrounded with gold filigree in their settings.
02Ex 39:14 The 12 stones corresponded to the names of Israel's sons. Each stone was engraved like a seal with one of the names of the 12 tribes.
02Ex 39:15 They made braided chains of pure gold cord for the breastpiece.
02Ex 39:16 They also fashioned two gold filigree settings and two gold rings and attached the two rings to its two corners.
02Ex 39:17 Then they attached the two gold cords to the two gold rings on the corners of the breastpiece.
02Ex 39:18 They attached the other ends of the two cords to the two filigree settings and, in this way, attached [them] to the ephod's shoulder pieces in front.
02Ex 39:19 They made two [other] gold rings and put [them] at the two other corners of the breastpiece on the edge that is next to the inner border of the ephod.
02Ex 39:20 They made two [more] gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the ephod's two shoulder pieces on its front, close to its seam, above the ephod's woven waistband.
02Ex 39:21 Then they tied the breastpiece from its rings to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece was above the ephod's waistband and did not come loose from the ephod. [They did] just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:22 They made the woven robe of the ephod entirely of blue yarn.
02Ex 39:23 There was an opening in the center of the robe like that for body armor with a collar around the opening so that it would not tear.
02Ex 39:24 They made pomegranates of finely spun blue, purple, and scarlet yarn on the lower hem of the robe.
02Ex 39:25 They made bells of pure gold and attached the bells between the pomegranates, all around the hem of the robe between the pomegranates,
02Ex 39:26 a bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the lower hem of the robe. It is to be used for ministry, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:27 They made the tunics of fine woven linen for Aaron and his sons.
02Ex 39:28 [They also made] the turban and the ornate headbands of fine linen, the undergarments,
02Ex 39:29 and the sash of finely spun linen of embroidered blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. [They did] just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:30 They also made a plate, the holy diadem, out of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engraving on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD
02Ex 39:31 Then they attached a cord of blue yarn to it in order to mount [it] on the turban, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:32 So all the work for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was finished. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent with all its furnishings, its clasps, its planks, its crossbars, and its posts and bases;
02Ex 39:34 the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of manatee skins; the veil for the screen;
02Ex 39:35 the ark of the testimony with its poles and the mercy seat;
02Ex 39:36 the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 39:37 the pure [gold] lampstand, with its lamps arranged and all its utensils, as well as the oil for the light;
02Ex 39:38 the gold altar; the anointing oil; the fragrant incense; the screen for the entrance to the tent;
02Ex 39:39 the bronze altar with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
02Ex 39:40 the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and bases, the screen for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and tent pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;
02Ex 39:41 and the specially woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.
02Ex 39:42 The Israelites had done all the work according to everything the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:43 Moses inspected all the work they had accomplished. They had done just as the LORD commanded. Then Moses blessed them.
02Ex 40:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
02Ex 40:2 "You are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, on the first day of the first month.
02Ex 40:3 Put the ark of the testimony there, and screen off the ark with the veil.
02Ex 40:4 Then bring in the table and lay out its arrangement; also bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
02Ex 40:5 Place the gold altar for incense in front of the ark of the testimony. Put up the screen for the entrance to the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:6 Position the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.
02Ex 40:7 Place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
02Ex 40:8 Assemble the surrounding courtyard and hang the screen for the gate of the courtyard.
02Ex 40:9 "Take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it along with all its furnishings so that it will be holy.
02Ex 40:10 Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar so that it will be especially holy.
02Ex 40:11 Anoint the basin and its stand, and consecrate it.
02Ex 40:12 "Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
02Ex 40:13 Clothe Aaron with the holy garments, anoint him, and consecrate him, so that he can serve Me as a priest.
02Ex 40:14 Have his sons come forward and clothe them in tunics.
02Ex 40:15 Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will serve to inaugurate a permanent priesthood for them throughout their generations."
02Ex 40:16 Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:17 The tabernacle was set up in the first month of the second year, on the first [day] of the month.
02Ex 40:18 Moses set up the tabernacle: he laid its bases, positioned its planks, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts.
02Ex 40:19 Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:20 Moses took the testimony and placed [it] in the ark, and attached the poles to the ark. He set the mercy seat on top of the ark.
02Ex 40:21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:22 Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
02Ex 40:23 He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:24 He also put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
02Ex 40:25 and set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:26 Moses also installed the gold altar in the tent of meeting, in front of the veil,
02Ex 40:27 and burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:28 He put up the screen at the entrance to the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:29 Then he placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered the burnt offering and the grain offering on it, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:30 He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.
02Ex 40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet from it.
02Ex 40:32 They washed whenever they came to the tent of meeting and approached the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:33 Next Moses set up the surrounding courtyard for the tabernacle and the altar and hung a screen for the gate of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
02Ex 40:34 The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:35 Moses was unable to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud rested on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:36 The Israelites set out whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle throughout all the stages of their journey.
02Ex 40:37 If the cloud was not taken up, they did not set out until the day it was taken up.
02Ex 40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and there was a fire inside the cloud by night, visible to the entire house of Israel throughout all the stages of their journey.

03Lv 1:1 Then the LORD summoned Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting:
03Lv 1:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the LORD from the livestock, you may bring your offering from the herd or the flock.
03Lv 1:3 "If his gift is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to bring an unblemished male. He must bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting so that he may be accepted by the LORD.
03Lv 1:4 He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering so it can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
03Lv 1:5 He is to slaughter the bull before the LORD; Aaron's sons the priests are to present the blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 1:6 Then he must skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
03Lv 1:7 The sons of Aaron the priest will prepare a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
03Lv 1:8 Aaron's sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, the head, and the suet on top of the burning wood on the altar.
03Lv 1:9 The offerer must wash its entrails and shanks with water. Then the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 1:10 "But if his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from sheep or goats, he is to present an unblemished male.
03Lv 1:11 He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD. Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle its blood against the altar on all sides.
03Lv 1:12 He will cut it into pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest will arrange them on top of the burning wood on the altar.
03Lv 1:13 But he is to wash the entrails and shanks with water. The priest will then present all of it and burn [it] on the altar; it is a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 1:14 "If his gift to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, he is to present his offering from the turtledoves or young pigeons.
03Lv 1:15 Then the priest must bring it to the altar, and must twist off its head and burn [it] on the altar; its blood should be drained at the side of the altar.
03Lv 1:16 He will remove its digestive tract, cutting off the tail feathers, and throw it on the east side of the altar at the place for ashes.
03Lv 1:17 He will tear it open by its wings without dividing [the bird]. Then the priest is to burn it on the altar on top of the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 2:1 "When anyone presents a grain offering as a gift to the LORD, his gift must consist of fine flour. He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it,
03Lv 2:2 and bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. The priest will take a handful of fine flour and oil from it, along with all its frankincense, and will burn this memorial portion of it on the altar, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 2:3 But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons, the holiest part of the fire offerings to the LORD.
03Lv 2:4 "When you present a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be [made] of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil.
03Lv 2:5 If your gift is a grain offering prepared on the griddle, it must be unleavened bread [made] of fine flour mixed with oil.
03Lv 2:6 Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
03Lv 2:7 If your gift is a grain offering [prepared] in a pan, it must be made of fine flour with oil.
03Lv 2:8 When you bring to the LORD the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he will take it to the altar.
03Lv 2:9 The priest will remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 2:10 But the rest of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons, the holiest part of the fire offerings to the LORD.
03Lv 2:11 "No grain offering that you present to the LORD is to be made with yeast, for you are not to burn any yeast or honey as a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 2:12 You may present them to the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
03Lv 2:13 You are to season each of your grain offerings with salt; you must not omit from your grain offering the salt of the covenant with your God. You are to present salt with each of your offerings.
03Lv 2:14 "If you present a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you must present fresh heads of grain, crushed kernels, roasted on the fire, for your grain offering of firstfruits.
03Lv 2:15 You are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
03Lv 2:16 The priest will then burn some of its crushed kernels and oil with all its frankincense as a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 3:1 "If his offering is a fellowship sacrifice, and he is presenting [an animal] from the herd, whether male or female, he must present one without blemish before the LORD.
03Lv 3:2 He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting. Then Aaron's sons the priests will sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 3:3 He will present part of the fellowship sacrifice as a fire offering to the LORD: the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat that is on the entrails,
03Lv 3:4 and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
03Lv 3:5 Aaron's sons will burn it on the altar along with the burnt offering that is on the burning wood, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 3:6 "If his offering as a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD is from the flock, he must present a male or female without blemish.
03Lv 3:7 If he is presenting a lamb for his offering, he is to present it before the LORD.
03Lv 3:8 He must lay his hand on the head of his offering, then slaughter it before the tent of meeting. Aaron's sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 3:9 He will then present part of the fellowship sacrifice as a fire offering to the LORD [consisting of] its fat and the entire fat tail, which he is to remove close to the backbone. He will also remove the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat on the entrails,
03Lv 3:10 the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins, and the fatty lobe of the liver above the kidneys.
03Lv 3:11 Then the priest will burn it on the altar as food, a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 3:12 "If his offering is a goat, he is to present it before the LORD.
03Lv 3:13 He must lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the tent of meeting. Aaron's sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 3:14 He will present part of his offering as a fire offering to the LORD: the fat surrounding the entrails, all the fat that is on the entrails,
03Lv 3:15 and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
03Lv 3:16 Then the priest will burn them on the altar as food, a fire offering for a pleasing aroma. "All fat belongs to the LORD.
03Lv 3:17 This is a permanent statute throughout your generations, wherever you live: you must not eat any fat or any blood."
03Lv 4:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 4:2 "Tell the Israelites: When someone sins unintentionally against any of the LORD's commands and does anything prohibited by them--
03Lv 4:3 "If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he is to present to the LORD a young, unblemished bull as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
03Lv 4:4 He must bring the bull to the entrance to the tent of meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull's head, and slaughter it before the LORD.
03Lv 4:5 The anointed priest must then take some of the bull's blood and bring it into the tent of meeting.
03Lv 4:6 The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
03Lv 4:7 The priest must apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. He must pour out the rest of the bull's blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 4:8 He is to remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering: the fat surrounding the entrails; all the fat that is on the entrails;
03Lv 4:9 and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins. He will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys,
03Lv 4:10 just as the fat is removed from the ox of the fellowship sacrifice. The priest is to burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
03Lv 4:11 But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and shanks, and its entrails and dung--
03Lv 4:12 all [the rest] of the bull-- he must bring to a ceremonially clean place outside the camp to the ash heap, and must burn it on a wood fire. It is to be burned at the ash heap.
03Lv 4:13 "Now if the whole community of Israel errs, and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, so that they violate any of the LORD's commands and incur guilt by doing what is prohibited,
03Lv 4:14 then the assembly must present a young bull as a sin offering. When the sin they have committed in regard to the command becomes known, they are to bring it before the tent of meeting.
03Lv 4:15 The elders of the assembly are to lay their hands on the bull's head before the LORD and it is to be slaughtered before the LORD.
03Lv 4:16 The anointed priest will bring some of the bull's blood into the tent of meeting.
03Lv 4:17 The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle [it] seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
03Lv 4:18 He is to apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the tent of meeting. He must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 4:19 He is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.
03Lv 4:20 He is to offer this bull just as he did with the bull in the sin offering; he will offer it the same way. So the priest will make atonement on their behalf, and they will be forgiven.
03Lv 4:21 Then he will bring the bull outside the camp and burn it just as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly.
03Lv 4:22 "When a leader sins and unintentionally violates any of the commands of the LORD his God by doing what is prohibited, and incurs guilt,
03Lv 4:23 or someone informs him about the sin he has committed, he is to bring an unblemished male goat as his offering.
03Lv 4:24 He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.
03Lv 4:25 Then the priest must take some of the blood from the sin offering with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. The rest of its blood he must pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
03Lv 4:26 He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the fellowship sacrifice. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for that person's sin, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 4:27 "Now if any of the common people sins unintentionally by violating one of the LORD's commands, does what is prohibited, and incurs guilt,
03Lv 4:28 or if someone informs him about the sin he has committed, then he is to bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for the sin that he has committed.
03Lv 4:29 He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
03Lv 4:30 Then the priest must take some of its blood with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He must pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
03Lv 4:31 He is to remove all its fat just as the fat is removed from the fellowship sacrifice. The priest is to burn [it] on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 4:32 "Or if the offering that he brings as a sin offering is a lamb, he is to bring an unblemished female.
03Lv 4:33 He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
03Lv 4:34 Then the priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering. He must pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
03Lv 4:35 He is to remove all its fat just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the fellowship sacrifice. The priest will burn it on the altar along with the fire offerings to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:1 "When someone sins [in any of these ways]: [If] he has seen, heard, or known about something he has witnessed, and did not respond to a public call to testify, he is guilty.
03Lv 5:2 Or [if] someone touches anything unclean-- a carcass of an unclean wild animal, or unclean livestock, or an unclean swarming creature-- without being aware of it, he is unclean and guilty.
03Lv 5:3 Or [if] he touches human uncleanness-- any uncleanness by which one can become defiled-- without being aware of it, but [later] recognizes [it], he is guilty.
03Lv 5:4 Or [if] someone swears rashly to do what is good or evil-- concerning anything a person may speak rashly in an oath-- without being aware of it, but [later] recognizes it, he incurs guilt in such an instance.
03Lv 5:5 If someone incurs guilt in one of these cases, he is to confess he has committed that sin.
03Lv 5:6 He must bring his restitution for the sin he has committed to the LORD: a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for his sin.
03Lv 5:7 "But if he cannot afford an animal from the flock, then he may bring to the LORD two turtledoves or two young pigeons as restitution for his sin-- one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
03Lv 5:8 He is to bring them to the priest, who will first present the one for the sin offering. He must twist its head at the back of the neck without severing [it].
03Lv 5:9 Then he will sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood is to be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
03Lv 5:10 He must prepare the second [bird] as a burnt offering according to the regulation. In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:11 "But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he may bring two quarts of fine flour as an offering for his sin. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
03Lv 5:12 He is to bring it to the priest, who will take a handful from it as its memorial portion and burn [it] on the altar along with the fire offerings to the LORD; it is a sin offering.
03Lv 5:13 In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf concerning the sin he has committed in any of these cases, and he will be forgiven. The rest will belong to the priest, like the grain offering."
03Lv 5:14 Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 5:15 "If someone offends by sinning unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD's holy things, he must bring his restitution offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock by your valuation in silver shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel, as a restitution offering.
03Lv 5:16 He must make restitution for his sin regarding any holy thing, adding a fifth of its value to it, and give it to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf with the ram of the restitution offering, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:17 "If someone sins and without knowing [it] violates any of the LORD's commands concerning anything prohibited, he bears the consequences of his guilt.
03Lv 5:18 He must bring an unblemished ram from the flock according to your valuation as a restitution offering to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the error he has committed unintentionally, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:19 It is a restitution offering; he is indeed guilty before the LORD."
03Lv 6:1  The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 6:2 "When someone sins and offends the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in regard to a deposit, a security, or a robbery; or defrauds his neighbor;
03Lv 6:3 or finds something lost and lies about it; or swears falsely about any of the sinful things a person may do--
03Lv 6:4 once he has sinned and acknowledged [his] guilt-- he must return what he stole or defrauded, or the deposit entrusted to him, or the lost item he found,
03Lv 6:5 or anything else about which he swore falsely. He must make full restitution for it and add a fifth of its value to it. He is to pay it to its owner on the day he acknowledges [his] guilt.
03Lv 6:6 Then he must bring his restitution offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock, according to your valuation, as a restitution offering to the priest.
03Lv 6:7 In this way the priest will make atonement on his behalf before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done to incur guilt."
03Lv 6:8  The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 6:9 "Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the burnt offering; the burnt offering itself must remain on the altar's hearth all night until morning, while the fire of the altar is kept burning on it.
03Lv 6:10 The priest is to put on his linen robe and linen undergarments. He is to remove the ashes of the burnt offering the fire has consumed on the altar, and place them beside the altar.
03Lv 6:11 Then he must take off his garments, put on other clothes, and bring the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.
03Lv 6:12 The fire on the altar is to be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest will burn wood on the fire. He is to arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat portions from the fellowship offerings on it.
03Lv 6:13 Fire must be kept burning on the altar continually; it must not go out.
03Lv 6:14 "Now this is the law of the grain offering: Aaron's sons will present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
03Lv 6:15 The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil from the grain offering, with all the frankincense that is on the offering, and burn its memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 6:16 Aaron and his sons may eat the rest of it. It is to be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
03Lv 6:17 It must not be baked with yeast; I have assigned it as their portion from My fire offerings. It is especially holy, like the sin offering and the restitution offering.
03Lv 6:18 Any male among Aaron's descendants may eat it. It is a permanent portion throughout your generations from the fire offerings to the Lord. Anything that touches the offerings will become holy."
03Lv 6:19 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 6:20 "This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the day that he is anointed: two quarts of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
03Lv 6:21 It is to be prepared with oil on a griddle; you are to bring it well-kneaded. You must present it as a grain offering of baked pieces, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 6:22 The priest, who is of Aaron's sons and will be anointed to take his place, is to prepare it. It must be completely burned as a permanent portion for the LORD.
03Lv 6:23 Every grain offering for a priest will be a whole burnt offering; it is not to be eaten."
03Lv 6:24 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 6:25 "Tell Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the sin offering. The sin offering is most holy and must be slaughtered before the LORD at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
03Lv 6:26 The priest who offers it as a sin offering is to eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.
03Lv 6:27 Anything that touches its flesh will become holy, and if any of its blood spatters on a garment, then you must wash that garment in a holy place.
03Lv 6:28 A clay pot in which the sin offering is boiled must be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it must be scoured and rinsed with water.
03Lv 6:29 Any male among the priests may eat it; it is especially holy.
03Lv 6:30 But no sin offering may be eaten if its blood has been brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place; it must be burned up.
03Lv 7:1 "Now this is the law of the restitution offering; it is especially holy.
03Lv 7:2 The restitution offering must be slaughtered at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest is to sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 7:3 The offerer must present all the fat from it: the fat tail, the fat surrounding the entrails,
03Lv 7:4 and the two kidneys with the fat on them at the loins; he will also remove the fatty lobe of the liver with the kidneys.
03Lv 7:5 The priest will burn them on the altar as a fire offering to the LORD; it is a restitution offering.
03Lv 7:6 Any male among the priests may eat it. It is to be eaten in a holy place; it is especially holy.
03Lv 7:7 "The restitution offering is like the sin offering; the law is the same for both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.
03Lv 7:8 As for the priest who presents someone's burnt offering, the hide of the burnt offering he has presented belongs to him; it is the priest's.
03Lv 7:9 Any grain offering that is baked in an oven, or prepared in a pan or on a griddle, belongs to the priest who presents it; it is his.
03Lv 7:10 But any grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all of Aaron's sons.
03Lv 7:11 "Now this is the law of the fellowship sacrifice that someone may present to the LORD:
03Lv 7:12 If he presents it for thanksgiving, in addition to the thanksgiving sacrifice, he is to present unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.
03Lv 7:13 He is to present as his offering cakes of leavened bread, with his thanksgiving sacrifice of fellowship.
03Lv 7:14 From the cakes he must present one [portion] of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offering; it is his.
03Lv 7:15 The meat of his thanksgiving sacrifice of fellowship must be eaten on the day he offers it; he may not leave any of it until morning.
03Lv 7:16 "If the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it is to be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, and what is left over may be eaten on the next day.
03Lv 7:17 But what remains of the sacrificial meat by the third day must be burned up.
03Lv 7:18 If any of the meat of his fellowship sacrifice is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presents it; it is repulsive. The person who eats any of it will be guilty.
03Lv 7:19 "Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. Everyone who is clean may eat any [other] meat.
03Lv 7:20 But the one who eats meat from the LORD's fellowship sacrifice while he is unclean, that person must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 7:21 If someone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable creature, and eats meat from the LORD's fellowship sacrifice, that person must be cut off from his people."
03Lv 7:22 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 7:23 "Tell the Israelites: You are not to eat any fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat.
03Lv 7:24 The fat of an animal that dies naturally or is mauled by wild beasts may be used for any purpose, but you must not eat it.
03Lv 7:25 If anyone eats animal fat from a fire offering presented to the LORD, the person who eats [it] must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 7:26 Wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.
03Lv 7:27 Whoever eats any blood, that person must be cut off from his people."
03Lv 7:28 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 7:29 "Tell the Israelites: The one who presents a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD must bring an offering to the LORD from his sacrifice.
03Lv 7:30 His own hands will bring the fire offerings to the LORD. He will bring the fat together with the breast. The breast is to be waved as a presentation offering before the LORD.
03Lv 7:31 The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
03Lv 7:32 You are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your fellowship sacrifices.
03Lv 7:33 The son of Aaron who presents the blood of the fellowship offering and the fat will have the right thigh as a portion.
03Lv 7:34 I have taken from the Israelites the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution from their fellowship sacrifices, and have assigned them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the Israelites."
03Lv 7:35 This is the portion from the fire offerings to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
03Lv 7:36 The LORD commanded this to be given to them by the Israelites on the day He anointed them. It is a permanent portion throughout their generations.
03Lv 7:37 This is the law for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the restitution offering, the ordination offering, and the fellowship sacrifice,
03Lv 7:38 which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.
03Lv 8:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 8:2 "Take Aaron, his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
03Lv 8:3 and assemble the whole community at the entrance to the tent of meeting."
03Lv 8:4 So Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the community assembled at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 8:5 Moses said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded to be done."
03Lv 8:6 Then Moses presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
03Lv 8:7 He put the tunic on Aaron, wrapped the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He put the woven band of the ephod around him and fastened it to him.
03Lv 8:8 Then he put the breastpiece on him and placed the Urim and Thummim into the breastpiece.
03Lv 8:9 He also put the turban on his head and placed the plate of gold, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate them.
03Lv 8:11 He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
03Lv 8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed and consecrated him.
03Lv 8:13 Then Moses presented Aaron's sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes around them, and fastened headbands on them, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:14 Then he brought the bull near for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering.
03Lv 8:15 Then Moses slaughtered [it], took the blood, and applied it with his finger to the horns of the altar on all sides, purifying the altar. He poured out the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it by making atonement for it.
03Lv 8:16 Moses took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and he burned them on the altar.
03Lv 8:17 He burned up the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:18 Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
03Lv 8:19 Moses slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 8:20 Moses cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the suet,
03Lv 8:21 but he washed the entrails and shanks with water. He then burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD as He had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:22 Next he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
03Lv 8:23 Moses slaughtered [it], took some of its blood, and put [it] on Aaron's right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
03Lv 8:24 Moses also presented Aaron's sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then Moses sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 8:25 He took the fat-- the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat-- as well as the right thigh.
03Lv 8:26 From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread [made] with oil, and one wafer, and placed [them] on the fat portions and the right thigh.
03Lv 8:27 He put all [these] in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a presentation offering.
03Lv 8:28 Then Moses took them from their hands and burned [them] on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 8:29 He also took the breast and waved it before the LORD as a presentation offering; it was Moses' portion of the ordination ram as the LORD had commanded him.
03Lv 8:30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled [them] on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. In this way he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as his sons and their garments.
03Lv 8:31 Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket for the ordination offering as I commanded: Aaron and his sons are to eat it.
03Lv 8:32 You must burn up what remains of the meat and bread.
03Lv 8:33 You must not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the time your days of ordination are completed, because it will take seven days to ordain you.
03Lv 8:34 The LORD commanded what has been done today in order to make atonement for you.
03Lv 8:35 You must remain at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD's charge so that you will not die, for this is what I was commanded."
03Lv 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses.
03Lv 9:1 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel.
03Lv 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present [them] before the LORD.
03Lv 9:3 And tell the Israelites: 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, male yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;
03Lv 9:4 an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the LORD; and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD is going to appear to you.'"
03Lv 9:5 They brought what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole community came forward and stood before the LORD.
03Lv 9:6 Moses said, "This is what the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
03Lv 9:7 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering; make atonement for yourself and the people. Sacrifice the people's offering and make atonement for them, as the LORD commanded."
03Lv 9:8 So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
03Lv 9:9 Aaron's sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. He poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
03Lv 9:10 He burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 9:11 He burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp.
03Lv 9:12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 9:13 They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, along with the head, and he burned [them] on the altar.
03Lv 9:14 He washed the entrails and the shanks and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
03Lv 9:15 Aaron presented the people's offering. He took the male goat for the people's sin offering, slaughtered it, and made a sin offering with it as he did before.
03Lv 9:16 He presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it according to the regulation.
03Lv 9:17 Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.
03Lv 9:18 Finally, he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people's fellowship sacrifice. Aaron's sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 9:19 They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram-- the fat tail, the [fat] surrounding [the entrails], the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver--
03Lv 9:20 and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,
03Lv 9:21 but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a presentation offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.
03Lv 9:22 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. He came down after sacrificing the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the fellowship offering.
03Lv 9:23 Moses and Aaron then entered the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
03Lv 9:24 Fire came out from the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell facedown [on the ground].
03Lv 10:1 Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his own firepan, put fire in it, placed incense on it, and presented unauthorized fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them [to do].
03Lv 10:2 Then flames leaped from the LORD's presence and burned them to death before the LORD.
03Lv 10:3 So Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD meant when He said: I will show My holiness to those who are near Me, and I will reveal My glory before all the people." But Aaron remained silent.
03Lv 10:4 Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come here and carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to [a place] outside the camp."
03Lv 10:5 So they came forward and carried them in their tunics outside the camp, as Moses had said.
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair hang loose and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will become angry with the whole community. However, your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn over that tragedy when the LORD sent the fire.
03Lv 10:7 You must not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, for the LORD's anointing oil is on you." So they did as Moses said.
03Lv 10:8 The LORD spoke to Aaron:
03Lv 10:9 "You and your sons are not to drink wine or beer when you enter the tent of meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute throughout your generations.
03Lv 10:10 You must distinguish between the holy and the common, and the clean and the unclean,
03Lv 10:11 and teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given to them through Moses."
03Lv 10:12 Moses spoke to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: "Take the grain offering that is left over from the fire offerings to the LORD, and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, because it is especially holy.
03Lv 10:13 You must eat it in a holy place because it is your portion and your sons' from the fire offerings to the LORD, for this is what I was commanded.
03Lv 10:14 But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution in any ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the Israelites' fellowship sacrifices.
03Lv 10:15 They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the presentation offering, together with the offerings of fat portions made by fire, to wave as a presentation offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD commanded."
03Lv 10:16 Later, Moses inquired about the male goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's surviving sons, and asked,
03Lv 10:17 "Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? For it is especially holy, and He has assigned it to you to take away the guilt of the community and make atonement for them before the LORD.
03Lv 10:18 Since its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary [area], as I commanded."
03Lv 10:19 But Aaron replied to Moses, "See, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the LORD's sight?"
03Lv 10:20 When Moses heard this, it was acceptable to him.
03Lv 11:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
03Lv 11:2 "Tell the Israelites: You may eat all these [kinds] of land animals.
03Lv 11:3 You may eat any animal with divided hooves and that chews the cud.
03Lv 11:4 But among the ones that chew the cud or have hooves you are not to eat [these]: the camel, though it chews the cud, does not have hooves-- it is unclean for you;
03Lv 11:5 the hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have hooves-- it is unclean for you;
03Lv 11:6 the hare, though it chews the cud, does not have hooves-- it is unclean for you;
03Lv 11:7 the pig, though it has divided hooves, does not chew the cud-- it is unclean for you.
03Lv 11:8 Do not eat any of their meat or touch their carcasses-- they are unclean for you.
03Lv 11:9 "This [is what] you may eat from all that is in the water: You may eat everything in the water that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or streams.
03Lv 11:10 But these are to be detestable to you: everything that does not have fins and scales in the seas or streams, among all the swarming things and [other] living creatures in the water.
03Lv 11:11 They are to remain detestable to you; you must not eat any of their meat, and you must detest their carcasses.
03Lv 11:12 Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales will be detestable to you.
03Lv 11:13 "You are to detest these birds. They must not be eaten because they are detestable: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
03Lv 11:14 the kite, the various kinds of falcon,
03Lv 11:15 every kind of raven,
03Lv 11:16 the ostrich, the short-eared owl, the gull, the various kinds of hawk,

03Lv 13:3 The priest will examine the infection on the skin of his body. If the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a skin disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean.

03Lv 13:24 "When there is a burn on the skin of one's body produced by fire, and the patch made raw by the burn becomes a reddish-white or white spot,
03Lv 13:25 the priest is to examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a skin disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease.
03Lv 13:26 But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in the spot and it is not beneath the skin but is faded, the priest must quarantine him seven days.
03Lv 13:27 The priest will reexamine him on the seventh day. If it has spread further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a skin disease.

03Lv 13:35 But if the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing,
03Lv 13:36 the priest is to examine the person. If the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; the person is unclean.
03Lv 13:37 But if as far as he can see, the scaly outbreak remains unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has healed; he is clean. The priest is to pronounce the person clean.
03Lv 13:38 "When a man or a woman has white spots on the skin of the body,
03Lv 13:39 the priest is to make an examination. If the spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is [only] a rash that has broken out on the skin; the person is clean.

03Lv 16:6 "Aaron will present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household.
03Lv 16:7 Next he will take the two goats and place them before the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 16:8 After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other for Azazel,
03Lv 16:9 he is to present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
03Lv 16:10 But the goat chosen by lot for Azazel is to be presented alive before the LORD to make purification with it by sending it into the wilderness for Azazel.
03Lv 16:11 "When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he will slaughter the bull for his sin offering.
03Lv 16:12 Then he must take a firepan full of fiery coals from the altar before the LORD and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring [them] inside the veil.
03Lv 16:13 He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, so that the cloud of incense covers the mercy seat that is over the testimony, or else he will die.
03Lv 16:14 He is to take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle [it] with his finger against the east side of the mercy seat; then he will sprinkle some of the blood with his finger before the mercy seat seven times.
03Lv 16:15 "When he slaughters the male goat for the people's sin offering and brings its blood inside the veil, he must do the same with its blood as he did with the bull's blood: he is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it.
03Lv 16:16 He will purify the [most] holy place in this way for all their sins because of the Israelites' impurities and rebellious acts. He will do the same for the tent of meeting that remains among them, because it is surrounded by their impurities.
03Lv 16:17 No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the [most] holy place until he leaves after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel.
03Lv 16:18 Then he will go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put [it] on the horns on all sides of the altar.
03Lv 16:19 He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse and set it apart from the Israelites' impurities.
03Lv 16:20 "When he has finished purifying the [most] holy place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he is to present the live male goat.
03Lv 16:21 Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the Israelites' wrongdoings and rebellious acts-- all their sins. He is to put them on the goat's head and send [it] away into the wilderness by the man appointed for the task.
03Lv 16:22 The goat will carry on it all their wrongdoings into a desolate land, and he will release it there.
03Lv 16:23 "Then Aaron is to enter the tent of meeting, take off the linen garments he wore when he entered the [most] holy place, and leave them there.
03Lv 16:24 He will bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes. Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people's burnt offering; he will make atonement for himself and for the people.
03Lv 16:25 He is to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
03Lv 16:26 The man who released the goat for Azazel is to wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; afterwards he may reenter the camp.
03Lv 16:27 The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the [most] holy place to make atonement, must be brought outside the camp and their hide, flesh, and dung burned up.
03Lv 16:28 The one who burns them is to wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterwards he may reenter the camp.
03Lv 16:29 "This is to be a permanent statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth [day] of the month you are to practice self-denial and do no work, both the native and the foreigner who resides among you.
03Lv 16:30 Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
03Lv 16:31 It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial; it is a permanent statute.
03Lv 16:32 The priest who is anointed and ordained to serve as [high] priest in place of his father will make atonement. He will put on the linen garments, the holy garments,
03Lv 16:33 and purify the most holy place. He will purify the tent of meeting and the altar and will make atonement for the priests and all the people of the assembly.
03Lv 16:34 This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement for the Israelites once a year because of all their sins." And all this was done as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 17:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 17:2 "Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them: This is what the LORD has commanded:
03Lv 17:3 Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, sheep, or goat in the camp, or slaughters [it] outside the camp,
03Lv 17:4 instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present [it] as an offering to the LORD before His tabernacle-- that person will be charged with murder. He has shed blood and must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 17:5 This is so the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they have been offering in the open country. They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting and offer them as fellowship sacrifices to the LORD.
03Lv 17:6 The priest will then sprinkle the blood on the LORD's altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 17:7 They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat-demons that they have prostituted themselves with. This will be a permanent statute for them throughout their generations.
03Lv 17:8 "Say to them: Anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who live among them who offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
03Lv 17:9 but does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 17:10 "Anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who live among them who eats any blood, I will turn against that person who eats blood and cut him off from his people.
03Lv 17:11 For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have appointed it to you to make atonement on the altar for your lives, since it is the lifeblood that makes atonement.
03Lv 17:12 Therefore I say to the Israelites: None of you and no foreigner who lives among you may eat blood.
03Lv 17:13 "Any Israelite or foreigner living among them, who hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten must drain its blood and cover it with dirt.
03Lv 17:14 Since the life of every creature is its blood, I have told the Israelites: You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off.
03Lv 17:15 "Every person, whether the native or the foreigner, who eats an animal that died a natural death or was mauled by wild beasts is to wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will remain unclean until evening; he will be clean.
03Lv 17:16 But if he does not wash [his clothes] and bathe himself, he will bear his punishment."
03Lv 18:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 18:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 18:3 Do not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, or follow the practices of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You must not follow their customs.
03Lv 18:4 You are to practice My ordinances and you are to keep My statutes by following them; I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 18:5 Keep My statutes and ordinances; a person will live if he does them. I am the LORD.
03Lv 18:6 "You are not to come near any close relative for sexual intercourse; I am the LORD.
03Lv 18:7 You are not to shame your father by having sex with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual intercourse with her.

03Lv 18:9 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's, whether born at home or born elsewhere. You are not to have sex with her.
03Lv 18:10 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter, because it will shame your family.
03Lv 18:11 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your father's wife's daughter, who is adopted by your father; she is your sister.
03Lv 18:12 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your father's sister; she is your father's close relative.
03Lv 18:13 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your mother's sister, for she is your mother's close relative.
03Lv 18:14 You are not to shame your father's brother by coming near his wife to have sexual intercourse; she is your aunt.
03Lv 18:15 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; you are not to have sex with her.
03Lv 18:16 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your brother's wife; it will shame your brother.
03Lv 18:17 You are not to have sexual intercourse with a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter and have sex with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.
03Lv 18:18 You are not to marry a woman as a rival to her sister and have sexual intercourse with her during her [sister's] lifetime.
03Lv 18:19 "You are not to come near a woman during her menstrual impurity to have sexual intercourse with her.
03Lv 18:20 You are not to have sexual intercourse with your neighbor's wife, defiling yourself with her.
03Lv 18:21 "You are not to make any of your children pass through [the fire] to Molech. Do not profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.
03Lv 18:22 You are not to sleep with a man as with a woman; it is detestable.
03Lv 18:23 You are not to have sexual intercourse with any animal, defiling yourself with it; a woman is not to present herself to an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.
03Lv 18:24 "Do not defile yourselves by any of these [practices], for the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves by all these things.
03Lv 18:25 The land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.
03Lv 18:26 But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances. You must not commit any of these abominations-- not the native or the foreigner who lives among you.
03Lv 18:27 For the men who were in the land prior to you have committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled.
03Lv 18:28 If you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it has vomited out the nations that were before you.
03Lv 18:29 Any person who does any of these abominations must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 18:30 You must keep My instruction to not do any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them; I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 19:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 19:2 "Speak to the entire Israelite community and tell them: Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.
03Lv 19:3 "Each of you is to respect his mother and father. You are to keep My Sabbaths; I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 19:4 Do not turn to idols or make cast images of gods for yourselves; I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 19:5 "When you offer a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, sacrifice it that you may be accepted.
03Lv 19:6 It is to be eaten on the day you sacrifice [it] or on the next day, but what remains on the third day must be burned up.
03Lv 19:7 If any is eaten on the third day, it is a repulsive thing; it will not be accepted.
03Lv 19:8 Anyone who eats it will bear his punishment, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 19:9 "When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edge of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
03Lv 19:10 You must not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident; I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 19:11 "You must not steal. You must not act deceptively or lie to one another.
03Lv 19:12 You must not swear falsely by My name, profaning the name of your God; I am the LORD.

03Lv 19:16 You must not go about spreading slander among your people; you must not jeopardize your neighbor's life; I am the LORD.
03Lv 19:17 "You must not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor directly, and you will not incur guilt because of him.
03Lv 19:18 Do not take revenge or bear a grudge against members of your community, but love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.
03Lv 19:19 "You are to keep My statutes. You must not crossbreed two different kinds of your livestock, sow your fields with two kinds of seed, or put on a garment made of two kinds of material.
03Lv 19:20 "If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is a slave designated for [another] man, but she has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be punishment. They are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.
03Lv 19:21 However, he must bring his ram as a restitution offering to the LORD at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
03Lv 19:22 The priest will make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the restitution offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven for the sin he committed.
03Lv 19:23 "When you come into the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you are to consider the fruit forbidden. It will be forbidden to you for three years; it is not to be eaten.
03Lv 19:24 In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD.

03Lv 20:3 I will turn against that man and cut him off from his people, because he gave his offspring to Molech, defiling My sanctuary and profaning My holy name.
03Lv 20:4 But if the people of the country look the other way when that man gives any of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death,
03Lv 20:5 then I will turn against that man and his family, and cut off from their people both him and all who follow him, prostituting themselves with Molech.

03Lv 20:19 You must not have sexual intercourse with your mother's sister or your father's sister, for it is exposing one's own blood relative; both people will bear their punishment.
03Lv 20:20 If a man sleeps with his aunt, he has shamed his uncle; they will bear their guilt and die childless.
03Lv 20:21 If a man marries his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has shamed his brother; they will be childless.

03Lv 21:7 They are not to marry a woman defiled by prostitution or divorced by her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
03Lv 21:8 You are to consider him holy since he presents the food of your God. He will be holy to you because I, the LORD who sets you apart, am holy.
03Lv 21:9 If a priest's daughter defiles herself by promiscuity, she defiles her father; she must be burned up.
03Lv 21:10 "The priest who is highest among his brothers, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been ordained to wear the garments, must not dishevel his hair or tear his garments.
03Lv 21:11 He must not go near any dead person or make himself unclean [even] for his father or mother.
03Lv 21:12 He must not leave the sanctuary or he will desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD.
03Lv 21:13 "He is to marry a woman who is a virgin.
03Lv 21:14 He is not to marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by prostitution. He is to marry a virgin from his own people,

03Lv 21:16 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 21:17 "Tell Aaron: None of your descendants throughout your generations who has a physical defect is to come near to present the food of his God.
03Lv 21:18 No man who has any defect is to come near: no man who is blind, lame, facially disfigured, or deformed;
03Lv 21:19 no man who has a broken foot or hand,
03Lv 21:20 or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has an eye defect, a festering rash, scabs, or a crushed testicle.
03Lv 21:21 No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a defect is to come near to present the fire offerings to the LORD. He has a defect and is not to come near to present the food of his God.
03Lv 21:22 He may eat the food of his God from what is especially holy as well as from what is holy.
03Lv 21:23 But because he has a defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar. He is not to desecrate My sanctuaries, for I am the LORD who sets them apart."
03Lv 21:24 Moses said [this] to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
03Lv 22:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 22:2 "Tell Aaron and his sons to deal respectfully with the holy offerings of the Israelites that they have consecrated to Me, so they do not profane My holy name; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:3 Say to them: If any man from any of your descendants throughout your generations is in a state of uncleanness yet approaches the holy offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person will be cut off from My presence; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:4 No man of Aaron's descendants who has a skin disease or a discharge is to eat from the holy offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything made unclean by a dead person or by a man who has an emission of semen,
03Lv 22:5 or whoever touches any swarming creature that makes him unclean or any person who makes him unclean-- whatever his uncleanness--
03Lv 22:6 the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening and is not to eat from the holy offerings unless he has bathed his body with water.
03Lv 22:7 When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the holy offerings, for that is his food.
03Lv 22:8 He must not eat an animal that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts, making himself unclean by it; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:9 They must keep My instruction, or they will be guilty and die because they profane it; I am the LORD who sets them apart.
03Lv 22:10 "No one outside a priest's family is to eat the holy offering. A foreigner staying with a priest or a hired hand is not to eat the holy offering.
03Lv 22:11 But if a priest purchases someone with his money, that person may eat it, and those born in his house may eat his food.
03Lv 22:12 If the priest's daughter is married to a man outside a priest's family, she is not to eat from the holy contributions.
03Lv 22:13 But if the priest's daughter becomes widowed or divorced, has no children, and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may share her father's food. But no outsider may share it.
03Lv 22:14 If anyone eats a holy offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the holy offering to the priest.
03Lv 22:15 The priests must not profane the holy offerings the Israelites give to the LORD
03Lv 22:16 and have them bear the penalty of restitution if the people eat their holy offerings. For I am the LORD who sets them apart."
03Lv 22:17 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 22:18 "Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them: Any man of the house of Israel or of the foreign residents in Israel who presents his offering-- whether they present freewill gifts or payment of vows to the LORD as burnt offerings--
03Lv 22:19 must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for you to be accepted.
03Lv 22:20 You are not to present anything that has a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
03Lv 22:21 "When a man presents a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or flock, it has to be unblemished to be acceptable; there must be no defect in it.
03Lv 22:22 You are not to present any [animal] to the LORD that is blind, injured, maimed, or has a running sore, festering rash, or scabs; you may not put any of them on the altar as a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 22:23 You may sacrifice as a freewill offering any animal from the herd or flock that has an elongated or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable as a vow offering.
03Lv 22:24 You are not to present to the LORD anything that has bruised, crushed, torn, or severed [testicles]; you must not sacrifice [them] in your land.
03Lv 22:25 Neither you nor a foreigner are to present food to your God from any of these animals. They will not be accepted for you because they are deformed and have a defect."
03Lv 22:26 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 22:27 "When an ox, sheep, or goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days; from the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a gift, a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 22:28 But you are not to slaughter an animal from the herd or flock on the same day as its young.
03Lv 22:29 When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
03Lv 22:30 It is to be eaten on the same day. Do not let any of it remain until morning; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:31 "You are to keep My commands and do them; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:32 You must not profane My holy name; I must be treated as holy among the Israelites. I am the LORD who sets you apart,
03Lv 22:33 the One who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD."
03Lv 23:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 23:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: These are My appointed times, the times of the LORD that you will proclaim as sacred assemblies.
03Lv 23:3 "For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there must be a Sabbath of complete rest, a sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; it is a Sabbath to the LORD wherever you live.
03Lv 23:4 "These are the LORD's appointed times, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
03Lv 23:5 The Passover to the LORD comes in the first month, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the month.
03Lv 23:6 The Festival of Unleavened Bread to the LORD is on the fifteenth day of the same month. For seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
03Lv 23:7 On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any daily work.
03Lv 23:8 You are to present a fire offering to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day there will be a sacred assembly; you must not do any daily work."
03Lv 23:9 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 23:10 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you and reap its harvest, you are to bring the first sheaf of your harvest to the priest.
03Lv 23:11 He will wave the sheaf before the LORD so that you may be accepted; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
03Lv 23:12 On the day you wave the sheaf, you are to offer a year-old male lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.
03Lv 23:13 Its grain offering is to be four quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a fire offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, and its drink offering will be one quart of wine.
03Lv 23:14 You must not eat bread, roasted grain, or [any] new grain until this very day, and you have brought the offering of your God. This is to be a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you live.
03Lv 23:15 "You are to count seven complete weeks starting from the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the presentation offering.
03Lv 23:16 You are to count 50 days until the day after the seventh Sabbath and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
03Lv 23:17 Bring two loaves of bread from your settlements as a presentation offering, each of them made from four quarts of fine flour, baked with yeast, as firstfruits to the LORD.
03Lv 23:18 You are to present with the bread seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the Lord, with their grain offerings and drink offerings, a fire offering of a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 23:19 You are also to prepare one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a fellowship sacrifice.
03Lv 23:20 The priest will wave the lambs with the bread of firstfruits as a presentation offering before the LORD; the bread and the two lambs will be holy to the LORD for the priest.
03Lv 23:21 On that same day you are to make a proclamation and hold a sacred assembly. You are not to do any daily work. This is to be a permanent statute wherever you live throughout your generations.
03Lv 23:22 When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap all the way to the edge of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident; I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 23:23 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 23:24 "Tell the Israelites: In the seventh month, on the first [day] of the month, you are to have a day of complete rest, commemoration and jubilation-- a sacred assembly.
03Lv 23:25 You must not do any daily work, but you must present a fire offering to the LORD."
03Lv 23:26 The LORD again spoke to Moses:
03Lv 23:27 "The tenth [day] of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You are to hold a sacred assembly and practice self-denial; you are to present a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 23:28 On this particular day you are not to do any work, for it is a Day of Atonement to make atonement for yourselves before the LORD your God.
03Lv 23:29 If any person does not practice self-denial on this particular day, he must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 23:30 I will destroy among his people anyone who does any work on this same day.
03Lv 23:31 You are not to do any work. This is a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you live.
03Lv 23:32 It will be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial. You are to observe your Sabbath from the evening of the ninth [day] of the month until the [following] evening."
03Lv 23:33 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 23:34 "Tell the Israelites: The Festival of Booths to the LORD begins on the fifteenth day of this seventh month and continues for seven days.
03Lv 23:35 There is to be a sacred assembly on the first day; you are not to do any daily work.
03Lv 23:36 You are to present a fire offering to the LORD for seven days. On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly and present a fire offering to the LORD. It is a solemn gathering; you are not to do any daily work.
03Lv 23:37 "These are the LORD's appointed times that you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting fire offerings to the LORD, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its [designated] day.
03Lv 23:38 These are in addition to the offerings for the LORD's Sabbaths, your gifts, all your vow offerings, and all your freewill offerings that you give to the LORD.
03Lv 23:39 "You are to celebrate the LORD's festival on the fifteenth day of the seventh month for seven days after you have gathered the produce of the land. There will be complete rest on the first day and complete rest on the eighth day.
03Lv 23:40 On the first day you are to take the product of majestic trees-- palm fronds, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook-- and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
03Lv 23:41 You are to celebrate it as a festival to the LORD seven days each year. This is a permanent statute for you throughout your generations; you must celebrate it in the seventh month.
03Lv 23:42 You are to live in booths for seven days. All the native-born of Israel must live in booths,
03Lv 23:43 so that your generations may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 23:44 So Moses declared the LORD's appointed times to the Israelites.
03Lv 24:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 24:2 "Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, so that the lamp will burn regularly.
03Lv 24:3 Aaron is to tend it regularly from evening until morning before the LORD outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting. This is a permanent statute throughout your generations.
03Lv 24:4 He must regularly tend the lamps on the pure [gold] lampstand in the LORD's presence.
03Lv 24:5 "Take fine flour and bake it into 12 loaves; each loaf is to be made with four quarts.
03Lv 24:6 Arrange them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure [gold] table before the LORD.
03Lv 24:7 Place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread and a fire offering to the LORD.
03Lv 24:8 The bread is to be set out before the LORD every Sabbath day as a perpetual covenant obligation on the part of the Israelites.
03Lv 24:9 It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, for it is the holiest portion for him from the fire offerings to the Lord; this is a permanent rule."
03Lv 24:10 Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father was among the Israelites. A fight broke out in the camp between the Israelite woman's son and an Israelite man.
03Lv 24:11 Her son cursed and blasphemed the Name, and they brought him to Moses. (His mother's name was Shelomith, a daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.)
03Lv 24:12 They put him in custody until the LORD's decision could be made clear to them.
03Lv 24:13 Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 24:14 "Bring the one who has cursed to the outside of the camp and have all who heard [him] lay their hands on his head; then have the whole community stone him.
03Lv 24:15 And tell the Israelites: If anyone curses his God, he will bear the consequences of his sin.
03Lv 24:16 Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD is to be put to death; the whole community must stone him. If he blasphemes the Name, he is to be put to death, whether the foreign resident or the native.
03Lv 24:17 "If a man kills anyone, he must be put to death.
03Lv 24:18 Whoever kills an animal is to make restitution for it, life for life.
03Lv 24:19 If any man inflicts a permanent injury on his neighbor, whatever he has done is to be done to him:
03Lv 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Whatever injury he inflicted on the person, the same is to be inflicted on him.
03Lv 24:21 Whoever kills an animal is to make restitution for it, but whoever kills a person is to be put to death.
03Lv 24:22 You are to have the same law for the foreign resident and the native, because I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 24:23 After Moses spoke to the Israelites, they brought the one who had cursed to the outside of the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 25:1 The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai:
03Lv 25:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you, the land will observe a Sabbath to the LORD.
03Lv 25:3 You may sow your field for six years, and you may prune your vineyard and gather its produce for six years.
03Lv 25:4 But there will be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land in the seventh year, a Sabbath to the LORD: you are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard.
03Lv 25:5 You are not to reap what grows by itself from your crop, or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. It must be a year of complete rest for the land.
03Lv 25:6 [Whatever] the land [produces during] the Sabbath year can be food for you; for yourself, your male or female slave, and the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you.
03Lv 25:7 All of its growth may serve as food for your livestock and the wild animals in your land.
03Lv 25:8 "You are to count seven sabbatic years, seven times seven years, so that the time period of the seven sabbatic years amounts to 49.
03Lv 25:9 Then you are to sound a trumpet loudly in the seventh month, on the tenth [day] of the month; you will sound it throughout your land on the Day of Atonement.
03Lv 25:10 You are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all its inhabitants. It will be your Jubilee, when each of you are to return to his property and each of you to his clan.
03Lv 25:11 The fiftieth year will be your Jubilee; you are not to sow, reap what grows by itself, or harvest its untended vines.
03Lv 25:12 It is to be holy to you because it is the Jubilee; you may [only] eat its produce [directly] from the field.
03Lv 25:13 "In this Year of Jubilee, each of you will return to his property.
03Lv 25:14 If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, do not cheat one another.
03Lv 25:15 You are to make the purchase from your neighbor based on the number of years since the last Jubilee. He is to sell to you based on the number of [remaining] harvest years.
03Lv 25:16 You are to increase its price in proportion to a greater amount of years, and decrease its price in proportion to a lesser amount of years, because what he is selling to you is a number of harvests.
03Lv 25:17 You are not to cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 25:18 "You are to observe My statutes and ordinances and carefully observe them, so that you may live securely in the land.
03Lv 25:19 Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat, be satisfied, and live securely in the land.
03Lv 25:20 If you wonder: 'What will we eat in the seventh year if we don't sow or gather our produce?'
03Lv 25:21 I will appoint My blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years.
03Lv 25:22 When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest. You will be eating this until the ninth year when its harvest comes in.
03Lv 25:23 "The land is not to be permanently sold because it is Mine, and you are only foreigners and temporary residents on My land.
03Lv 25:24 You are to allow the redemption of any land you occupy.
03Lv 25:25 If your brother becomes destitute and sells part of his property, his nearest relative may come and redeem what his brother has sold.
03Lv 25:26 If a man has no family redeemer, but he prospers and obtains enough to redeem his land,
03Lv 25:27 he may calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man he sold it to, and return to his property.
03Lv 25:28 But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of its purchaser until the Year of Jubilee. It is to be released at the Jubilee, so that he may return to his property.
03Lv 25:29 "If a man sells a residence in a walled city, his right of redemption will last until a year has passed after its sale; his right of redemption will last a year.
03Lv 25:30 If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its purchaser throughout his generations. It is not to be released on the Jubilee.
03Lv 25:31 But houses in villages that have no walls around them are to be classified as open fields. The right to redeem [such] houses stays in effect, and they are to be released at the Jubilee.
03Lv 25:32 "Concerning the Levitical cities, the Levites always have the right to redeem houses in the cities they possess.
03Lv 25:33 Whatever [property] one of the Levites can redeem-- a house sold in a city they possess-- must be released at the Jubilee, because the houses in the Levitical cities are their possession among the Israelites.
03Lv 25:34 The open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for it is their permanent possession.
03Lv 25:35 "If your brother becomes destitute and cannot sustain himself among you, you are to support him as a foreigner or temporary resident, so that he can continue to live among you.
03Lv 25:36 Do not profit or take interest from him, but fear your God and let your brother live among you.
03Lv 25:37 You are not to lend him your silver with interest or sell [him] your food for profit.
03Lv 25:38 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
03Lv 25:39 "If your brother among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you, you must not force him to do slave labor.
03Lv 25:40 Let him stay with you as a hired hand or temporary resident; he may work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:41 Then he and his children are to be released from you, and he may return to his clan and his ancestral property.
03Lv 25:42 They are not to be sold as slaves, because they are My slaves I brought out of the land of Egypt.
03Lv 25:43 You are not to rule over them harshly but fear your God.
03Lv 25:44 Your male and female slaves are to be from the nations around you; you may purchase male and female slaves.
03Lv 25:45 You may also purchase them from the foreigners staying with you, or from their families living among you-- those born in your land. These may become your property.
03Lv 25:46 You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But concerning your brothers, the Israelites, you must not rule over one another harshly.
03Lv 25:47 "If a foreigner or temporary resident [living] among you prospers, but your brother [living] near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner living among you, or to a member of the foreigner's clan,
03Lv 25:48 he has the right of redemption after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him.
03Lv 25:49 His uncle or cousin may redeem him, or any of his close relatives from his clan may redeem him. If he prospers, he may redeem himself.
03Lv 25:50 The one who purchased him is to calculate [the time] from the year he sold himself to him until the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be [determined] by the number of years. It will be [set] for him like the daily wages of a hired hand.
03Lv 25:51 If many years are still left, he must pay his redemption price in proportion to them based on his purchase price.
03Lv 25:52 If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he will calculate and pay the price of his redemption in proportion to his [remaining] years.
03Lv 25:53 He will stay with him like a man hired year by year. A foreign owner is not to rule over him harshly in your sight.
03Lv 25:54 If he is not redeemed in any of these [ways], he and his children are to be released at the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:55 For the Israelites are My slaves. They are My slaves I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 26:1 "Do not make idols for yourselves, set up a carved image or sacred pillar for yourselves, or place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it, for I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 26:2 You must keep My Sabbaths and honor My sanctuary; I am the LORD.
03Lv 26:3 "If you follow My statutes and faithfully observe My commands,
03Lv 26:4 I will give you rain at the right time, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
03Lv 26:5 Your threshing will continue until grape harvest, and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time; you will have plenty of food to eat and live securely in your land.
03Lv 26:6 I will give peace to the land, and you will lie down with nothing to frighten [you]. I will remove dangerous animals from the land, and no sword will pass through your land.
03Lv 26:7 You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword.
03Lv 26:8 Five of you will pursue 100, and 100 of you will pursue 10,000; your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
03Lv 26:9 "I will turn to you, make you fruitful and multiply you, and confirm My covenant with you.
03Lv 26:10 You will eat the old grain of the previous year and will clear out the old to make room for the new.
03Lv 26:11 I will place My residence among you, and I will not reject you.
03Lv 26:12 I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people.
03Lv 26:13 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, so that you would no longer be their slaves. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to live in freedom.
03Lv 26:14 "But if you do not obey Me and observe all these commands--
03Lv 26:15 if you reject My statutes and despise My ordinances, and do not observe all My commands-- and break My covenant,
03Lv 26:16 then I will do this to you: I will bring terror on you-- wasting disease and fever that will cause your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away. You will sow your seed in vain because your enemies will eat it.
03Lv 26:17 I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even though no one is pursuing you.
03Lv 26:18 "But if after these things you will not obey Me, I will proceed to discipline you seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:19 I will break down your strong pride. I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,
03Lv 26:20 and your strength will be used up for nothing. Your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit.
03Lv 26:21 "If you act with hostility toward Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:22 I will send wild animals against you that will deprive you of your children, ravage your livestock, and reduce your numbers until your roads are deserted.
03Lv 26:23 "If in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline, but act with hostility toward Me,
03Lv 26:24 then I will act with hostility toward you; I also will strike you seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:25 I will bring a sword against you to execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your cities, I will send a pestilence among you, and you will be delivered into enemy hands.
03Lv 26:26 When I cut off your supply of bread, 10 women will bake your bread in a single oven and ration out your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied.
03Lv 26:27 "And if in spite of this you do not obey Me but act with hostility toward Me,
03Lv 26:28 I will act with furious hostility toward you; I will also discipline you seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:29 You will eat the flesh of your sons; you will eat the flesh of your daughters.
03Lv 26:30 I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and heap your dead bodies on the lifeless bodies of your idols; I will reject you.
03Lv 26:31 I will reduce your cities to ruins and devastate your sanctuaries. I will not smell the pleasing aroma of your [sacrifices].
03Lv 26:32 I also will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to live there will be appalled by it.
03Lv 26:33 But I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw a sword [to chase] after you. So your land will become desolate, and your cities will become ruins.
03Lv 26:34 "Then the land will make up for its Sabbath [years] during the time it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest and make up for its Sabbaths.
03Lv 26:35 As long as it lies desolate, it will have the rest it did not have during your Sabbaths when you lived there.
03Lv 26:36 "I will put anxiety in the hearts of those of you who survive in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a wind-driven leaf will put them to flight, and they will flee as one flees from a sword, and fall though no one is pursuing [them].
03Lv 26:37 They will stumble over one another as if [fleeing] from a sword though no one is pursuing [them]. You will not be able to stand against your enemies.
03Lv 26:38 You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you.
03Lv 26:39 Those who survive in the lands of your enemies will waste away because of their sin; they will also waste away because of their fathers' sins along with theirs.
03Lv 26:40 "But if they will confess their sin and the sin of their fathers-- their unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me, and how they acted with hostility toward Me,
03Lv 26:41 and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies-- and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled, and if they will pay the penalty for their sin,
03Lv 26:42 then I will remember My covenant with Jacob. I will also remember My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
03Lv 26:43 For the land abandoned by them will make up for its Sabbaths by lying desolate without the people, while they pay the penalty for their sin, because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes.
03Lv 26:44 Yet in spite of this, while they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or abhor them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them, since I am the LORD their God.
03Lv 26:45 For their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God; I am the LORD."
03Lv 26:46 These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
03Lv 27:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
03Lv 27:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When someone makes a special vow to the LORD that involves the valuation of people,
03Lv 27:3 if the valuation concerns a male from 20 to 60 years old, your valuation is 50 silver shekels [measured] by the standard sanctuary shekel.
03Lv 27:4 If the person is a female, your valuation is 30 shekels.
03Lv 27:5 If the person is from five to 20 years old, your valuation for a male is 20 shekels and for a female 10 shekels.
03Lv 27:6 If the person is from one month to five years old, your valuation for a male is five silver shekels, and for a female your valuation is three shekels of silver.
03Lv 27:7 If the person is 60 years or more, your valuation is 15 shekels for a male and 10 shekels for a female.
03Lv 27:8 But if one is too poor to pay the valuation, he must present the person before the priest and the priest will set a value for him. The priest will set a value for him according to what the one making the vow can afford.
03Lv 27:9 "If the vow involves one of the animals that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any of these he gives to the LORD will be holy.
03Lv 27:10 He may not replace it or make a substitution for it, either good for bad, or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy.
03Lv 27:11 "If the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest.
03Lv 27:12 The priest will set its value, whether high or low; the price will be set as the priest makes the valuation for you.
03Lv 27:13 If the one who brought it decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the valuation.
03Lv 27:14 "When a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, the priest will assess its value, whether high or low. The price will stand just as the priest assesses it.
03Lv 27:15 But if the one who consecrated his house redeems [it], he must add a fifth to the valuation price, and it will be his.
03Lv 27:16 "If a man consecrates to the LORD any part of a field that he possesses, your valuation will be proportional to the seed needed to sow it, at the rate of 50 silver shekels for [every] five bushels of barley seed.
03Lv 27:17 If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation.
03Lv 27:18 But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the price for him in proportion to the years left until the [next] Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced.
03Lv 27:19 If the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the valuation price, and the field will transfer back to him.
03Lv 27:20 But if he does not redeem the field or if he has sold it to another man, it is no longer redeemable.
03Lv 27:21 When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will be holy to the LORD like a field permanently set apart; it becomes the priest's property.
03Lv 27:22 "If a person consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased that is not part of his inherited landholding,
03Lv 27:23 then the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up to the Year of Jubilee, and the person will pay the valuation on that day as a holy offering to the LORD.
03Lv 27:24 In the Year of Jubilee the field will return to the one he bought it from, the original owner.
03Lv 27:25 All your valuations will be [measured] by the standard sanctuary shekel, 20 gerahs to the shekel.
03Lv 27:26 "But no one can consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, whether an animal from the herd or flock, to the LORD, because a firstborn [already] belongs to the LORD.
03Lv 27:27 If it is one of the unclean livestock, it must be ransomed according to your valuation by adding a fifth of its value to it. If it is not redeemed, it can be sold according to your valuation.
03Lv 27:28 "Nothing that a man permanently sets apart to the LORD from all he owns, whether a person, an animal, or his inherited landholding, can be sold or redeemed; everything set apart is especially holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:29 No person who has been set apart [for destruction] is to be ransomed; he must be put to death.
03Lv 27:30 "Every tenth of the land's produce, grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:31 If a man decides to redeem any part of this tenth, he must add one-fifth to its value.
03Lv 27:32 Every tenth animal from the herd or flock, which passes under the [shepherd's] rod, will be holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:33 He is not to inspect whether it is good or bad, and he is not to make a substitution for it. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute will be holy; they cannot be redeemed."
03Lv 27:34 These are the commands the LORD gave Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.

04Nm 1:1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai, on the first [day] of the second month of the second year after Israel's departure from the land of Egypt:
04Nm 1:2 "Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of every male one by one.
04Nm 1:3 You and Aaron are to register those who are 20 years old or more by their military divisions-- everyone who can serve in Israel's army.
04Nm 1:4 A man from each tribe is to be with you, each one the head of his ancestral house.
04Nm 1:5 These are the names of the men who are to assist you: Elizur son of Shedeur from Reuben;
04Nm 1:6 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai from Simeon;
04Nm 1:7 Nahshon son of Amminadab from Judah;
04Nm 1:8 Nethanel son of Zuar from Issachar;
04Nm 1:9 Eliab son of Helon from Zebulun;
04Nm 1:10 from the sons of Joseph: Elishama son of Ammihud from Ephraim, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur from Manasseh;
04Nm 1:11 Abidan son of Gideoni from Benjamin;
04Nm 1:12 Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai from Dan;
04Nm 1:13 Pagiel son of Ochran from Asher;
04Nm 1:14 Eliasaph son of Deuel from Gad;
04Nm 1:15 Ahira son of Enan from Naphtali.
04Nm 1:16 These are the men called from the community; they are leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of Israel's clans."
04Nm 1:17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
04Nm 1:18 and they assembled the whole community on the first day of the second month. They recorded their ancestry by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting one by one the names of those 20 years old or more,
04Nm 1:19 just as the LORD commanded Moses. He registered them in the Wilderness of Sinai:
04Nm 1:20 The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting one by one the names of every male 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:21 those registered for the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500.
04Nm 1:22 The descendants of Simeon: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, those registered counting one by one the names of every male 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:23 those registered for the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300.
04Nm 1:24 The descendants of Gad: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:25 those registered for the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650.
04Nm 1:26 The descendants of Judah: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:27 those registered for the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600.
04Nm 1:28 The descendants of Issachar: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:29 those registered for the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400.
04Nm 1:30 The descendants of Zebulun: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:31 those registered for the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400.
04Nm 1:32 The descendants of Joseph: The descendants of Ephraim: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:33 those registered for the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500.
04Nm 1:34 The descendants of Manasseh: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:35 those registered for the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200.
04Nm 1:36 The descendants of Benjamin: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:37 those registered for the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400.
04Nm 1:38 The descendants of Dan: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:39 those registered for the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700.
04Nm 1:40 The descendants of Asher: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:41 those registered for the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500.
04Nm 1:42 The descendants of Naphtali: according to their family records by their clans and their ancestral houses, counting the names of those 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in the army,
04Nm 1:43 those registered for the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400.
04Nm 1:44 These are the men Moses and Aaron registered, with [the assistance of] the 12 leaders of Israel; each represented his ancestral house.
04Nm 1:45 So all the Israelites 20 years old or more, everyone who could serve in Israel's army, were registered by their ancestral houses.
04Nm 1:46 All those registered numbered 603,550.
04Nm 1:47 But the Levites were not registered with them by their ancestral tribe.
04Nm 1:48 For the LORD had told Moses:
04Nm 1:49 "Do not register or take a census of the tribe of Levi with the [other] Israelites.
04Nm 1:50 Appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it. They are to transport the tabernacle and all its articles, take care of it, and camp around it.
04Nm 1:51 Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to stop at a campsite, the Levites are to set it up. Any unauthorized person who comes near [it] must be put to death.
04Nm 1:52 "The Israelites are to camp by their military divisions, each man with his encampment and under his banner.
04Nm 1:53 The Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the testimony and watch over it, so that no wrath will fall on the Israelite community."
04Nm 1:54 The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
04Nm 2:2 "The Israelites are to camp under their respective banners beside the flags of their ancestral houses. They are to camp around the tent of meeting at a distance [from it]:
04Nm 2:3 Judah's military divisions will camp on the east side toward the sunrise under their banner. The leader of the descendants of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04Nm 2:4 His military division numbers 74,600.
04Nm 2:5 The tribe of Issachar will camp next to it. The leader of the Issacharites is Nethanel son of Zuar.
04Nm 2:6 His military division numbers 54,400.
04Nm 2:7 The tribe of Zebulun [will be next]. The leader of the Zebulunites is Eliab son of Helon.
04Nm 2:8 His military division numbers 57,400.
04Nm 2:9 The total number in their military divisions who belong to Judah's encampment is 186,400; they will move out first.
04Nm 2:10 Reuben's military divisions will camp on the south side under their banner. The leader of the Reubenites is Elizur son of Shedeur.
04Nm 2:11 His military division numbers 46,500.
04Nm 2:12 The tribe of Simeon will camp next to it. The leader of the Simeonites is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
04Nm 2:13 His military division numbers 59,300.
04Nm 2:14 The tribe of Gad [will be next]. The leader of the Gadites is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04Nm 2:15 His military division numbers 45,650.
04Nm 2:16 The total number in their military divisions who belong to Reuben's encampment is 151,450; they will move out second.
04Nm 2:17 The tent of meeting is to move out with the Levites' camp, which is in the middle of the camps. They are to move out just as they camp, each in his place, with their banners.
04Nm 2:18 Ephraim's military divisions will camp on the west side under their banner. The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud.
04Nm 2:19 His military division numbers 40,500.
04Nm 2:20 The tribe of Manasseh will be next to it. The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
04Nm 2:21 His military division numbers 32,200.
04Nm 2:22 The tribe of Benjamin [will be next]. The leader of the Benjaminites is Abidan son of Gideoni.
04Nm 2:23 His military division numbers 35,400.
04Nm 2:24 The total in their military divisions who belong to Ephraim's encampment number 108,100; they will move out third.
04Nm 2:25 Dan's military divisions will camp on the north side under their banner. The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04Nm 2:26 His military division numbers 62,700.
04Nm 2:27 The tribe of Asher will camp next to it. The leader of the Asherites is Pagiel son of Ochran.
04Nm 2:28 His military division numbers 41,500.
04Nm 2:29 The tribe of Naphtali [will be next]. The leader of the Naphtalites is Ahira son of Enan.
04Nm 2:30 His military division numbers 53,400.
04Nm 2:31 The total number who belong to Dan's encampment is 157,600; they are to move out last, with their banners."
04Nm 2:32 These are the Israelites registered by their ancestral houses. The total number in the camps by their military divisions is 603,550.
04Nm 2:33 But the Levites were not registered among the Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:34 The Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; they camped by their banners in this way and moved out the same way, each man by his clan and by his ancestral house.
04Nm 3:1 These are the family records of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
04Nm 3:2 These are the names of Aaron's sons: Nadab, the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
04Nm 3:3 These are the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
04Nm 3:4 But Nadab and Abihu died in the LORD's presence when they presented unauthorized fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai, and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under the direction of Aaron their father.
04Nm 3:5 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 3:6 "Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
04Nm 3:7 They are to perform duties for him and the entire community before the tent of meeting by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:8 They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting and perform duties for the Israelites by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:9 Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they have been assigned exclusively to him from the Israelites.
04Nm 3:10 You are to appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out their priestly responsibilities, but any unauthorized person who comes near [the sanctuary] must be put to death."
04Nm 3:11 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 3:12 "See, I have taken the Levites from the Israelites in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites belong to Me,
04Nm 3:13 because every firstborn belongs to Me. At the time I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated every firstborn in Israel to Myself, both man and animal; they are Mine; I am the LORD."
04Nm 3:14 The LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
04Nm 3:15 "Register the Levites by their ancestral houses and their clans. You are to register every male one month old or more."
04Nm 3:16 So Moses registered them in obedience to the LORD as he had been commanded:
04Nm 3:17 These were Levi's sons by name: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
04Nm 3:18 These were the names of Gershon's sons by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
04Nm 3:19 Kohath's sons by their clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
04Nm 3:20 Merari's sons by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans by their ancestral houses.
04Nm 3:21 The Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan came from Gershon; these were the Gershonite clans.
04Nm 3:22 Those registered, counting every male one month old or more, numbered 7,500.
04Nm 3:23 The Gershonite clans camped behind the tabernacle on the west side,
04Nm 3:24 and the leader of the Gershonite family was Eliasaph son of Lael.
04Nm 3:25 The Gershonites' duties at the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle, the tent, its covering, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,
04Nm 3:26 the hangings of the courtyard, the screen for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, and the tent ropes-- all the work relating to these.
04Nm 3:27 The Amramite clan, the Izharite clan, the Hebronite clan, and the Uzzielite clan came from Kohath; these were the Kohathites.
04Nm 3:28 Counting every male one month old or more, there were 8,600 responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:29 The clans of the Kohathites camped on the south side of the tabernacle,
04Nm 3:30 and the leader of the family of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
04Nm 3:31 Their duties involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the sanctuary utensils that were used with these, and the screen-- and all the work relating to them.
04Nm 3:32 The chief of the Levite leaders was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he had oversight of those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:33 The Mahlite clan and the Mushite clan came from Merari; these were the Merarite clans.
04Nm 3:34 Those registered, counting every male one month old or more, numbered 6,200.
04Nm 3:35 The leader of the family of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they camped on the north side of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:36 The assigned duties of Merari's descendants involved the tabernacle's supports, crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and all the work related to these,
04Nm 3:37 in addition to the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes.
04Nm 3:38 Moses, Aaron, and his sons, who performed the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites, camped in front of the tabernacle on the east, in front of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise. Any unauthorized person who came near [it] was to be put to death.
04Nm 3:39 The total number of all the Levite males one month old or more that Moses and Aaron registered by their clans at the LORD's command was 22,000.
04Nm 3:40 The LORD told Moses: "Register every firstborn male of the Israelites one month old or more, and list their names.
04Nm 3:41 You are to take the Levites for Me-- I am the Lord-- in place of every firstborn among the Israelites, and the Levites' cattle in place of every firstborn among the Israelites' cattle."
04Nm 3:42 So Moses registered every firstborn among the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 3:43 The total number of the firstborn males one month old or more listed by name was 22,273.
04Nm 3:44 The LORD spoke to Moses again:
04Nm 3:45 "Take the Levites in place of every firstborn among the Israelites, and the Levites' cattle in place of their cattle. The Levites belong to Me; I am the LORD.
04Nm 3:46 As the redemption price for the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites,
04Nm 3:47 collect five shekels for each person, according to the standard sanctuary shekel-- 20 gerahs to the shekel.
04Nm 3:48 Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for those who are in excess among the Israelites."
04Nm 3:49 So Moses collected the redemption money from those in excess of the ones redeemed by the Levites.
04Nm 3:50 He collected the money from the firstborn Israelites: 1,365 [shekels measured] by the standard sanctuary shekel.
04Nm 3:51 He gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the LORD, just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 4:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
04Nm 4:2 "Among the Levites, take a census of the Kohathites by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04Nm 4:3 men from 30 years old to 50 years old-- everyone who is qualified to do work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:4 "The service of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting concerns the most holy objects.
04Nm 4:5 Whenever the camp is about to move on, Aaron and his sons are to go in, take down the screening veil, and cover the ark of the testimony with it.
04Nm 4:6 They are to place over this a covering made of manatee skin, spread a solid blue cloth on top, and insert its poles.
04Nm 4:7 "They are to spread a blue cloth over the table of the Presence and place the plates and cups on it, as well as the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering. The regular bread [offering] is to be on it.
04Nm 4:8 They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover them with a covering made of manatee skin, and insert the poles [in the table].
04Nm 4:9 "They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand used for light, with its lamps, snuffers, and firepans, as well as its jars of oil by which they service it.
04Nm 4:10 Then they must place it with all its utensils inside a covering made of manatee skin and put [them] on the carrying frame.
04Nm 4:11 "They are to spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, cover it with a covering made of manatee skin, and insert its poles.
04Nm 4:12 They are to take all the serving utensils they use in the sanctuary, place [them] in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering made of manatee skin, and put [them] on a carrying frame.
04Nm 4:13 "They are to remove the ashes from the [bronze] altar, spread a purple cloth over it,
04Nm 4:14 and place all the equipment on it that they use in serving: the firepans, meatforks, shovels, and basins-- all the equipment of the altar. They are to spread a covering made of manatee skin over it and insert its poles.
04Nm 4:15 "Aaron and his sons are to finish covering the holy objects and all their equipment whenever the camp is to move on. The Kohathites will come and carry them, but they are not to touch the holy objects or they will die. These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:16 "Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has oversight of the lamp oil, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. [He has] oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, the holy objects and their utensils."
04Nm 4:17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
04Nm 4:18 "Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be wiped out from the Levites.
04Nm 4:19 Do this for them so that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons are to go in and assign each man his task and transportation duty.
04Nm 4:20 The Kohathites are not to go in and look at the holy objects, even for a moment, or they will die."
04Nm 4:21 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 4:22 "Take a census of the Gershonites also, by their ancestral houses and their clans.
04Nm 4:23 Register men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who is qualified to perform service, to do work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:24 This is the service of the Gershonite clans regarding work and transportation duties:
04Nm 4:25 They are to transport the tabernacle curtains, the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering made of manatee skin on top of it, the screen for the entrance to the tent of meeting,
04Nm 4:26 the hangings of the courtyard, the screen for the entrance at the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, along with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. They will carry out everything that needs to be done with these items.
04Nm 4:27 "All the service of the Gershonites, all their transportation duties and all their [other] work, is to be [done] at the command of Aaron and his sons; you are to assign to them all that they are responsible to carry.
04Nm 4:28 This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting, and their duties will be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 4:29 "As for the Merarites, you are to register them by their clans and their ancestral houses.
04Nm 4:30 Register men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who is qualified to do the work of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:31 This is what they are responsible to carry as the whole of their service at the tent of meeting: the supports of the tabernacle, with its crossbars, posts, and bases,
04Nm 4:32 the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their equipment and all the work related to them. You are to assign by name the items that they are responsible to carry.
04Nm 4:33 This is the service of the Merarite clans regarding all their work at the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest."
04Nm 4:34 So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community registered the Kohathites by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04Nm 4:35 men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:36 The men registered by their clans numbered 2,750.
04Nm 4:37 These were the registered men of the Kohathite clans, everyone who could serve at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron registered them at the LORD's command through Moses.
04Nm 4:38 The Gershonites were registered by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04Nm 4:39 men from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:40 The men registered by their clans and their ancestral houses numbered 2,630.
04Nm 4:41 These were the registered men of the Gershonite clans. At the LORD's command Moses and Aaron registered everyone who could serve at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:42 The men of the Merarite clans were registered by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04Nm 4:43 those from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified for work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:44 The men registered by their clans numbered 3,200.
04Nm 4:45 These were the registered men of the Merarite clans; Moses and Aaron registered them at the LORD's command through Moses.
04Nm 4:46 Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel registered all the Levites by their clans and their ancestral houses,
04Nm 4:47 from 30 years old to 50 years old, everyone who was qualified to do the work of serving at the tent of meeting and transporting [it].
04Nm 4:48 Their registered men numbered 8,580.
04Nm 4:49 At the LORD's command they were registered under the direction of Moses, each one according to his work and transportation duty, and his assignment was as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 5:1 The LORD instructed Moses:
04Nm 5:2 "Command the Israelites to send away anyone from the camp who is afflicted with a skin disease, anyone who has a [bodily] discharge, or anyone who is defiled because of a corpse.
04Nm 5:3 You must send away both male or female; send them outside the camp, so that they will not defile their camps where I dwell among them."
04Nm 5:4 The Israelites did this, sending them outside the camp. The Israelites did as the LORD instructed Moses.
04Nm 5:5 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 5:6 "Tell the Israelites: When a man or woman commits any sin against another, that person acts unfaithfully toward the LORD and is guilty.
04Nm 5:7 The person is to confess the sin he has committed. He is to pay full compensation, add a fifth of its value to it, and give [it] to the individual he has wronged.
04Nm 5:8 But if that individual has no relative to receive compensation, the compensation goes to the LORD for the priest, along with the atonement ram by which the priest will make atonement for the [guilty] person.
04Nm 5:9 Every holy contribution the Israelites present to the priest will be his.
04Nm 5:10 Each one's holy contribution is his [to give]; what each one gives to the priest will be his."
04Nm 5:11 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 5:12 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: If any man's wife goes astray, is unfaithful to him,
04Nm 5:13 and sleeps with another, but it is concealed from her husband, and she is undetected, even though she has defiled herself, since there is no witness against her, and she wasn't caught [in the act];
04Nm 5:14 and if a feeling of jealousy comes over the husband and he becomes jealous because of his wife who has defiled herself-- or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him and he becomes jealous of her though she has not defiled herself--
04Nm 5:15 then the man is to bring his wife to the priest. He is also to bring an offering for her of two quarts of barley flour. He is not to pour oil over it or put frankincense on it because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering for remembrance that brings sin to mind.
04Nm 5:16 "The priest is to bring her forward and have her stand before the LORD.
04Nm 5:17 Then the priest is to take holy water in a clay bowl, and take some of the dust from the tabernacle floor and put [it] in the water.
04Nm 5:18 After the priest has the woman stand before the Lord, he is to let down her hair and place in her hands the grain offering for remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. The priest is to hold the bitter water that brings a curse.
04Nm 5:19 The priest will require the woman to take an oath and will say to her, 'If no man has slept with you, if you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband's authority, be unaffected by this bitter water that brings a curse.
04Nm 5:20 But if you have gone astray while under your husband's authority, if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has slept with you'--
04Nm 5:21 at this point the priest must make the woman take the oath with the sworn curse, and he is to say to her-- 'May the LORD make you into an object of your people's cursing and swearing when He makes your thigh shrivel and your belly swell.
04Nm 5:22 May this water that brings a curse enter your stomach, causing [your] belly to swell and [your] thigh to shrivel.' "And the woman must reply, ' Amen, Amen.'
04Nm 5:23 "Then the priest is to write these curses on a scroll and wash [them] off into the bitter water.
04Nm 5:24 He will require the woman to drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and it will enter her and cause bitter suffering.
04Nm 5:25 The priest is to take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, wave the offering before the LORD, and bring it to the altar.
04Nm 5:26 The priest is to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar. Then he will require the woman to drink the water.
04Nm 5:27 "When he makes her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her belly will swell, and her thigh will shrivel. She will become a curse among her people.
04Nm 5:28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is pure, she will be unaffected and will be able to conceive children.
04Nm 5:29 "This is the law regarding jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband's authority,
04Nm 5:30 or when a feeling of jealousy comes over a husband and he becomes jealous of his wife. He is to have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest will apply this entire ritual to her.
04Nm 5:31 The husband will be free of guilt, but that woman will bear the consequences of her guilt."
04Nm 6:1 The LORD instructed Moses:
04Nm 6:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When a man or woman makes a special vow, a Nazirite vow, to consecrate himself to the Lord,
04Nm 6:3 he is to abstain from wine and beer. He must not drink vinegar made from wine or from beer. He must not drink any grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins.
04Nm 6:4 He is not to eat anything produced by the grapevine, from seeds to skin, during his vow.
04Nm 6:5 "You must not cut his hair throughout the time of his vow of consecration. He must be holy until the time is completed during which he consecrates himself to the LORD; he is to let the hair of his head grow long.
04Nm 6:6 He must not go near a dead body during the time he consecrates himself to the LORD.
04Nm 6:7 He is not to defile himself for his father or mother, or his brother or sister, when they die, because the hair consecrated to his God is on his head.
04Nm 6:8 He is holy to the LORD during the time of consecration.
04Nm 6:9 "If someone suddenly dies near him, defiling his consecrated head of hair, he must shave his head on the day of his purification; he is to shave it on the seventh day.
04Nm 6:10 On the eighth day he is to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04Nm 6:11 The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement on behalf of the Nazirite, since he sinned because of the corpse. On that day he must consecrate his head [again].
04Nm 6:12 He is to rededicate his time of consecration to the LORD and to bring a year-old male lamb as a restitution offering. But do not count the previous period, because his consecrated hair became defiled.
04Nm 6:13 "This is the law of the Nazirite: On the day his time of consecration is completed, he must be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04Nm 6:14 He is to present an offering to the LORD of one unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, one unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, one unblemished ram as a fellowship offering,
04Nm 6:15 along with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of unleavened cakes made from fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers coated with oil.
04Nm 6:16 "The priest is to present [these] before the LORD and sacrifice the Nazirite's sin offering and burnt offering.
04Nm 6:17 He will also offer the ram as a fellowship sacrifice to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened bread. Then the priest will offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering.
04Nm 6:18 "The Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head at the entrance to the tent of meeting, take the hair from his head, and put [it] on the fire under the fellowship sacrifice.
04Nm 6:19 The priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put [them] into the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated head.
04Nm 6:20 The priest is to wave them as a presentation offering before the LORD. It is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
04Nm 6:21 "This is the ritual of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD for his consecration, in addition to whatever else he can afford; he must fulfill whatever vow he makes in keeping with the ritual for his consecration."
04Nm 6:22 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 6:23 "Tell Aaron and his sons how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
04Nm 6:24 The LORD bless you and protect you;
04Nm 6:25 the LORD make His face shine on you, and be gracious to you;
04Nm 6:26 the LORD look with favor on you and give you peace.
04Nm 6:27 In this way they will put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them."
04Nm 7:1 On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils. After he anointed and consecrated these things,
04Nm 7:2 the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral houses, presented [an offering]. They were the tribal leaders who supervised the registration.
04Nm 7:3 They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and 12 oxen, a cart from every two leaders and an ox from each one, and presented them in front of the tabernacle.
04Nm 7:4 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 7:5 "Accept [these] from them to be used in the work of the tent of meeting, and give this offering to the Levites, to each [division] according to their service."
04Nm 7:6 So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
04Nm 7:7 He gave the Gershonites two carts and four oxen corresponding to their service,
04Nm 7:8 and gave the Merarites four carts and eight oxen corresponding to their service, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 7:9 But he did not give [any] to the Kohathites, since their responsibility was service related to the holy objects carried on their shoulders.
04Nm 7:10 The leaders also presented the dedication gift for the altar when it was anointed. The leaders presented their offerings in front of the altar.
04Nm 7:11 The LORD told Moses, "Each day have one leader present his offering for the dedication of the altar."
04Nm 7:12 The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah.

04Nm 7:89 When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim. He spoke to him [that way].
04Nm 8:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 8:2 "Speak to Aaron and tell him: When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to give light in front of the lampstand."
04Nm 8:3 So Aaron did this; he set up its lamps [to give light] in front of the lampstand just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:4 This is the way the lampstand was made: it was a hammered work of gold, hammered from its base to its flower petals. The lampstand was made according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses.
04Nm 8:5 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 8:6 "Take the Levites from among the Israelites and ceremonially cleanse them.
04Nm 8:7 This is what you must do to them for their purification: Sprinkle them with the purification water. Have them shave their entire bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
04Nm 8:8 "They are to take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
04Nm 8:9 Bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the entire Israelite community.
04Nm 8:10 Then present the Levites before the LORD, and have the Israelites lay their hands on them.
04Nm 8:11 Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a presentation offering from the Israelites, so that they may perform the LORD's work.
04Nm 8:12 Next the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. Sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.
04Nm 8:13 "You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and you are to present them before the LORD as a presentation offering.
04Nm 8:14 In this way you are to separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites so that the Levites will belong to Me.
04Nm 8:15 After that the Levites may come to serve [at] the tent of meeting, once you have ceremonially cleansed them and presented them as a presentation offering.
04Nm 8:16 For they have been exclusively assigned to Me from the Israelites. I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, every Israelite firstborn.
04Nm 8:17 For every firstborn among the Israelites is Mine, both man and animal. I consecrated them to Myself on the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt.
04Nm 8:18 But I have taken the Levites in place of every firstborn among the Israelites.
04Nm 8:19 From the Israelites, I have given the Levites exclusively to Aaron and his sons to perform the work for the Israelites at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary."
04Nm 8:20 Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community did [this] to the Levites. The Israelites did everything to them the LORD commanded Moses regarding the Levites.
04Nm 8:21 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them before the LORD as a presentation offering. Aaron also made atonement for them to ceremonially cleanse them.
04Nm 8:22 After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. So they did to them as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites.
04Nm 8:23 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 8:24 "In regard to the Levites: From 25 years old or more, a man enters the service in the work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 8:25 But at 50 years old he is to retire from his service in the work and no longer serve.
04Nm 8:26 He may assist his brothers to fulfill responsibilities at the tent of meeting, but he must not do the work. This is how you are to deal with the Levites regarding their duties."
04Nm 9:1 In the first month of the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt, the LORD told Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
04Nm 9:2 "The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time.
04Nm 9:3 You must observe it at its appointed time on the fourteenth day of this month at twilight; you are to observe it according to all its statutes and ordinances."
04Nm 9:4 So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover,
04Nm 9:5 and they observed it in the first month on the fourteenth day at twilight in the Wilderness of Sinai. The Israelites did everything as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 9:6 But there were [some] men who were unclean because of a human corpse, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. These men came before Moses and Aaron the same day
04Nm 9:7 and said to him, "We are unclean because of a human corpse. Why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD's offering at its appointed time with the [other] Israelites?"
04Nm 9:8 Moses replied to them, "Wait here until I hear what the LORD commands for you."
04Nm 9:9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 9:10 "Tell the Israelites: When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a corpse or is on a distant journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD.
04Nm 9:11 Such people are to observe it in the second month, on the fourteenth day at twilight. They are to eat the animal with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;
04Nm 9:12 they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes.
04Nm 9:13 "But the man who is ceremonially clean, is not on a journey, and yet fails to observe the Passover is to be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD's offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.
04Nm 9:14 "If a foreigner resides with you and wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreign resident and the native of the land."
04Nm 9:15 On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and it appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning.
04Nm 9:16 It remained that way continuously: the cloud would cover it, appearing like fire at night.
04Nm 9:17 Whenever the cloud was lifted up above the tent, the Israelites would set out; at the place where the cloud stopped, there the Israelites camped.
04Nm 9:18 At the LORD's command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD's command they camped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they camped.
04Nm 9:19 Even when the cloud stayed over the tabernacle many days, the Israelites carried out the LORD's requirement and did not set out.
04Nm 9:20 Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for [only] a few days. They would camp at the LORD's command and set out at the LORD's command.
04Nm 9:21 Sometimes the cloud remained [only] from evening until morning; when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out. Or if it remained a day and a night, they moved out when the cloud lifted.
04Nm 9:22 Whether it was two days, a month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. But when it was lifted, they set out.
04Nm 9:23 They camped at the LORD's command, and they set out at the LORD's command. They carried out the LORD's requirement according to His command through Moses.
04Nm 10:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 10:2 "Make two trumpets of hammered silver to summon the community and have the camps set out.
04Nm 10:3 When both are sounded in long blasts, the entire community is to gather before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04Nm 10:4 However, if one is sounded, only the leaders, the heads of Israel's clans, are to gather before you.
04Nm 10:5 "When you sound short blasts, the camps pitched on the east are to set out.
04Nm 10:6 When you sound short blasts a second time, the camps pitched on the south are to set out. Short blasts are to be sounded for them to set out.
04Nm 10:7 When calling the assembly together, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones.
04Nm 10:8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. Your use of these is a permanent statute throughout your generations.
04Nm 10:9 "When you enter into battle in your land against an adversary who is attacking you, sound short blasts on the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God and be delivered from your enemies.
04Nm 10:10 You are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your fellowship sacrifices and on your joyous occasions, your appointed festivals, and the beginning of each of your months. They will serve as a reminder for you before your God: I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 10:11 During the second year, in the second month on the twentieth [day] of the month, the cloud was lifted up above the tabernacle of the testimony.
04Nm 10:12 The Israelites traveled on from the Wilderness of Sinai, moving from one place to the next until the cloud stopped in the Wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 10:13 They set out for the first time according to the LORD's command through Moses.
04Nm 10:14 The military divisions of the camp of Judah with their banner set out first, and Nahshon son of Amminadab was over Judah's divisions.
04Nm 10:15 Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the Issachar tribe,
04Nm 10:16 and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the Zebulun tribe.
04Nm 10:17 The tabernacle was then taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting the tabernacle.
04Nm 10:18 The military divisions of the camp of Reuben with their banner set out, and Elizur son of Shedeur was over Reuben's division.
04Nm 10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of Simeon's tribe,
04Nm 10:20 and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
04Nm 10:21 The Kohathites then set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival.
04Nm 10:22 Next the military divisions of the camp of Ephraim with their banner set out, and Elishama son of Ammihud was over Ephraim's division.
04Nm 10:23 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
04Nm 10:24 and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
04Nm 10:25 The military divisions of the camp of Dan with their banner set out, serving as rearguard for all the camps, and Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was over Dan's division.
04Nm 10:26 Pagiel son of Ochran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
04Nm 10:27 and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
04Nm 10:28 This was the order of march for the Israelites by their military divisions as they set out.
04Nm 10:29 Moses said to Hobab, son of Moses' father-in-law Reuel the Midianite: "We're setting out for the place the LORD promised: 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel."
04Nm 10:30 But he replied to him, "I don't want to go. Instead, I will go to my own land and my relatives."
04Nm 10:31 "Please don't leave us," Moses said, "since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes.
04Nm 10:32 If you come with us, whatever good the LORD does for us we will do for you."
04Nm 10:33 They set out from the mountain of the LORD on a three-day journey to seek a resting place for them, with the ark of the LORD's covenant traveling ahead of them for the three days.
04Nm 10:34 Meanwhile, the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
04Nm 10:35 Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say: Arise, LORD! Let Your enemies be scattered, and those who hate You flee from Your presence.
04Nm 10:36 When it came to rest, he would say: Return, LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.
04Nm 11:1 Now the people began complaining openly before the LORD about hardship. When the LORD heard, His anger burned, and the fire from the LORD blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp.
04Nm 11:2 Then the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down.
04Nm 11:3 So that place was named Taberah, because the LORD's fire had blazed among them.
04Nm 11:4 Contemptible people among them had a strong craving [for other food]. The Israelites cried again and said, "Who will feed us meat?
04Nm 11:5 We remember the free fish we ate in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
04Nm 11:6 But now our appetite is gone; there's nothing to look at but this manna!"
04Nm 11:7 The manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of bdellium.
04Nm 11:8 The people walked around and gathered [it]. They ground [it] on a pair of grinding stones or crushed [it] in a mortar, then boiled [it] in a cooking pot and shaped it into cakes. It tasted like a pastry cooked with the finest oil.
04Nm 11:9 When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
04Nm 11:10 Moses heard the people, family after family, crying at the entrance of their tents. The LORD was very angry; Moses was also provoked.
04Nm 11:11 So Moses asked the LORD, "Why have You brought such trouble on Your servant? Why are You angry with me, and why do You burden me with all these people?
04Nm 11:12 Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth so You should tell me, 'Carry them at your breast, as a nursing woman carries a baby,' to the land that You swore to [give] their fathers?
04Nm 11:13 Where can I get meat to give all these people? For they are crying to me: 'Give us meat to eat!'
04Nm 11:14 "I can't carry all these people by myself. They are too much for me.
04Nm 11:15 If You are going to treat me like this, please kill me right now. If You are pleased with me, don't let me see my misery [any more]."
04Nm 11:16 The LORD answered Moses, "Bring Me 70 men from Israel known to you as elders and officers of the people. Take them to the tent of meeting and have them stand there with you.
04Nm 11:17 Then I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit who is on you and put [the Spirit] on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself.
04Nm 11:18 "Tell the people: Purify yourselves [in readiness] for tomorrow, and you will eat meat because you cried before the LORD: 'Who will feed us meat? We really had it good in Egypt.' The LORD will give you meat and you will eat.
04Nm 11:19 You will eat, not for one day, or two days, or five days, or 10 days, or 20 days,
04Nm 11:20 but for a whole month-- until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes nauseating to you-- because you have rejected the LORD who is among you, and cried to Him: 'Why did we ever leave Egypt?'"
04Nm 11:21 But Moses replied, "I'm in the middle of a people with 600,000 foot soldiers, yet You say, 'I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.'
04Nm 11:22 If flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?"
04Nm 11:23 The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD's power limited? You will see whether or not what I have promised will happen to you."
04Nm 11:24 Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. He brought 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.
04Nm 11:25 Then the LORD descended in the cloud and spoke to him. He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed [the Spirit] on the 70 elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they never did it again.
04Nm 11:26 Two men had remained in the camp, one named Eldad and the other Medad; the Spirit rested on them-- they were among those listed, but had not gone out to the tent-- and they prophesied in the camp.
04Nm 11:27 A young man ran and reported to Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
04Nm 11:28 Joshua son of Nun, assistant to Moses since his youth, responded, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"
04Nm 11:29 But Moses asked him, "Are you jealous on my account? If only all the LORD's people were prophets, and the LORD would place His Spirit on them."
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.
04Nm 11:31 A wind sent by the LORD came up and blew quail in from the sea; it dropped [them] at the camp all around, three feet off the ground, about a day's journey in every direction.
04Nm 11:32 The people were up all that day and night and all the next day gathering the quail-- the one who took the least gathered 33 bushels-- and they spread them out all around the camp.
04Nm 11:33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the LORD's anger burned against the people, and the LORD struck them with a very severe plague.
04Nm 11:34 So they named that place Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved [the meat].
04Nm 11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth and remained there.
04Nm 12:1 Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he married (for he had married a Cushite woman).
04Nm 12:2 They said, "Does the LORD speak only through Moses? Does He not also speak through us?" And the LORD heard [it].
04Nm 12:3 Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth.
04Nm 12:4 Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "You three come out to the tent of meeting." So the three of them went out.
04Nm 12:5 Then the LORD descended in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them came forward,
04Nm 12:6 He said: "Listen to what I say: If there is a prophet among you from the LORD, I make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.
04Nm 12:7 Not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My household.
04Nm 12:8 I speak with him directly, openly, and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. So why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?"
04Nm 12:9 The Lord's anger burned against them, and He left.
04Nm 12:10 As the cloud moved away from the tent, Miriam's [skin] suddenly became diseased, as [white] as snow. When Aaron turned toward her, he saw that she was diseased
04Nm 12:11 and said to Moses, "My lord, please don't hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed.
04Nm 12:12 Please don't let her be like a dead [baby] whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb."
04Nm 12:13 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "God, please heal her!"
04Nm 12:14 The LORD answered Moses, "If her father had merely spit in her face, wouldn't she remain in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in."
04Nm 12:15 So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was brought back in.
04Nm 12:16 After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 13:1 The LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 13:2 "Send men to scout out the land of Canaan I am giving to the Israelites. Send one man who is a leader among them from each of their ancestral tribes."
04Nm 13:3 Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran at the LORD's command. All the men were leaders in Israel.
04Nm 13:4 These were their names: Shammua son of Zaccur from the tribe of Reuben;
04Nm 13:5 Shaphat son of Hori from the tribe of Simeon;
04Nm 13:6 Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
04Nm 13:7 Igal son of Joseph from the tribe of Issachar;
04Nm 13:8 Hoshea son of Nun from the tribe of Ephraim;
04Nm 13:9 Palti son of Raphu from the tribe of Benjamin;
04Nm 13:10 Gaddiel son of Sodi from the tribe of Zebulun;
04Nm 13:11 Gaddi son of Susi from the tribe of Manasseh (from the tribe of Joseph);
04Nm 13:12 Ammiel son of Gemalli from the tribe of Dan;
04Nm 13:13 Sethur son of Michael from the tribe of Asher;
04Nm 13:14 Nahbi son of Vophsi from the tribe of Naphtali;
04Nm 13:15 Geuel son of Machi from the tribe of Gad.
04Nm 13:16 These were the names of the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and Moses renamed Hoshea son of Nun, Joshua.
04Nm 13:17 When Moses sent them to scout out the land of Canaan, he told them, "Go up this way to the Negev, then go up into the hill country.
04Nm 13:18 See what the land is like, and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.
04Nm 13:19 Is the land they live in good or bad? Are the cities they live in encampments or fortifications?
04Nm 13:20 Is the land fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous. Bring back some fruit from the land." It was the season for the first ripe grapes.
04Nm 13:21 So they went up and scouted out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob near the entrance to Hamath.
04Nm 13:22 They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were living. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
04Nm 13:23 When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which was carried on a pole by two men. [They] also [took] some pomegranates and figs.
04Nm 13:24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster [of grapes] the Israelites cut there.
04Nm 13:25 At the end of 40 days they returned from scouting out the land.
04Nm 13:26 The men went back to Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for them and the whole community, and they showed them the fruit of the land.
04Nm 13:27 They reported to Moses: "We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey, and here is some of its fruit.
04Nm 13:28 However, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We also saw the descendants of Anak there.
04Nm 13:29 The Amalekites are living in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan."
04Nm 13:30 Then Caleb quieted the people in the presence of Moses and said, "We must go up and take possession of the land because we can certainly conquer it!"
04Nm 13:31 But the men who had gone up with him responded, "We can't go up against the people because they are stronger than we are!"
04Nm 13:32 So they gave a negative report to the Israelites about the land they had scouted: "The land we passed through to explore is one that devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw in it are men of great size.
04Nm 13:33 We even saw the Nephilim there." (The offspring of Anak were descended from the Nephilim.) "To ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and we must have seemed the same to them."
04Nm 14:1 Then the whole community broke into loud cries, and the people wept that night.
04Nm 14:2 All the Israelites complained about Moses and Aaron, and the whole community told them, "If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!
04Nm 14:3 Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to die by the sword? Our wives and little children will become plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
04Nm 14:4 So they said to one another, "Let's appoint a leader and go back to Egypt."
04Nm 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell down with their faces [to the ground] in front of the whole assembly of the Israelite community.
04Nm 14:6 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who scouted out the land, tore their clothes
04Nm 14:7 and said to the entire Israelite community: "The land we passed through and explored is an extremely good land.
04Nm 14:8 If the LORD is pleased with us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and give it to us.
04Nm 14:9 Only don't rebel against the LORD, and don't be afraid of the people of the land, for we will devour them. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us. Don't be afraid of them!"
04Nm 14:10 While the whole community threatened to stone them, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 14:11 The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people despise Me? How long will they not trust in Me despite all the signs I have performed among them?
04Nm 14:12 I will strike them with a plague and destroy them. Then I will make you into a greater and mightier nation than they are."
04Nm 14:13 But Moses replied to the LORD, "The Egyptians will hear about it, for by Your strength You brought up this people from them.
04Nm 14:14 They will tell [it to] the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among these people, how You, Lord, are seen face to face, how Your cloud stands over them, and how You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
04Nm 14:15 If You kill this people with a single blow, the nations that have heard of Your fame will declare,
04Nm 14:16 'Since the LORD wasn't able to bring this people into the land He swore to [give] them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
04Nm 14:17 "So now, may My Lord's power be magnified just as You have spoken:
04Nm 14:18 The LORD is slow to anger and rich in faithful love, forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion. But He will not leave [the guilty] unpunished, bringing the consequences of the fathers' wrongdoing on the children to the third and fourth generation.
04Nm 14:19 Please pardon the wrongdoing of this people in keeping with the greatness of Your faithful love, just as You have forgiven them from Egypt until now."
04Nm 14:20 The LORD responded, "I have pardoned [them] as you requested.
04Nm 14:21 Yet as surely as I live and as the whole earth is filled with the LORD's glory,
04Nm 14:22 none of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tested Me these 10 times and did not obey Me,
04Nm 14:23 will ever see the land I swore to [give] their fathers. None of those who have despised Me will see it.
04Nm 14:24 But since My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me completely, I will bring him into the land where he has gone, and his descendants will inherit it.
04Nm 14:25 Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the lowlands, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea."
04Nm 14:26 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron:
04Nm 14:27 "How long [must I endure] this evil community that keeps complaining about Me? I have heard the Israelites' complaints that they make against Me.
04Nm 14:28 Tell them: As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you exactly as I heard you say.
04Nm 14:29 Your corpses will fall in this wilderness-- all of you who were registered [in the census], the entire number of you 20 years old or more-- because you have complained about Me.
04Nm 14:30 I swear that none of you will enter the land I promised to settle you in, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 14:31 I will bring your children whom you said would become plunder into the land you rejected, and they will enjoy it.
04Nm 14:32 But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness.
04Nm 14:33 Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for 40 years and bear the penalty for your acts of unfaithfulness until all your corpses lie [scattered] in the wilderness.
04Nm 14:34 You will bear the consequences of your sins 40 years based on the number of the 40 days that you scouted the land, a year for each day. You will know My displeasure.
04Nm 14:35 I, the LORD, have spoken. I swear that I will do this to the entire evil community that has conspired against Me. They will come to an end in the wilderness, and there they will die."
04Nm 14:36 So the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and who returned and incited the entire community to complain about him by spreading a bad report about the land--
04Nm 14:37 those men who spread the report about the land were struck down by the LORD.
04Nm 14:38 Only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to scout out the land.
04Nm 14:39 When Moses reported these words to all the Israelites, the people were overcome with grief.
04Nm 14:40 They got up early the next morning and went up the ridge of the hill country, saying, "Let's go to the place the LORD promised, for we were wrong."
04Nm 14:41 But Moses responded, "Why are you going against the LORD's command? It won't succeed.
04Nm 14:42 Don't go, because the LORD is not among you and you will be defeated by your enemies.
04Nm 14:43 The Amalekites and Canaanites are right in front of you, and you will fall by the sword. The LORD won't be with you, since you have turned from following Him."
04Nm 14:44 But they dared to go up the ridge of the hill country, even though the ark of the LORD's covenant and Moses did not leave the camp.
04Nm 14:45 Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that [part of the] hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them as far as Hormah.
04Nm 15:1 The LORD instructed Moses:
04Nm 15:2 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land I am giving you to settle in,
04Nm 15:3 and you make a fire offering to the LORD from the herd or flock-- either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering, or at your appointed festivals-- to produce a pleasing aroma for the LORD,
04Nm 15:4 the one presenting his offering to the LORD must also present a grain offering of two quarts of fine flour mixed with a quart of oil.
04Nm 15:5 Prepare a quart of wine as a drink offering with the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb.
04Nm 15:6 "If you prepare a grain offering with a ram, it must be four quarts of fine flour mixed with a third of a gallon of oil.
04Nm 15:7 Also present a third of a gallon of wine for a drink offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:8 "If you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow, or as a fellowship offering to the LORD,
04Nm 15:9 a grain offering of six quarts of fine flour mixed with two quarts of oil must be presented with the bull.
04Nm 15:10 Also present two quarts of wine as a drink offering. It is a fire offering of pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:11 This is to be done for each ox, ram, lamb, or goat.
04Nm 15:12 This is how you must prepare each of them, no matter how many.
04Nm 15:13 "Every Israelite is to prepare these things in this way when he presents a fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:14 When a foreigner resides with you or someone else is among you and wants to prepare a fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he is to do exactly as you do throughout your generations.
04Nm 15:15 The assembly is to have the same statute for both you and the foreign resident as a permanent statute throughout your generations. You and the foreigner will be alike before the LORD.
04Nm 15:16 The same law and the same ordinance will apply to both you and the foreigner who resides with you."
04Nm 15:17 The LORD instructed Moses:
04Nm 15:18 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land where I am bringing you,
04Nm 15:19 you are to offer a contribution to the LORD when you eat from the food of the land.
04Nm 15:20 You are to offer a loaf from your first batch of dough as a contribution; offer it just like a contribution from the threshing floor.
04Nm 15:21 Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD a contribution from the first batch of your dough.
04Nm 15:22 "When you sin unintentionally and do not obey all these commands that the LORD spoke to Moses--
04Nm 15:23 all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day the LORD issued the commands and onward throughout your generations--
04Nm 15:24 and if it was done unintentionally without the community's awareness, the entire community is to prepare one young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and one male goat as a sin offering.
04Nm 15:25 The priest must then make atonement for the entire Israelite community so that they may be forgiven, for the sin was unintentional. They are to bring their offering, one made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD for their unintentional sin.
04Nm 15:26 The entire Israelite community and the foreigner who resides among them will be forgiven, since it happened to all the people unintentionally.
04Nm 15:27 "If one person sins unintentionally, he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering.
04Nm 15:28 The priest must then make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person who acts in error sinning unintentionally, and when he makes atonement for him, he will be forgiven.
04Nm 15:29 You are to have the same law for the person who acts in error, whether he is an Israelite or a foreigner who lives among you.
04Nm 15:30 "But the person who acts defiantly, whether native or foreign resident, blasphemes the LORD. That person is to be cut off from his people.
04Nm 15:31 He will certainly be cut off, because he has despised the LORD's word and broken His command; his guilt remains on him."
04Nm 15:32 While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
04Nm 15:33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the entire community.
04Nm 15:34 They placed him in custody, because it had not been decided what should be done to him.
04Nm 15:35 Then the LORD told Moses, "The man is to be put to death. The entire community is to stone him outside the camp."
04Nm 15:36 So the entire community brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 15:37 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:38 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout their generations they are to make tassels for the corners of their garments, and put a blue cord on the tassel at [each] corner.
04Nm 15:39 These will serve as tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the LORD's commands and obey them and not become unfaithful by following your own heart and your own eyes.
04Nm 15:40 This way you will remember and obey all My commands and be holy to your God.
04Nm 15:41 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 16:1 Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took
04Nm 16:2 250 prominent Israelite men who were leaders of the community and representatives in the assembly, and they rebelled against Moses.
04Nm 16:3 They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, "You have gone too far! Everyone in the entire community is holy, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the LORD's assembly?"
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard [this], he fell facedown.
04Nm 16:5 Then he said to Korah and all his followers, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him, who is set apart, and [the one] He will let come near Him. He will let the one He chooses come near Him.
04Nm 16:6 Korah, you and all your followers are to do this: take firepans, and tomorrow
04Nm 16:7 place fire in them and put incense on them before the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is set apart. It is you Levites who have gone too far!"
04Nm 16:8 Moses also told Korah, "Now listen, Levites!
04Nm 16:9 Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the Israelite community to bring you near to Himself, to perform the work at the LORD's tabernacle, and to stand before the community to minister to them?
04Nm 16:10 He has brought you near, and all your fellow Levites who are with you, but you are seeking the priesthood as well.
04Nm 16:11 Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should complain about him?"
04Nm 16:12 Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, "We will not come!
04Nm 16:13 Is it not enough that you brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Do you also have to appoint yourself as ruler over us?
04Nm 16:14 Furthermore, you didn't bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey or give us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!"
04Nm 16:15 Then Moses became angry and said to the LORD, "Don't respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them."
04Nm 16:16 So Moses told Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow-- you, they, and Aaron.
04Nm 16:17 Each of you is to take his firepan, place incense on it, and present his firepan before the LORD-- 250 firepans. You and Aaron [are] each [to present] your firepan also."
04Nm 16:18 Each man took his firepan, placed fire in it, put incense on it, and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting along with Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 16:19 After Korah assembled the whole community against them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole community.
04Nm 16:20 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 16:21 "Separate yourselves from this community so I may consume them instantly."
04Nm 16:22 But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, "God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will you vent Your wrath on the whole community?"
04Nm 16:23 The LORD replied to Moses,
04Nm 16:24 "Tell the community: Get away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
04Nm 16:25 Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
04Nm 16:26 He warned the community, "Get away now from the tents of these wicked men. Don't touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."
04Nm 16:27 So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents with their wives, children, and infants.
04Nm 16:28 Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD sent me to do all these things and that it was not of my own will:
04Nm 16:29 If these men die [naturally] as all people would, and suffer the fate of all, then the LORD has not sent me.
04Nm 16:30 But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them along with all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have despised the LORD."
04Nm 16:31 Just as he finished speaking all these words, the ground beneath them split open.
04Nm 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, all Korah's people, and all [their] possessions.
04Nm 16:33 They went down alive into Sheol with all that belonged to them. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly.
04Nm 16:34 At their cries, all [the people of Israel] who were around them fled because they thought, "The earth may swallow us too!"
04Nm 16:35 Fire also came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were presenting the incense.
04Nm 16:36  Then the LORD spoke to Moses:
04Nm 16:37 "Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the firepans from the burning debris, because they are holy, and scatter the fire far away.
04Nm 16:38 As for the firepans of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, make them into hammered sheets as plating for the altar, for they presented them before the LORD, and the firepans are holy. They will be a sign to the Israelites."
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze firepans that those who were burned had presented, and they were hammered into plating for the altar,
04Nm 16:40 just as the LORD commanded him through Moses. It was to be a reminder for the Israelites that no unauthorized person outside the lineage of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD and become like Korah and his followers.
04Nm 16:41 The next day the entire Israelite community complained about Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the LORD's people!"
04Nm 16:42 When the community assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the LORD's glory appeared.
04Nm 16:43 Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,
04Nm 16:44 and the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:45 "Get away from this community so that I may consume them instantly." But they fell facedown.
04Nm 16:46 Then Moses told Aaron, "Take your firepan, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the community and make atonement for them, because wrath has come from the LORD; the plague has begun."
04Nm 16:47 So Aaron took his firepan as Moses had ordered, ran into the middle of the assembly, and saw that the plague had begun among the people. After he added incense, he made atonement for the people.
04Nm 16:48 He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was halted.
04Nm 16:49 But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who died because of the Korah incident.
04Nm 16:50 Aaron then returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, since the plague had been halted.
04Nm 17:1  The LORD instructed Moses:
04Nm 17:2 "Speak to the Israelites and take one staff from them for each ancestral house, 12 staffs from all the leaders of their ancestral houses. Write each man's name on his staff.
04Nm 17:3 Write Aaron's name on Levi's staff, because there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral house.
04Nm 17:4 Then place them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony where I meet with you.
04Nm 17:5 The staff of the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the Israelites' complaints that they have been making about you."
04Nm 17:6 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff, one for each of the leaders of their ancestral houses, 12 staffs [in all]. Aaron's staff was among them.
04Nm 17:7 Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
04Nm 17:8 The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds!
04Nm 17:9 Moses then brought out all the staffs from the LORD's presence to all the Israelites. They saw [them], and each man took his own staff.
04Nm 17:10 The LORD told Moses, "Put Aaron's rod back in front of the testimony to be kept as a sign for the rebels, so that you may put an end to their complaints before Me, or else they will die."
04Nm 17:11 So Moses did as the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 17:12 Then the Israelites declared to Moses, "Look, we're perishing! We're lost; we're all lost!
04Nm 17:13 Anyone who comes near the LORD's tabernacle will die. Will we all perish?"
04Nm 18:1 The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and your ancestral house will be responsible for sin against the sanctuary. You and your sons will be responsible for sin involving your priesthood.
04Nm 18:2 But also bring your brothers with you from the tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, so they may join you and serve with you and your sons in front of the tent of the testimony.
04Nm 18:3 They are to perform duties for you and for the whole tent. They must not come near the sanctuary equipment or the altar; otherwise, both they and you will die.
04Nm 18:4 They are to join you and guard the tent of meeting, doing all the work at the tent, but no unauthorized person may come near you.
04Nm 18:5 "You are to guard the sanctuary and the altar so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again.
04Nm 18:6 Look, I have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift for you, assigned by the LORD to work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:7 But you and your sons will carry out your priestly responsibilities for everything concerning the altar and for what is inside the veil, and you will do that work. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but an unauthorized person who comes near [the sanctuary] will be put to death."
04Nm 18:8 Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, "Look, I have put you in charge of the contributions brought to Me. As for all the holy offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a perpetual statute.
04Nm 18:9 A portion of the holiest offerings [kept] from the fire will be yours; every one of their offerings that they give Me, whether the grain offering, sin offering, or restitution offering will be most holy for you and your sons.
04Nm 18:10 You are to eat it as a most holy offering. Every male may eat it; it is to be holy to you.
04Nm 18:11 "The contribution of their gifts also belongs to you. I have given all the Israelites' presentation offerings to you and to your sons and daughters as a perpetual statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your house may eat it.
04Nm 18:12 I am giving you all the best of the fresh olive oil, new wine, and grain, which the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits.
04Nm 18:13 The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, belong to you. Every clean person in your house may eat them.
04Nm 18:14 "Everything in Israel that is permanently dedicated [to the LORD] belongs to you.
04Nm 18:15 The firstborn of every living thing, man or animal, presented to the LORD belongs to you. But you must certainly redeem the firstborn of man, and redeem the firstborn of an unclean animal.
04Nm 18:16 You will pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver by the standard sanctuary shekel, which is 20 gerahs.
04Nm 18:17 "However, you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as a fire offering for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 18:18 But their meat belongs to you. It belongs to you like the breast of the presentation offering and the right thigh.
04Nm 18:19 "I give to you and to your sons and daughters all the holy contributions that the Israelites present to the LORD as a perpetual statute. It is a perpetual covenant of salt before the LORD for you as well as your offspring."
04Nm 18:20 The LORD told Aaron, "You will not have an inheritance in their land; there will be no portion among them for you. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
04Nm 18:21 "Look, I have given the Levites every tenth in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the work of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:22 The Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting, or they will incur guilt and die.
04Nm 18:23 The Levites will do the work of the tent of meeting, and they will bear the [consequences] of their sin. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites; this is a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
04Nm 18:24 For I have given them the tenth that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution for [their] inheritance. That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites."
04Nm 18:25 The LORD instructed Moses,
04Nm 18:26 "Speak to the Levites and tell them: When you receive from the Israelites the tenth that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD-- a tenth of the tenth.
04Nm 18:27 Your offering will be credited to you as if [it were your] grain from the threshing floor or the full harvest from the winepress.
04Nm 18:28 You are to present an offering to the LORD from every tenth you receive from the Israelites. Give some of it to Aaron the priest as an offering to the LORD.
04Nm 18:29 You must present the entire offering due the LORD from all your gifts. The best part of the tenth is to be consecrated.
04Nm 18:30 "Tell them further: Once you have presented the best part of the tenth, and it is credited to you Levites as the produce of the threshing floor or the winepress,
04Nm 18:31 then you and your household may eat it anywhere. It is your wage in return for your work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:32 You will not incur guilt because of it once you have presented the best part of it, but you must not defile the Israelites' holy offerings, so that you will not die."
04Nm 19:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 19:2 "This is the legal statute that the LORD has commanded: Instruct the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red cow that has no defect and has never been yoked.
04Nm 19:3 Give it to Eleazar the priest, and he will have it brought outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04Nm 19:4 Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 19:5 The cow must be burned in his sight. Its hide, flesh, and blood, are to be burned along with its dung.
04Nm 19:6 The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson yarn, and throw [them] onto the fire where the cow is burning.
04Nm 19:7 Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:8 The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he will remain unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:9 "A man who is clean is to gather up the cow's ashes and deposit them outside the camp in a ceremonially clean place. The ashes must be kept by the Israelite community for [preparing] the water [to remove] impurity; it is a sin offering.
04Nm 19:10 Then the one who gathers up the cow's ashes must wash his clothes, and he will remain unclean until evening. This is a perpetual statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner who resides among them.
04Nm 19:11 "The person who touches any human corpse will be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:12 He is to purify himself with the water on the third day and the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.
04Nm 19:13 Anyone who touches a body of a person who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person will be cut off from Israel. He remains unclean because the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, and his uncleanness is still on him.
04Nm 19:14 "This is the law when a person dies in a tent: everyone who enters the tent and everyone who is [already] in the tent will be unclean for seven days,
04Nm 19:15 and any open container without a lid tied on it is unclean.
04Nm 19:16 Anyone in the open field who touches a person who has been killed by the sword or has died, or a human bone, or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:17 For [the purification of] the unclean person, they are to take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, [put them] in a jar, and add fresh water to them.
04Nm 19:18 A person who is clean is to take hyssop, dip [it] in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He is also to sprinkle the one who touched a bone, a grave, a corpse, or a person who had been killed.
04Nm 19:19 "The one who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and the seventh day. After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day, the one being purified must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be clean by evening.
04Nm 19:20 But a person who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person will be cut off from the assembly because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
04Nm 19:21 This is a perpetual statute for them. The person who sprinkles the water for impurity is to wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:22 Anything the unclean person touches will become unclean, and anyone who touches [it] will be unclean until evening."
04Nm 20:1 The entire Israelite community entered the Wilderness of Zin in the first month, and they settled in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
04Nm 20:2 There was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 20:3 The people quarreled with Moses and said, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD.
04Nm 20:4 Why have you brought the LORD's assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
04Nm 20:5 Why have you led us up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It's not a place of grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink!"
04Nm 20:6 Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting. They fell down with their faces [to the ground], and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
04Nm 20:7 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 20:8 "Take the staff and assemble the community. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will yield its water. You will bring out water for them from the rock and provide drink for the community and their livestock."
04Nm 20:9 So Moses took the staff from the LORD's presence just as He had commanded him.
04Nm 20:10 Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels! Must we bring water out of this rock for you?"
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
04Nm 20:12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land I have given them."
04Nm 20:13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD, and He showed His holiness to them.
04Nm 20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, "This is what your brother Israel says, 'You know all the hardships that have overtaken us.
04Nm 20:15 Our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt many years, but the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly.
04Nm 20:16 When we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an Angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the border of your territory.
04Nm 20:17 Please let us travel through your land. We won't travel through [any] field or vineyard, or drink [any] well water. We will travel the King's Highway; we won't turn to the right or the left until we have traveled through your territory.'"
04Nm 20:18 But Edom answered him, "You must not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword."
04Nm 20:19 "We will go on the main road," the Israelites replied to them, "and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay its price. There will be no problem; only let us travel through on foot."
04Nm 20:20 Yet Edom insisted, "You must not travel through." And they came out to confront them with a large force of heavily-armed people.
04Nm 20:21 Edom refused to allow Israel to travel through their territory, and Israel turned away from them.
04Nm 20:22 After they set out from Kadesh, the entire Israelite community came to Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:23 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor on the border of the land of Edom,
04Nm 20:24 "Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land I have given the Israelites, because you both rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
04Nm 20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:26 Remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered [to his people] and die there."
04Nm 20:27 So Moses did as the LORD commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
04Nm 20:28 After Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
04Nm 20:29 When the whole community saw that Aaron had passed away, the entire house of Israel mourned for him 30 days.
04Nm 21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming on the Atharim road, he fought against Israel and captured some prisoners.
04Nm 21:2 Then Israel made a vow to the LORD, "If You will deliver this people into our hands, we will completely destroy their cities."
04Nm 21:3 The LORD listened to Israel's request, the Canaanites were defeated, and Israel completely destroyed them and their cities. So they named the place Hormah.
04Nm 21:4 Then they set out from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to bypass the land of Edom, but the people became impatient because of the journey.
04Nm 21:5 The people spoke against God and Moses: "Why have you led us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!"
04Nm 21:6 Then the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people, and they bit them so that many Israelites died.
04Nm 21:7 The people then came to Moses and said, "We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD so that He will take the snakes away from us." And Moses interceded for the people.
04Nm 21:8 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake [image] and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will recover.
04Nm 21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. Whenever someone was bitten, and he looked at the bronze snake, he recovered.
04Nm 21:10 The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 21:11 They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness that borders Moab on the east.
04Nm 21:12 From there they went and camped at Zered Valley.
04Nm 21:13 They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon [River], in the wilderness that extends from the Amorite border, because the Arnon was the Moabite border between Moab and the Amorites.
04Nm 21:14 Therefore it is stated in the Book of the LORD's Wars: Waheb in Suphah and the ravines of the Arnon,
04Nm 21:15 even the slopes of the ravines that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.
04Nm 21:16 From there [they went] to Beer, the well the LORD told Moses about, "Gather the people so I may give them water."
04Nm 21:17 Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, well-- sing to it!
04Nm 21:18 The princes dug the well; The nobles of the people hollowed it out with a scepter and with their staffs. [They went] from the wilderness to Mattanah,
04Nm 21:19 from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
04Nm 21:20 from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of Moab near the Pisgah highlands that overlook the wasteland.
04Nm 21:21 Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:
04Nm 21:22 "Let us travel through your land. We won't go into the fields or vineyards. We won't drink [any] well water. We will travel the King's Highway until we have traveled through your territory."
04Nm 21:23 But Sihon would not let Israel travel through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.
04Nm 21:24 Israel struck him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, [but only up] to the Ammonite border, because it was fortified.
04Nm 21:25 Israel took all the cities and lived in all these Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all its villages.
04Nm 21:26 Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken control of all his land as far as the Arnon.
04Nm 21:27 Therefore the poets say: Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be restored.
04Nm 21:28 For fire came out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of Arnon's heights.
04Nm 21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh! He gave up his sons as refugees, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the Amorite king.
04Nm 21:30 We threw them down; Heshbon has been destroyed as far as Dibon. We caused desolation as far as Nophah, which reaches as far as Medeba.
04Nm 21:31 So Israel lived in the Amorites' land.
04Nm 21:32 After Moses sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04Nm 21:33 Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out against them with his whole army to do battle at Edrei.
04Nm 21:34 But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you along with his whole army and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon."
04Nm 21:35 So they struck him, his sons, and his whole army until no one was left, and they took possession of his land.
04Nm 22:1 The Israelites traveled on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan across from Jericho.
04Nm 22:2 Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
04Nm 22:3 Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous, and dreaded the Israelites.
04Nm 22:4 So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde will devour everything around us like an ox eats up the green plants in the field." Since Balak son of Zippor was Moab's king at that time,
04Nm 22:5 he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people. Balak said to him: "Look, a people has come out of Egypt; they cover the surface of the land and are living right across from me.
04Nm 22:6 Please come and put a curse on these people for me because they are more powerful than I am. I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed."
04Nm 22:7 The elders of Moab and Midian departed with fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and reported Balak's words to him.
04Nm 22:8 He said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will give you the answer the LORD tells me." So the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam.
04Nm 22:9 Then God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
04Nm 22:10 Balaam replied to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent [this message] to me:
04Nm 22:11 'Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.'"
04Nm 22:12 Then God said to Balaam, "You are not to go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed."
04Nm 22:13 So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak's officials, "Go back to your land, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
04Nm 22:14 The officials of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and reported, "Balaam refused to come with us."
04Nm 22:15 Balak sent officials again who were more numerous and higher in rank than the others.
04Nm 22:16 They came to Balaam and said to him, "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: 'Let nothing keep you from coming to me,
04Nm 22:17 for I will greatly honor you and do whatever you ask me. So please come and put a curse on these people for me!'"
04Nm 22:18 But Balaam responded to the servants of Balak, "If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the command of the LORD my God to do [anything] small or great.
04Nm 22:19 Please stay here overnight as the others did, so that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me."
04Nm 22:20 God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you."
04Nm 22:21 When he got up in the morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the officials of Moab.
04Nm 22:22 But God was incensed that Balaam was going, and the Angel of the LORD took His stand on the path to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
04Nm 22:23 When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing on the path with a drawn sword in His hand, she turned off the path and went into the field. So Balaam hit her to return her to the path.
04Nm 22:24 Then the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between the vineyards, with a stone wall on either side.
04Nm 22:25 The donkey saw the Angel of the LORD and pressed herself against the wall, squeezing Balaam's foot against it. So he hit her once again.
04Nm 22:26 The Angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or the left.
04Nm 22:27 When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she crouched down under Balaam. So he became furious and beat the donkey with his stick.
04Nm 22:28 Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she asked Balaam, "What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?"
04Nm 22:29 Balaam answered the donkey, "You made me look like a fool. If I had a sword in my hand, I'd kill you now!"
04Nm 22:30 But the donkey said, "Am I not the donkey you've ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?" "No," he replied.
04Nm 22:31 Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the path with a drawn sword in His hand. Balaam knelt and bowed with his face [to the ground].
04Nm 22:32 The Angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look, I came out to oppose you, because what you are doing is evil in My sight.
04Nm 22:33 The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, I would have killed you by now and let her live."
04Nm 22:34 Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the path to confront me. And now, if it is evil in Your sight, I will go back."
04Nm 22:35 Then the Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but you are to say only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials.
04Nm 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border at the edge of his territory.
04Nm 22:37 Balak asked Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"
04Nm 22:38 Balaam said to him, "Look, I have come to you, but can I say anything I want? I must speak only the message God puts in my mouth."
04Nm 22:39 So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
04Nm 22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent for Balaam and the officials who were with him.
04Nm 22:41 In the morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him to Bamoth-baal. From there he saw the outskirts of the people's camp.
04Nm 23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04Nm 23:2 So Balak did as Balaam directed, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:3 Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone. Maybe the LORD will meet with me. I will tell you whatever He reveals to me." So he went to a barren hill.
04Nm 23:4 God met with him and Balaam said to Him, "I have arranged seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
04Nm 23:5 Then the LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak and say what I tell you."
04Nm 23:6 So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with all the officials of Moab.
04Nm 23:7 Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak brought me from Aram; the king of Moab, from the eastern mountains: "Come, put a curse on Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel!"
04Nm 23:8 How can I curse someone God has not cursed? How can I denounce someone the LORD has not denounced?
04Nm 23:9 I see them from the top of rocky cliffs, and I watch them from the hills. There is a people living alone; it does not consider itself among the nations.
04Nm 23:10 Who has counted the dust of Jacob or numbered the dust clouds of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright; let the end of my [life] be like theirs.
04Nm 23:11 "What have you done to me?" Balak asked Balaam. "I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you have only blessed [them]!"
04Nm 23:12 He answered, "Shouldn't I say exactly what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
04Nm 23:13 Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the outskirts of their camp; you won't see all of them. From there, put a curse on them for me."
04Nm 23:14 So Balak took him to Lookout Field on top of Pisgah, built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here by your burnt offering while I seek [the LORD] over there."
04Nm 23:16 The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth. Then He said, "Return to Balak and say what I tell you."
04Nm 23:17 So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"
04Nm 23:18 Balaam proclaimed his poem: Balak, get up and listen; son of Zippor, pay attention to what I say!
04Nm 23:19 God is not a man who lies, or a son of man who changes His mind. Does He speak and not act, or promise and not fulfill?
04Nm 23:20 I have indeed received [a command] to bless; since He has blessed, I cannot change it.
04Nm 23:21 He considers no disaster for Jacob; He sees no trouble for Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and there is rejoicing over the King among them.
04Nm 23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; He is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
04Nm 23:23 There is no magic curse against Jacob and no divination against Israel. It will now be said about Jacob and Israel, "What [great things] God has done!"
04Nm 23:24 A people rise up like a lioness; They rouse themselves like a lion. They will not lie down until they devour the prey and drink the blood of the slain.
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak told Balaam, "Don't curse them and don't bless them!"
04Nm 23:26 But Balaam answered him, "Didn't I tell you: Whatever the LORD says, I must do?"
04Nm 23:27 Again Balak said to Balaam, "Please come. I will take you to another place. Maybe it will be agreeable to God that you can put a curse on them for me there."
04Nm 23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.
04Nm 23:29 Balaam told Balak, "Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04Nm 23:30 So Balak did as Balaam said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 24:1 Since Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go to seek omens as on previous occasions, but turned toward the wilderness.
04Nm 24:2 When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God descended on him,
04Nm 24:3 and he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened,
04Nm 24:4 the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls [into a trance] with [his] eyes uncovered:
04Nm 24:5 How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings, Israel.
04Nm 24:6 they stretch out like river valleys, like gardens beside a stream, like aloes the LORD has planted, like cedars beside the water.
04Nm 24:7 Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will be by abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted.
04Nm 24:8 God brought him out of Egypt; He is like the horns of a wild ox for them. He will feed on enemy nations and gnaw their bones; he will strike [them] with his arrows.
04Nm 24:9 He crouches, he lies down like a lion or a lioness-- who dares to rouse him? Those who bless you will be blessed, and those who curse you will be cursed.
04Nm 24:10 Then Balak became furious with Balaam, struck his hands together, and said to him, "I summoned you to put a curse on my enemies, but instead, you have blessed [them these three times].
04Nm 24:11 Now go to your home! I said I would reward you richly, but look, the LORD has denied you a reward."
04Nm 24:12 Balaam answered Balak, "Didn't I previously tell the messengers you sent me:
04Nm 24:13 If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the LORD's command, to do [anything] good or bad of my own will? I will say whatever the LORD says.
04Nm 24:14 Now I am going back to my people, but first, let me warn you what these people will do to your people in the future."
04Nm 24:15 Then he proclaimed his poem: The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened;
04Nm 24:16 the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God and has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls [into a trance] with [his] eyes uncovered:
04Nm 24:17 I see him, but not now; I perceive him, but not near. A star will come from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will smash the forehead of Moab and strike down all the Shethites.
04Nm 24:18 Edom will become a possession; Seir will become a possession of its enemies, but Israel will be triumphant.
04Nm 24:19 One who comes from Jacob will rule; he will destroy the city's survivors.
04Nm 24:20 Then Balaam saw Amalek and proclaimed his poem: Amalek was first among the nations, but his future is destruction.
04Nm 24:21 Next he saw the Kenites and proclaimed his poem: Your dwelling place is enduring; your nest is set in the cliffs.
04Nm 24:22 Kain will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.
04Nm 24:23 Once more he proclaimed his poem: Ah, who can live when God does this?
04Nm 24:24 Ships will come from the coast of Kittim; they will afflict Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to destruction.
04Nm 24:25 Balaam then arose and went back to his homeland, and Balak also went his way.
04Nm 25:1 While Israel was staying in Acacia Grove, the people began to have sexual relations with the women of Moab.
04Nm 25:2 The women invited them to the sacrifices for their gods, and the people ate and bowed in worship to their gods.
04Nm 25:3 So Israel aligned itself with Baal of Peor, and the LORD's anger burned against Israel.
04Nm 25:4 The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD so that His burning anger may turn away from Israel."
04Nm 25:5 So Moses told Israel's judges, "Kill each of the men who aligned themselves with Baal of Peor."
04Nm 25:6 An Israelite man came bringing a Midianite woman to his relatives in the sight of Moses and the whole Israelite community while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
04Nm 25:7 When Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw [this], he got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
04Nm 25:8 followed the Israelite man into the tent, and drove it through both the Israelite man and the woman-- through her belly. Then the plague on the Israelites was stopped,
04Nm 25:9 but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
04Nm 25:10 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 25:11 "Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the Israelites because he was zealous among them with My zeal, so that I did not destroy the Israelites in My zeal.
04Nm 25:12 Therefore declare: I grant him My covenant of peace.
04Nm 25:13 It will be a covenant of perpetual priesthood for him and his descendants, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites."
04Nm 25:14 The name of the slain Israelite man, who was struck dead with the Midianite woman, was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite ancestral house.
04Nm 25:15 The name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal head of an ancestral house in Midian.
04Nm 25:16 The LORD told Moses:
04Nm 25:17 "Attack the Midianites and strike them dead.
04Nm 25:18 For they attacked you with the treachery that they used against you in the Peor incident. They did the same in the case involving their sister Cozbi, daughter of the Midianite leader who was killed the day the plague came at Peor."
04Nm 26:1 After the plague, the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
04Nm 26:2 "Take a census of the entire Israelite community by their ancestral houses of those 20 years old or more who can serve in Israel's army."
04Nm 26:3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest said to them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho,
04Nm 26:4 "[Take a census of] those 20 years old or more, as the LORD had commanded Moses and the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt."
04Nm 26:5 Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. Reuben's descendants: the Hanochite clan [from] Hanoch; the Palluite clan from Pallu;
04Nm 26:6 the Hezronite clan from Hezron; the Carmite clan from Carmi.
04Nm 26:7 These were the Reubenite clans, and their registered men numbered 43,730.
04Nm 26:8 The son of Pallu was Eliab.
04Nm 26:9 The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. (It was Dathan and Abiram, chosen by the community, who fought against Moses and Aaron; they and Korah's followers fought against the LORD.
04Nm 26:10 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, when his followers died and the fire consumed 250 men. They [serve as] a warning sign.
04Nm 26:11 The sons of Korah, however, did not die.)

04Nm 26:33 Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons-- only daughters. The names of Zelophehad's daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
04Nm 26:34 These were Manasseh's clans, numbered by their registered men: 52,700.
04Nm 26:35 These were Ephraim's descendants by their clans: the Shuthelahite clan from Shuthelah; the Becherite clan from Becher; the Tahanite clan from Tahan.

04Nm 26:48 Naphtali's descendants by their clans: the Jahzeelite clan from Jahzeel; the Gunite clan from Guni;
04Nm 26:49 the Jezerite clan from Jezer; the Shillemite clan from Shillem.
04Nm 26:50 These were the Naphtali clans numbered by their registered men: 45,400.
04Nm 26:51 These registered Israelite men numbered 601,730.
04Nm 26:52 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 26:53 "The land is to be divided among them as an inheritance based on the number of names.
04Nm 26:54 Increase the inheritance for a large [tribe], and decrease it for a small one. Each is to be given its inheritance according to those who were registered in it.
04Nm 26:55 The land must be divided by lot; they will receive an inheritance according to the names of their ancestral tribes.
04Nm 26:56 Each inheritance will be divided by lot among the larger and smaller [tribes]."
04Nm 26:57 These were the Levites registered by their clans: the Gershonite clan from Gershon; the Kohathite clan from Kohath; the Merarite clan from Merari.
04Nm 26:58 These were the Levite family groups: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, and the Korahite clan. Kohath was the ancestor of Amram.
04Nm 26:59 The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, born to Levi in Egypt. She bore to Amram: Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.
04Nm 26:60 Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar were born to Aaron,
04Nm 26:61 but Nadab and Abihu died when they presented unauthorized fire before the LORD.
04Nm 26:62 Those registered were 23,000, every male one month old or more; they were not registered among the [other] Israelites, because no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites.
04Nm 26:63 These were the ones registered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they registered the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho.
04Nm 26:64 But among them there was not one of those who had been registered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they registered the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 26:65 For the LORD had said to them that they would all die in the wilderness. None of them was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 27:1 The daughters of Zelophehad approached; [Zelophehad was the] son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh from the clans of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
04Nm 27:2 They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the entire community at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among Korah's followers, who gathered together against the LORD. Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons.
04Nm 27:4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan? Since he had no son, give us property among our father's brothers."
04Nm 27:5 Moses brought their case before the LORD,
04Nm 27:6 and the LORD answered him,
04Nm 27:7 "What Zelophehad's daughters say is correct. You are to give them hereditary property among their father's brothers and transfer their father's inheritance to them.
04Nm 27:8 Tell the Israelites: When a man dies without having a son, transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
04Nm 27:9 If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
04Nm 27:10 If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
04Nm 27:11 If his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative of his clan, and he will take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites as the LORD commanded Moses."
04Nm 27:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up this mountain of the Abarim [range] and see the land that I have given the Israelites.
04Nm 27:13 After you have seen it, you will also be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was.
04Nm 27:14 When the community quarreled in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My command to show My holiness in their sight at the waters." Those were the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.
04Nm 27:15 So Moses appealed to the LORD,
04Nm 27:16 "May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the community
04Nm 27:17 who will go out before them and come back in before them, and who will bring them out and bring them in, so that the LORD's community won't be like sheep without a shepherd."
04Nm 27:18 The LORD replied to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man who has the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him.
04Nm 27:19 Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole community, and commission him in their sight.
04Nm 27:20 Confer some of your authority on him so that the entire Israelite community will obey [him].
04Nm 27:21 He will stand before Eleazar who will consult the LORD for him with the decision of the Urim. He and all the Israelites with him, even the entire community, will go out and come back in at his command."
04Nm 27:22 Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua, had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire community,
04Nm 27:23 laid his hands on him, and commissioned him, as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
04Nm 28:1 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 28:2 "Command the Israelites and say to them: Be sure to present to Me at its appointed time My offering and My food as My fire offering, a pleasing aroma to Me.
04Nm 28:3 And say to them: This is the fire offering you are to present to the LORD: "Each day [present] two unblemished year-old male lambs as a regular burnt offering.
04Nm 28:4 Offer one lamb in the morning and the other lamb at twilight,
04Nm 28:5 along with two quarts of fine flour for a grain offering mixed with a quart of beaten olive oil.
04Nm 28:6 It is a regular burnt offering established at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD.
04Nm 28:7 The drink offering is to be a quart with each lamb. Pour out the offering of beer to the LORD in the sanctuary area.
04Nm 28:8 Offer the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering as in the morning. It is a fire offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 28:9 "On the Sabbath day [present] two unblemished year-old male lambs, four quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering.
04Nm 28:10 It is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04Nm 28:11 "At the beginning of each of your months present a burnt offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 28:12 with six quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each bull, four quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for the ram,
04Nm 28:13 and two quarts of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb. It is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the LORD.
04Nm 28:14 Their drink offerings are to be two quarts of wine with each bull, one and a third quarts with the ram, and one quart with each male lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering for all the months of the year.
04Nm 28:15 And one male goat is to be offered as a sin offering to the Lord, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its drink offering.
04Nm 28:16 "The Passover to the LORD comes in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month.
04Nm 28:17 On the fifteenth day of this month there will be a festival; unleavened bread is to be eaten for seven days.
04Nm 28:18 On the first day there is to be a sacred assembly; you are not to do any daily work.

04Nm 29:7 "You are to hold a sacred assembly on the tenth [day] of this seventh month and practice self-denial; you must not do any work.
04Nm 29:8 Present a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma: one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old. [All] your animals are to be unblemished.

04Nm 29:23 "On the fourth day [present] 10 bulls, two rams, 14 male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 29:24 with their grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in proportion to their number.
04Nm 29:25 Also [offer] one male goat as a sin offering. These are in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 29:26 "On the fifth day [present] nine bulls, two rams, 14 male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 29:27 with their grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in proportion to their number.
04Nm 29:28 Also [offer] one male goat as a sin offering. These are in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 29:29 "On the sixth day [present] eight bulls, two rams, 14 male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 29:30 with their grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in proportion to their number.
04Nm 29:31 Also [offer] one male goat as a sin offering. These are in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 29:32 "On the seventh day [present] seven bulls, two rams, and 14 male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 29:33 with their grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in proportion to their number.
04Nm 29:34 Also [offer] one male goat as a sin offering. These are in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 29:35 "On the eighth day you are to hold a solemn assembly; you are not to do any daily work.
04Nm 29:36 Present a burnt offering, a fire offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD: one bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old-- [all] unblemished--
04Nm 29:37 with their grain and drink offerings for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in proportion to their number.
04Nm 29:38 Also [offer] one male goat as a sin offering. These are in addition to the regular burnt offering with its grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 29:39 "You must offer these to the LORD at your appointed times in addition to your vow and freewill offerings, whether burnt, grain, drink, or fellowship offerings."
04Nm 29:40  So Moses told the Israelites everything the LORD had commanded him.
04Nm 30:1 Moses told the leaders of the Israelite tribes, "This is what the LORD has commanded:
04Nm 30:2 When a man makes a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to put himself under an obligation, he must not break his word; he must do whatever he has promised.
04Nm 30:3 "When a woman in her father's house during her youth makes a vow to the LORD or puts [herself] under an obligation,
04Nm 30:4 and her father hears about her vow or the obligation she put herself under, and he says nothing to her, all her vows and every obligation she put herself under are binding.
04Nm 30:5 But if her father prohibits her on the day he hears [about it], none of her vows and none of the obligations she put herself under are binding. The LORD will absolve her because her father has prohibited her.
04Nm 30:6 "If a woman marries while her vows or the rash commitment she herself made are binding,
04Nm 30:7 and her husband hears [about it] and says nothing to her when he finds out, her vows are binding, and the obligations she put herself under are binding.
04Nm 30:8 But if her husband prohibits her when he hears [about it], he will cancel her vow that is binding or the rash commitment she herself made, and the LORD will forgive her.
04Nm 30:9 "Any vow a widow or divorc? put herself under is binding on her.
04Nm 30:10 "If a woman in her husband's house has made a vow or put herself under an obligation with an oath,
04Nm 30:11 and her husband hears [about it], says nothing to her, and does not prohibit her, all her vows are binding, and every obligation she put herself under is binding.
04Nm 30:12 But if her husband cancels them on the day he hears [about it], nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or her obligation, is binding. Her husband has canceled them, and the LORD will absolve her.
04Nm 30:13 Her husband may confirm or cancel any vow or any sworn obligation to deny herself.
04Nm 30:14 If her husband says nothing at all to her from day to day, he confirms all her vows and obligations, which are binding. He has confirmed them because he said nothing to her when he heard [about them].
04Nm 30:15 But if he cancels them after he hears [about them], he will be responsible for her commitment."
04Nm 30:16 These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses concerning [the relationship] between a man and his wife, or between a father and his daughter in his house during her youth.
04Nm 31:1 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 31:2 "Execute vengeance for the Israelites against the Midianites. After that, you will be gathered to your people."
04Nm 31:3 So Moses spoke to the people, "Equip some of your men for war. They will go against Midian to inflict the LORD's vengeance on them.
04Nm 31:4 Send 1,000 men to war from each Israelite tribe."
04Nm 31:5 So 1,000 were recruited from each Israelite tribe out of the thousands in Israel-- 12,000 equipped for war.
04Nm 31:6 Moses sent 1,000 from each tribe to war. They went with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, in whose care were the holy objects and signal trumpets.
04Nm 31:7 They waged war against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed every male.
04Nm 31:8 Along with the others slain by them, they killed the Midianite kings-- Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
04Nm 31:9 The Israelites took the Midianite women and their children captive, and they plundered all their cattle, flocks, and property.
04Nm 31:10 Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites lived, as well as all their encampments,
04Nm 31:11 and took away all the spoils of war and the captives, both human and animal.
04Nm 31:12 They brought the prisoners, animals, and spoils of war to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the Israelite community at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho.
04Nm 31:13 Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
04Nm 31:14 But Moses became furious with the officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, who were returning from the military campaign.
04Nm 31:15 "Have you let every female live?" he asked them.
04Nm 31:16 "Yet they are the ones who, at Balaam's advice, incited the Israelites to unfaithfulness against the LORD in the Peor incident, so that the plague came against the LORD's community.
04Nm 31:17 So now, kill all the male children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man,
04Nm 31:18 but keep alive for yourselves all the young females who have not had sexual relations.
04Nm 31:19 "You are to remain outside the camp for seven days. All of you and your prisoners who have killed a person or touched the dead are to purify yourselves on the third day and the seventh day.
04Nm 31:20 Also purify everything: garments, leather goods, things made of goat hair, and every article of wood."
04Nm 31:21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone to battle, "This is the legal statute the LORD commanded Moses:
04Nm 31:22 Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead--
04Nm 31:23 everything that can withstand fire-- put through fire, and it will be clean. It must still be purified with the purification water. Anything that cannot withstand fire, put through the water.
04Nm 31:24 On the seventh day wash your clothes, and you will be clean. After that you may enter the camp."
04Nm 31:25 The LORD told Moses,
04Nm 31:26 "You, Eleazar the priest, and the family leaders of the community are to take a count of what was captured, human and animal.
04Nm 31:27 Then divide the captives between the troops who went out to war and the entire community.
04Nm 31:28 Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what belongs to the fighting men who went out to war: one out of [every] 500 humans, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats.
04Nm 31:29 Take [the tribute] from their half and give [it] to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
04Nm 31:30 From the Israelites' half, take one out of every 50 from the people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats, all the livestock, and give them to the Levites who perform the duties of the LORD's tabernacle."
04Nm 31:31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:32 The captives remaining from the plunder the army had taken totaled: 675,000 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:33 72,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:34 61,000 donkeys,
04Nm 31:35 and 32,000 people, all the females who had not had sexual relations with a man.
04Nm 31:36 The half portion for those who went out to war numbered: 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:37 and the tribute to the LORD was 675 from the sheep and goats;
04Nm 31:38 from the 36,000 cattle, the tribute to the LORD was 72;
04Nm 31:39 from the 30,500 donkeys, the tribute to the LORD was 61;
04Nm 31:40 and from the 16,000 people, the tribute to the LORD was 32 people.
04Nm 31:41 Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as a contribution for the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:42 From the Israelites' half, which Moses separated from the men who fought,
04Nm 31:43 the community's half was: 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:44 36,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:45 30,500 donkeys,
04Nm 31:46 and 16,000 people.
04Nm 31:47 Moses took one out of [every] 50, selected from the people and the livestock from the Israelites' half. He gave them to the Levites who perform the duties of the LORD's tabernacle, as the LORD had commanded him.
04Nm 31:48 The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, approached Moses
04Nm 31:49 and told him, "Your servants have taken a census of the fighting men under our command, and not one of us is missing.
04Nm 31:50 So we have presented to the LORD an offering of the gold articles each man found-- armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces-- to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
04Nm 31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them all the articles made out of gold.
04Nm 31:52 All the gold of the contribution they offered to the Lord, from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, was 420 pounds.
04Nm 31:53 Each of the soldiers had taken plunder for himself.
04Nm 31:54 Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
04Nm 32:1 The Reubenites and Gadites had a very large number of livestock. When they surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, they saw that the region was a [good] one for livestock.
04Nm 32:2 So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community and said:
04Nm 32:3 "[The territory of] Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
04Nm 32:4 which the LORD struck down before the community of Israel, is [good] land for livestock, and your servants own livestock."
04Nm 32:5 They said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Don't make us cross the Jordan."
04Nm 32:6 But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, "Should your brothers go to war while you stay here?
04Nm 32:7 Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land the LORD has given them?
04Nm 32:8 That's what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
04Nm 32:9 After they went up as far as Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.
04Nm 32:10 So the Lord's anger burned that day, and He swore an oath:
04Nm 32:11 'Because they did not follow Me completely, none of the men 20 years old or more who came up from Egypt will see the land I swore [to give] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob--
04Nm 32:12 none except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they did follow the LORD completely.'
04Nm 32:13 The Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness 40 years until the whole generation that had done what was evil in the LORD's sight was gone.
04Nm 32:14 And here you, a brood of sinners, stand in your fathers' place adding even more to the LORD's burning anger against Israel.
04Nm 32:15 If you turn back from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will destroy all of them."
04Nm 32:16 Then they approached him and said, "We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our dependents.
04Nm 32:17 But we will arm ourselves and be ready [to go] ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our dependents will remain in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
04Nm 32:18 We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has taken possession of his inheritance.
04Nm 32:19 Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance will be across the Jordan to the east."
04Nm 32:20 Moses replied to them, "If you do this-- if you arm yourselves for battle before the Lord,
04Nm 32:21 and every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies from His presence,
04Nm 32:22 and the land is subdued before the LORD-- afterwards you may return and be free from obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD.
04Nm 32:23 But if you don't do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD; be sure your sin will catch up with you.
04Nm 32:24 Build cities for your dependents and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised."
04Nm 32:25 The Gadites and Reubenites answered Moses, "Your servants will do just as my lord commands.
04Nm 32:26 Our little children, wives, livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead,
04Nm 32:27 but your servants are equipped for war before the LORD and will go across to the battle as my lord orders."
04Nm 32:28 So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the family leaders of the Israelite tribes.
04Nm 32:29 Moses told them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, every man in battle formation before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession.
04Nm 32:30 But if they don't go across with you in battle formation, they must accept land in Canaan with you."
04Nm 32:31 The Gadites and Reubenites replied, "What the LORD has spoken to your servants is what we will do.
04Nm 32:32 We will cross over in battle formation before the LORD into the land of Canaan, but we will keep our hereditary possession across the Jordan."
04Nm 32:33 So Moses gave them-- the Gadites, Reubenites, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph-- the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land including its cities with the territories surrounding them.
04Nm 32:34 The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
04Nm 32:35 Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
04Nm 32:36 Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and [built] sheepfolds.
04Nm 32:37 The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
04Nm 32:38 as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
04Nm 32:39 The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04Nm 32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to [the clan of] Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled in it.
04Nm 32:41 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages, which he renamed Jair's Villages.
04Nm 32:42 Nobah went and captured Kenath with its villages and called it Nobah after his own name.
04Nm 33:1 These were the stages of the Israelites' journey when they went out of the land of Egypt by their military divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 33:2 At the LORD's command, Moses wrote down the starting points for the stages of their journey; these are the stages [listed] by their starting points:
04Nm 33:3 They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month. On the day after the Passover the Israelites went out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians.
04Nm 33:4 Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying every firstborn male the LORD had struck down among them, for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods.
04Nm 33:5 The Israelites departed from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
04Nm 33:6 They departed from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
04Nm 33:7 They departed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol.
04Nm 33:8 They departed from Pi-hahiroth and crossed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness. They took a three-day journey into the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
04Nm 33:9 They departed from Marah and came to Elim. There were 12 springs of water and 70 date palms at Elim, so they camped there.
04Nm 33:10 They departed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
04Nm 33:11 They departed from the Red Sea and camped in the Wilderness of Sin.
04Nm 33:12 They departed from the Wilderness of Sin and camped in Dophkah.
04Nm 33:13 They departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
04Nm 33:14 They departed from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
04Nm 33:15 They departed from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 33:16 They departed from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
04Nm 33:17 They departed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
04Nm 33:18 They departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
04Nm 33:19 They departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
04Nm 33:20 They departed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
04Nm 33:21 They departed from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
04Nm 33:22 They departed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
04Nm 33:23 They departed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
04Nm 33:24 They departed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
04Nm 33:25 They departed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
04Nm 33:26 They departed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
04Nm 33:27 They departed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
04Nm 33:28 They departed from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
04Nm 33:29 They departed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
04Nm 33:30 They departed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
04Nm 33:31 They departed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
04Nm 33:32 They departed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
04Nm 33:33 They departed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
04Nm 33:34 They departed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
04Nm 33:35 They departed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
04Nm 33:36 They departed from Ezion-geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin (that is, Kadesh).
04Nm 33:37 They departed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor on the edge of the land of Edom.
04Nm 33:38 At the LORD's command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first [day] of the fifth month in the fortieth year after the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt.
04Nm 33:39 Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
04Nm 33:40 At that time the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard the Israelites were coming.
04Nm 33:41 They departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
04Nm 33:42 They departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
04Nm 33:43 They departed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 33:44 They departed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab.
04Nm 33:45 They departed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
04Nm 33:46 They departed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
04Nm 33:47 They departed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the Abarim [range] facing Nebo.
04Nm 33:48 They departed from the Abarim [range] and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho.
04Nm 33:49 They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth to Acacia Meadows on the plains of Moab.
04Nm 33:50 The LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho,
04Nm 33:51 "Tell the Israelites: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 33:52 you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their stone images and cast images, and demolish all their high places.
04Nm 33:53 You are to take possession of the land and settle in it because I have given you the land to possess.
04Nm 33:54 You are to receive the land as an inheritance by lot according to your clans. Increase the inheritance for a large clan and decrease it for a small one. Whatever place the lot indicates for someone will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to your ancestral tribes.
04Nm 33:55 But if you don't drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become thorns in your eyes and in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you will live.
04Nm 33:56 And what I had planned to do to them, I will do to you."
04Nm 34:1 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 34:2 "Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these borders:
04Nm 34:3 Your southern side will be from the Wilderness of Zin along the boundary of Edom. Your southern border on the east will begin at the east end of the Dead Sea.
04Nm 34:4 Your border will turn south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, proceed to Zin, and end south of Kadesh-barnea. It will go to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon.
04Nm 34:5 The border will turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, where it will end at the Mediterranean Sea.
04Nm 34:6 Your western border will be the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea; this will be your western border.
04Nm 34:7 This will be your northern border: From the Mediterranean Sea draw a line to Mount Hor;
04Nm 34:8 from Mount Hor draw a line to the entrance of Hamath, and the border will reach Zedad.
04Nm 34:9 Then the border will go to Ziphron and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your northern border.
04Nm 34:10 For your eastern border, draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham.
04Nm 34:11 The border will go down from Shepham to Riblah east of Ain. It will continue down and reach the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinnereth.
04Nm 34:12 Then the border will go down to the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea. This will be your land [defined] by its borders on all sides."
04Nm 34:13 So Moses commanded the Israelites, "This is the land you are to receive by lot as an inheritance, which the LORD commanded to be given to the nine and a half tribes.
04Nm 34:14 For the tribe of the Reubenites and the tribe of the Gadites have received [their inheritance] according to their ancestral houses, and half the tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance.
04Nm 34:15 The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise."
04Nm 34:16 The LORD spoke to Moses,
04Nm 34:17 "These are the names of the men who are to distribute the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 34:18 Take one leader from each tribe to distribute the land.
04Nm 34:19 These are the names of the men: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
04Nm 34:20 Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;
04Nm 34:21 Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;
04Nm 34:22 Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;
04Nm 34:23 from the sons of Joseph: Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh,
04Nm 34:24 Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim;
04Nm 34:25 Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;
04Nm 34:26 Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;
04Nm 34:27 Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;
04Nm 34:28 Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali."
04Nm 34:29 These are the ones the LORD commanded to distribute the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
04Nm 35:1 The LORD again spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho:
04Nm 35:2 "Command the Israelites to give cities out of their hereditary property for the Levites to live in and pastureland around the cities.
04Nm 35:3 The cities will be for them to live in, and their pasturelands will be for their herds, flocks, and all their [other] animals.
04Nm 35:4 The pasturelands of the cities you are to give the Levites [will extend] from the city wall 500 yards on every side.
04Nm 35:5 Measure 1,000 yards outside the city for the east side, 1,000 yards for the south side, 1,000 yards for the west side, and 1,000 yards for the north side, with the city in the center. This will belong to them as pasturelands for the cities.
04Nm 35:6 "The cities you give the Levites will include six cities of refuge, which you must provide so that the one who kills someone may flee there; in addition to these, give 42 [other] cities.
04Nm 35:7 The total number of cities you give the Levites will be 48, along with their pasturelands.
04Nm 35:8 Of the cities that you give from the Israelites' territory, you should take more from a larger [tribe] and less from a smaller one. Each [tribe] is to give some of its cities to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance it receives."
04Nm 35:9 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 35:10 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 35:11 designate cities to serve as cities of refuge for you, so that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there.
04Nm 35:12 You will have the cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the one who kills someone will not die until he stands trial before the assembly.
04Nm 35:13 The cities you select will be your six cities of refuge.
04Nm 35:14 Select three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan to be cities of refuge.
04Nm 35:15 These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or temporary resident among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.
04Nm 35:16 "If anyone strikes a person with an iron object and death results, he is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.
04Nm 35:17 If a man has in his hand a stone capable of causing death and strikes another man and he dies, the murderer must be put to death.
04Nm 35:18 If a man has in his hand a wooden object capable of causing death and he dies, the murderer must be put to death.
04Nm 35:19 The avenger of blood himself is to kill the murderer; when he finds him, he is to kill him.
04Nm 35:20 Likewise, if anyone in hatred pushes a person or throws [an object] at him with malicious intent and he dies,
04Nm 35:21 or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood is to kill the murderer when he finds him.
04Nm 35:22 "But if anyone suddenly pushes a person without hostility or throws any object at him without malicious intent
04Nm 35:23 or drops a stone without looking that could kill a person and he dies, but he was not his enemy and wasn't trying to harm him,
04Nm 35:24 the assembly is to judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
04Nm 35:25 The assembly is to protect the one who kills someone from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge he fled to, and he must live there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
04Nm 35:26 "If the one who kills someone ever goes outside the border of the city of refuge he fled to,
04Nm 35:27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge and kills him, the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed,
04Nm 35:28 for the one who killed a person was supposed to live in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may the one who has killed a person return to the land he possesses.
04Nm 35:29 These [instructions] will be a statutory ordinance for you throughout your generations wherever you live.
04Nm 35:30 "If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death based on the word of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of one witness.
04Nm 35:31 You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of killing someone; he must be put to death.
04Nm 35:32 Neither should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to his city of refuge, allowing him to return and live in the land before the death of the [high] priest.
04Nm 35:33 "Do not defile the land where you are, for bloodshed defiles the land, and there can be no atonement for the land because of the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of the person who shed it.
04Nm 35:34 Do not make the land unclean where you live and where I reside; for I, the Lord, reside among the Israelites."
04Nm 36:1 The family leaders from the clan of the descendants of Gilead-- the son of Machir, son of Manasseh-- one of the clans of the sons of Joseph approached and addressed Moses and the leaders who were over the Israelite families.
04Nm 36:2 They said, "The LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites. My lord was further commanded by the LORD to give our brother Zelophehad's inheritance to his daughters.
04Nm 36:3 If they marry any of the men from the [other] Israelite tribes, their inheritance will be taken away from our fathers' inheritance and added to that of the tribe into which they marry. Therefore, part of our allotted inheritance would be taken away.
04Nm 36:4 When the Jubilee comes for the Israelites, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our ancestral tribe."
04Nm 36:5 So Moses commanded the Israelites at the word of the LORD, "What the tribe of Joseph's descendants says is right.
04Nm 36:6 This is what the LORD has commanded concerning Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they like provided they marry within a clan of their ancestral tribe.
04Nm 36:7 An inheritance belonging to the Israelites must not transfer from tribe to tribe, because each of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of his ancestral tribe.
04Nm 36:8 Any daughter who possesses an inheritance from an Israelite tribe must marry someone from the clan of her ancestral tribe, so that each of the Israelites will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
04Nm 36:9 No inheritance is to transfer from one tribe to another, because each of the Israelite tribes is to retain its inheritance."
04Nm 36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 36:11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married cousins on their father's side.
04Nm 36:12 They married [men] from the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father's clan.
04Nm 36:13 These are the commands and ordinances the LORD commanded the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho.
