40Mt 1:1 The historical record of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
40Mt 1:2 Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,
40Mt 1:3 Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram,
40Mt 1:4 Aram fathered Aminadab, Aminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon,
40Mt 1:5 Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,
40Mt 1:6 and Jesse fathered King David. Then David fathered Solomon by Uriah's wife,
40Mt 1:7 Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asa,
40Mt 1:8 Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,
40Mt 1:9 Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
40Mt 1:10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, Amon fathered Josiah,
40Mt 1:11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
40Mt 1:12 Then after the exile to Babylon Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,
40Mt 1:13 Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,
40Mt 1:14 Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,
40Mt 1:15 Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, Matthan fathered Jacob,
40Mt 1:16 and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Messiah.
40Mt 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David were 14 generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon, 14 generations; and from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah, 14 generations.
40Mt 1:18 The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After His mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, it was discovered before they came together that she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:19 So her husband Joseph, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her publicly, decided to divorce her secretly.
40Mt 1:20 But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to name Him Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins."
40Mt 1:22 Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:
40Mt 1:23 See, the virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name Him Immanuel, which is translated "God is with us."
40Mt 1:24 When Joseph got up from sleeping, he did as the Lord's angel had commanded him. He married her
40Mt 1:25 but did not know her intimately until she gave birth to a son. And he named Him Jesus.
40Mt 2:1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived unexpectedly in Jerusalem,
40Mt 2:2 saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him."
40Mt 2:3 When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
40Mt 2:4 So he assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Messiah would be born.
40Mt 2:5 "In Bethlehem of Judea," they told him, "because this is what was written by the prophet:
40Mt 2:6 And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah: because out of you will come a leader who will shepherd My people Israel."
40Mt 2:7 Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them the exact time the star appeared.
40Mt 2:8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find Him, report back to me so that I too can go and worship Him."
40Mt 2:9 After hearing the king, they went on their way. And there it was-- the star they had seen in the east! It led them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was.
40Mt 2:10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed beyond measure.
40Mt 2:11 Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary His mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
40Mt 2:12 And being warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.
40Mt 2:13 After they were gone, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up! Take the child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy Him."
40Mt 2:14 So he got up, took the child and His mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt.
40Mt 2:15 He stayed there until Herod's death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: Out of Egypt I called My Son.
40Mt 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the male children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men.
40Mt 2:17 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
40Mt 2:18 A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be consoled, because they were no more.
40Mt 2:19 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
40Mt 2:20 saying, "Get up! Take the child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, because those who sought the child's life are dead."
40Mt 2:21 So he got up, took the child and His mother, and entered the land of Israel.
40Mt 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
40Mt 2:23 Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that He will be called a Nazarene.
40Mt 3:1 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Wilderness of Judea
40Mt 3:2 and saying, "Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!"
40Mt 3:3 For he is the one spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, who said: A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord; make His paths straight!"
40Mt 3:4 John himself had a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
40Mt 3:5 Then [people from] Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the vicinity of the Jordan were flocking to him,
40Mt 3:6 and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
40Mt 3:7 When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place of his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40Mt 3:8 Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance.
40Mt 3:9 And don't presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!
40Mt 3:10 Even now the ax is ready to strike the root of the trees! Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 3:11 "I baptize you with water for repentance, but the One who is coming after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to take off His sandals. He Himself will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
40Mt 3:12 His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn. But the chaff He will burn up with fire that never goes out."
40Mt 3:13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.
40Mt 3:14 But John tried to stop Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and yet You come to me?"
40Mt 3:15 Jesus answered him, "Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him [to be baptized].
40Mt 3:16 After Jesus was baptized, He went up immediately from the water. The heavens suddenly opened for Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on Him.
40Mt 3:17 And there came a voice from heaven: This is My beloved Son. I take delight in Him!
40Mt 4:1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil.
40Mt 4:2 After He had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, He was hungry.
40Mt 4:3 Then the tempter approached Him and said, "If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
40Mt 4:4 But He answered, "It is written: Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God."
40Mt 4:5 Then the Devil took Him to the holy city, had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,
40Mt 4:6 and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: He will give His angels orders concerning you and, they will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."
40Mt 4:7 Jesus told him, "It is also written: Do not test the Lord your God."
40Mt 4:8 Again, the Devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
40Mt 4:9 And he said to Him, "I will give You all these things if You will fall down and worship me."
40Mt 4:10 Then Jesus told him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written: Worship the Lord your God, and serve only Him."
40Mt 4:11 Then the Devil left Him, and immediately angels came and began to serve Him.
40Mt 4:12 When He heard that John had been arrested, He withdrew into Galilee.
40Mt 4:13 He left Nazareth behind and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
40Mt 4:14 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
40Mt 4:15 Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the sea road, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles!
40Mt 4:16 The people who live in darkness have seen a great light, and for those living in the shadowland of death, light has dawned.
40Mt 4:17 From then on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!"
40Mt 4:18 As He was walking along the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, since they were fishermen.
40Mt 4:19 "Follow Me," He told them, "and I will make you fish for people!"
40Mt 4:20 Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
40Mt 4:21 Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and He called them.
40Mt 4:22 Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.
40Mt 4:23 Jesus was going all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40Mt 4:24 Then the news about Him spread throughout Syria. So they brought to Him all those who were afflicted, those suffering from various diseases and intense pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralytics. And He healed them.
40Mt 4:25 Large crowds followed Him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
40Mt 5:1 When He saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain, and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
40Mt 5:2 Then He began to teach them, saying:
40Mt 5:3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
40Mt 5:4 Blessed are those who mourn, because they will be comforted.
40Mt 5:5 Blessed are the gentle, because they will inherit the earth.
40Mt 5:6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be filled.
40Mt 5:7 Blessed are the merciful, because they will be shown mercy.
40Mt 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God.
40Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God.
40Mt 5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
40Mt 5:11 "Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me.
40Mt 5:12 Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
40Mt 5:13 "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can it be made salty? It's no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trampled on by men.
40Mt 5:14 "You are the light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden.
40Mt 5:15 No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather on a lampstand, and it gives light for all who are in the house.
40Mt 5:16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.
40Mt 5:17 "Don't assume that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
40Mt 5:18 For I assure you: Until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or one stroke of a letter will pass from the law until all things are accomplished.
40Mt 5:19 Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches [these commandments] will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:20 For I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:21 "You have heard that it was said to our ancestors, Do not murder, and whoever murders will be subject to judgment.
40Mt 5:22 But I tell you, everyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Fool!' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You moron!' will be subject to hellfire.
40Mt 5:23 So if you are offering your gift on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
40Mt 5:24 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
40Mt 5:25 Reach a settlement quickly with your adversary while you're on the way with him, or your adversary will hand you over to the judge, the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
40Mt 5:26 I assure you: You will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny!
40Mt 5:27 "You have heard that it was said, Do not commit adultery.
40Mt 5:28 But I tell you, everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40Mt 5:29 If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40Mt 5:30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go into hell!
40Mt 5:31 "It was also said, Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.
40Mt 5:32 But I tell you, everyone who divorces his wife, except in a case of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
40Mt 5:33 "Again, you have heard that it was said to our ancestors, You must not break your oath, but you must keep your oaths to the Lord.
40Mt 5:34 But I tell you, don't take an oath at all: either by heaven, because it is God's throne;
40Mt 5:35 or by the earth, because it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
40Mt 5:36 Neither should you swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black.
40Mt 5:37 But let your word 'yes' be 'yes,' and your 'no' be 'no.' Anything more than this is from the evil one.
40Mt 5:38 "You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
40Mt 5:39 But I tell you, don't resist an evildoer. On the contrary, if anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
40Mt 5:40 As for the one who wants to sue you and take away your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
40Mt 5:41 And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
40Mt 5:42 Give to the one who asks you, and don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
40Mt 5:43 "You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
40Mt 5:44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
40Mt 5:45 so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40Mt 5:46 For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
40Mt 5:47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing out of the ordinary? Don't even the Gentiles do the same?
40Mt 5:48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
40Mt 6:1 "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people, to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
40Mt 6:2 So whenever you give to the poor, don't sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be applauded by people. I assure you: They've got their reward!
40Mt 6:3 But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
40Mt 6:4 so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
40Mt 6:5 "Whenever you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. I assure you: They've got their reward!
40Mt 6:6 But when you pray, go into your private room, shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
40Mt 6:7 When you pray, don't babble like the idolaters, since they imagine they'll be heard for their many words.
40Mt 6:8 Don't be like them, because your Father knows the things you need before you ask Him.
40Mt 6:9 "Therefore, you should pray like this: Our Father in heaven, Your name be honored as holy.
40Mt 6:10 Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
40Mt 6:11 Give us today our daily bread.
40Mt 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40Mt 6:13 And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. [[For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.]]
40Mt 6:14 "For if you forgive people their wrongdoing, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well.
40Mt 6:15 But if you don't forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoing.
40Mt 6:16 "Whenever you fast, don't be sad-faced like the hypocrites. For they make their faces unattractive so their fasting is obvious to people. I assure you: They've got their reward!
40Mt 6:17 But when you fast, put oil on your head, and wash your face,
40Mt 6:18 so that you don't show your fasting to people but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
40Mt 6:19 "Don't collect for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
40Mt 6:20 But collect for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don't break in and steal.
40Mt 6:21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
40Mt 6:22 "The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
40Mt 6:23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light within you is darkness-- how deep is that darkness!
40Mt 6:24 "No one can be a slave of two masters, since either he will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves of God and of money.
40Mt 6:25 "This is why I tell you: Don't worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food and the body more than clothing?
40Mt 6:26 Look at the birds of the sky: they don't sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you worth more than they?
40Mt 6:27 Can any of you add a single cubit to his height by worrying?
40Mt 6:28 And why do you worry about clothes? Learn how the wildflowers of the field grow: they don't labor or spin thread.
40Mt 6:29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these!
40Mt 6:30 If that's how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, won't He do much more for you-- you of little faith?
40Mt 6:31 So don't worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
40Mt 6:32 For the idolaters eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
40Mt 6:33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you.
40Mt 6:34 Therefore don't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
40Mt 7:1 "Do not judge, so that you won't be judged.
40Mt 7:2 For with the judgment you use, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
40Mt 7:3 Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye but don't notice the log in your own eye?
40Mt 7:4 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and look, there's a log in your eye?
40Mt 7:5 Hypocrite! First take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
40Mt 7:6 Don't give what is holy to dogs or toss your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them with their feet, turn, and tear you to pieces.
40Mt 7:7 "Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you.
40Mt 7:8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who searches finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
40Mt 7:9 What man among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
40Mt 7:10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
40Mt 7:11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
40Mt 7:12 Therefore, whatever you want others to do for you, do also the same for them-- this is the Law and the Prophets.
40Mt 7:13 "Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go through it.
40Mt 7:14 How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it.
40Mt 7:15 "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves.
40Mt 7:16 You'll recognize them by their fruit. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
40Mt 7:17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
40Mt 7:18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit; neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.
40Mt 7:19 Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 7:20 So you'll recognize them by their fruit.
40Mt 7:21 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but [only] the one who does the will of My Father in heaven.
40Mt 7:22 On that day many will say to Me, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in Your name, drive out demons in Your name, and do many miracles in Your name?'
40Mt 7:23 Then I will announce to them, 'I never knew you! Depart from Me, you lawbreakers!'
40Mt 7:24 "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on the rock.
40Mt 7:25 The rain fell, the rivers rose, and the winds blew and pounded that house. Yet it didn't collapse, because its foundation was on the rock.
40Mt 7:26 But everyone who hears these words of Mine and doesn't act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
40Mt 7:27 The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house, and it collapsed. And its collapse was great!"
40Mt 7:28 When Jesus had finished this sermon, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,
40Mt 7:29 because He was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.
40Mt 8:1 When He came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.
40Mt 8:2 Right away a man with a serious skin disease came up and knelt before Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
40Mt 8:3 Reaching out His hand He touched him, saying, "I am willing; be made clean." Immediately his disease was healed.
40Mt 8:4 Then Jesus told him, "See that you don't tell anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses prescribed, as a testimony to them."
40Mt 8:5 When He entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him,
40Mt 8:6 "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible agony!"
40Mt 8:7 "I will come and heal him," He told him.
40Mt 8:8 "Lord," the centurion replied, "I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But only say the word, and my servant will be cured.
40Mt 8:9 For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."
40Mt 8:10 Hearing this, Jesus was amazed and said to those following Him, "I assure you: I have not found anyone in Israel with so great a faith!
40Mt 8:11 I tell you that many will come from east and west, and recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 8:12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 8:13 Then Jesus told the centurion, "Go. As you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was cured that very moment.
40Mt 8:14 When Jesus went into Peter's house, He saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
40Mt 8:15 So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve Him.
40Mt 8:16 When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick,
40Mt 8:17 so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: He Himself took our weaknesses and carried our diseases.
40Mt 8:18 When Jesus saw large crowds around Him, He gave the order to go to the other side [of the sea].
40Mt 8:19 A scribe approached Him and said, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go!"
40Mt 8:20 Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head."
40Mt 8:21 "Lord," another of His disciples said, "first let me go bury my father."
40Mt 8:22 But Jesus told him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
40Mt 8:23 As He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
40Mt 8:24 Suddenly, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves. But He was sleeping.
40Mt 8:25 So the disciples came and woke Him up, saying, "Lord, save [us]! We're going to die!"
40Mt 8:26 But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, you of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea. And there was a great calm.
40Mt 8:27 The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this?-- even the winds and the sea obey Him!"
40Mt 8:28 When He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him as they came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
40Mt 8:29 Suddenly they shouted, "What do You have to do with us, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
40Mt 8:30 Now a long way off from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
40Mt 8:31 "If You drive us out," the demons begged Him, "send us into the herd of pigs."
40Mt 8:32 "Go!" He told them. So when they had come out, they entered the pigs. And suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water.
40Mt 8:33 Then the men who tended them fled. They went into the city and reported everything-- especially what had happened to those who were demon-possessed.
40Mt 8:34 At that, the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
40Mt 9:1 So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own town.
40Mt 9:2 Just then some men brought to Him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. Seeing their faith, Jesus told the paralytic, "Have courage, son, your sins are forgiven."
40Mt 9:3 At this, some of the scribes said among themselves, "He's blaspheming!"
40Mt 9:4 But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
40Mt 9:5 For which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
40Mt 9:6 But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-- then He told the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home."
40Mt 9:7 And he got up and went home.
40Mt 9:8 When the crowds saw this, they were awestruck and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men.
40Mt 9:9 As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me!" So he got up and followed Him.
40Mt 9:10 While He was reclining at the table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came as guests to eat with Jesus and His disciples.
40Mt 9:11 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
40Mt 9:12 But when He heard this, He said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but the sick do.
40Mt 9:13 Go and learn what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners."
40Mt 9:14 Then John's disciples came to Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
40Mt 9:15 Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests be sad while the groom is with them? The days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
40Mt 9:16 No one patches an old garment with unshrunk cloth, because the patch pulls away from the garment and makes the tear worse.
40Mt 9:17 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the skins burst, the wine spills out, and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
40Mt 9:18 As He was telling them these things, suddenly one of the leaders came and knelt down before Him, saying, "My daughter is near death, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
40Mt 9:19 So Jesus and His disciples got up and followed him.
40Mt 9:20 Just then, a woman who had suffered from bleeding for 12 years approached from behind and touched the tassel on His robe,
40Mt 9:21 for she said to herself, "If I can just touch His robe, I'll be made well!"
40Mt 9:22 But Jesus turned and saw her. "Have courage, daughter," He said. "Your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well from that moment.
40Mt 9:23 When Jesus came to the leader's house, He saw the flute players and a crowd lamenting loudly.
40Mt 9:24 "Leave," He said, "because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping." And they started laughing at Him.
40Mt 9:25 But when the crowd had been put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
40Mt 9:26 And this news spread throughout that whole area.
40Mt 9:27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40Mt 9:28 When He entered the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered Him.
40Mt 9:29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "Let it be done for you according to your faith!"
40Mt 9:30 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus warned them sternly, "Be sure that no one finds out!"
40Mt 9:31 But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout that whole area.
40Mt 9:32 Just as they were going out, a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak was brought to Him.
40Mt 9:33 When the demon had been driven out, the man spoke. And the crowds were amazed, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
40Mt 9:34 But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons!"
40Mt 9:35 Then Jesus went to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
40Mt 9:36 When He saw the crowds, He felt compassion for them, because they were weary and worn out, like sheep without a shepherd.
40Mt 9:37 Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few.
40Mt 9:38 Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
40Mt 10:1 Summoning His 12 disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out and to heal every disease and sickness.
40Mt 10:2 These are the names of the 12 apostles: First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
40Mt 10:3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40Mt 10:4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
40Mt 10:5 Jesus sent out these 12 after giving them instructions: "Don't take the road leading to other nations, and don't enter any Samaritan town.
40Mt 10:6 Instead, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
40Mt 10:7 As you go, announce this: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'
40Mt 10:8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with skin diseases, drive out demons. You have received free of charge; give free of charge.
40Mt 10:9 Don't take along gold, silver, or copper for your money-belts.
40Mt 10:10 Don't take a traveling bag for the road, or an extra shirt, sandals, or a walking stick, for the worker is worthy of his food.
40Mt 10:11 "When you enter any town or village, find out who is worthy, and stay there until you leave.
40Mt 10:12 Greet a household when you enter it,
40Mt 10:13 and if the household is worthy, let your peace be on it. But if it is unworthy, let your peace return to you.
40Mt 10:14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
40Mt 10:15 I assure you: It will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
40Mt 10:16 "Look, I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as serpents and as harmless as doves.
40Mt 10:17 Because people will hand you over to sanhedrins and flog you in their synagogues, beware of them.
40Mt 10:18 You will even be brought before governors and kings because of Me, to bear witness to them and to the nations.
40Mt 10:19 But when they hand you over, don't worry about how or what you should speak. For you will be given what to say at that hour,
40Mt 10:20 because you are not speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is speaking through you.
40Mt 10:21 "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will even rise up against their parents and have them put to death.
40Mt 10:22 You will be hated by everyone because of My name. But the one who endures to the end will be delivered.
40Mt 10:23 When they persecute you in one town, escape to another. For I assure you: You will not have covered the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
40Mt 10:24 A disciple is not above his teacher, or a slave above his master.
40Mt 10:25 It is enough for a disciple to become like his teacher and a slave like his master. If they called the head of the house ' Beelzebul,' how much more the members of his household!
40Mt 10:26 "Therefore, don't be afraid of them, since there is nothing covered that won't be uncovered, and nothing hidden that won't be made known.
40Mt 10:27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What you hear in a whisper, proclaim on the housetops.
40Mt 10:28 Don't fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather, fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
40Mt 10:29 Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's consent.
40Mt 10:30 But even the hairs of your head have all been counted.
40Mt 10:31 Don't be afraid therefore; you are worth more than many sparrows.
40Mt 10:32 "Therefore, everyone who will acknowledge Me before men, I will also acknowledge him before My Father in heaven.
40Mt 10:33 But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.
40Mt 10:34 Don't assume that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40Mt 10:35 For I came to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
40Mt 10:36 and a man's enemies will be the members of his household.
40Mt 10:37 The person who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; the person who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
40Mt 10:38 And whoever doesn't take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.
40Mt 10:39 Anyone finding his life will lose it, and anyone losing his life because of Me will find it.
40Mt 10:40 "The one who welcomes you welcomes Me, and the one who welcomes Me welcomes Him who sent Me.
40Mt 10:41 Anyone who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And anyone who welcomes a righteous person because he's righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.
40Mt 10:42 And whoever gives just a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple-- I assure you: He will never lose his reward!"
40Mt 11:1 When Jesus had finished giving orders to His 12 disciples, He moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns.
40Mt 11:2 When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent [a message] by his disciples
40Mt 11:3 and asked Him, "Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"
40Mt 11:4 Jesus replied to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see:
40Mt 11:5 the blind see, the lame walk, those with skin diseases are healed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are told the good news.
40Mt 11:6 And if anyone is not offended because of Me, he is blessed."
40Mt 11:7 As these men went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
40Mt 11:8 What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Look, those who wear soft clothes are in kings' palaces.
40Mt 11:9 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.
40Mt 11:10 This is the one it is written about: Look, I am sending My messenger ahead of You; he will prepare Your way before You.
40Mt 11:11 "I assure you: Among those born of women no one greater than John the Baptist has appeared, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40Mt 11:12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence, and the violent have been seizing it by force.
40Mt 11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John;
40Mt 11:14 if you're willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.
40Mt 11:15 Anyone who has ears should listen!
40Mt 11:16 "To what should I compare this generation? It's like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to each other:
40Mt 11:17 We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance; we sang a lament, but you didn't mourn!
40Mt 11:18 For John did not come eating or drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'
40Mt 11:19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds."
40Mt 11:20 Then He proceeded to denounce the towns where most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent:
40Mt 11:21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes long ago!
40Mt 11:22 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
40Mt 11:23 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
40Mt 11:24 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
40Mt 11:25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to infants.
40Mt 11:26 Yes, Father, because this was Your good pleasure.
40Mt 11:27 All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal Him.
40Mt 11:28 "Come to Me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
40Mt 11:29 All of you, take up My yoke and learn from Me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for yourselves.
40Mt 11:30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."
40Mt 12:1 At that time Jesus passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick and eat some heads of grain.
40Mt 12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
40Mt 12:3 He said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry--
40Mt 12:4 how he entered the house of God, and they ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?
40Mt 12:5 Or haven't you read in the Law that on Sabbath days the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and are innocent?
40Mt 12:6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here!
40Mt 12:7 If you had known what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the innocent.
40Mt 12:8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:9 Moving on from there, He entered their synagogue.
40Mt 12:10 There He saw a man who had a paralyzed hand. And in order to accuse Him they asked Him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
40Mt 12:11 But He said to them, "What man among you, if he had a sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, wouldn't take hold of it and lift it out?
40Mt 12:12 A man is worth far more than a sheep, so it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:13 Then He told the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, as good as the other.
40Mt 12:14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him.
40Mt 12:15 When Jesus became aware of this, He withdrew from there. Huge crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
40Mt 12:16 He warned them not to make Him known,
40Mt 12:17 so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
40Mt 12:18 Here is My Servant whom I have chosen, My beloved in whom My soul delights; I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will proclaim justice to the nations.
40Mt 12:19 He will not argue or shout, and no one will hear His voice in the streets.
40Mt 12:20 He will not break a bruised reed, and He will not put out a smoldering wick, until He has led justice to victory.
40Mt 12:21 The nations will put their hope in His name.
40Mt 12:22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to speak was brought to Him. He healed him, so that the man could both speak and see.
40Mt 12:23 And all the crowds were astounded and said, "Perhaps this is the Son of David!"
40Mt 12:24 When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "The man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
40Mt 12:25 Knowing their thoughts, He told them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is headed for destruction, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.
40Mt 12:26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
40Mt 12:27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, who is it your sons drive them out by? For this reason they will be your judges.
40Mt 12:28 If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
40Mt 12:29 How can someone enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.
40Mt 12:30 Anyone who is not with Me is against Me, and anyone who does not gather with Me scatters.
40Mt 12:31 Because of this, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40Mt 12:32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the one to come.
40Mt 12:33 "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
40Mt 12:34 Brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.
40Mt 12:35 A good man produces good things from his storeroom of good, and an evil man produces evil things from his storeroom of evil.
40Mt 12:36 I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak.
40Mt 12:37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."
40Mt 12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
40Mt 12:39 But He answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation demands a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40Mt 12:40 For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
40Mt 12:41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at Jonah's proclamation; and look-- something greater than Jonah is here!
40Mt 12:42 The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look-- something greater than Solomon is here!
40Mt 12:43 "When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it roams through waterless places looking for rest but doesn't find any.
40Mt 12:44 Then it says, 'I'll go back to my house that I came from.' And when it arrives, it finds [the house] vacant, swept, and put in order.
40Mt 12:45 Then off it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and settle down there. As a result, that man's last condition is worse than the first. That's how it will also be with this evil generation."
40Mt 12:46 He was still speaking to the crowds when suddenly His mother and brothers were standing outside wanting to speak to Him.
40Mt 12:47 Someone told Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to You."
40Mt 12:48 But He replied to the one who told Him, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?"
40Mt 12:49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers!
40Mt 12:50 For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, that person is My brother and sister and mother."
40Mt 13:1 On that day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.
40Mt 13:2 Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat down, while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
40Mt 13:3 Then He told them many things in parables, saying: "Consider the sower who went out to sow.
40Mt 13:4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and ate them up.
40Mt 13:5 Others fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil, and they sprang up quickly since the soil wasn't deep.
40Mt 13:6 But when the sun came up they were scorched, and since they had no root, they withered.
40Mt 13:7 Others fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
40Mt 13:8 Still others fell on good ground, and produced a crop: some 100, some 60, and some 30 times [what was sown].
40Mt 13:9 Anyone who has ears should listen!"
40Mt 13:10 Then the disciples came up and asked Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
40Mt 13:11 He answered them, "Because the secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been given for you to know, but it has not been given to them.
40Mt 13:12 For whoever has, [more] will be given to him, and he will have more than enough. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
40Mt 13:13 For this reason I speak to them in parables, because looking they do not see, and hearing they do not listen or understand.
40Mt 13:14 Isaiah's prophecy is fulfilled in them, which says: You will listen and listen, yet never understand; and you will look and look, yet never perceive.
40Mt 13:15 For this people's heart has grown callous; their ears are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn back-- and I would cure them.
40Mt 13:16 "But your eyes are blessed because they do see, and your ears because they do hear!
40Mt 13:17 For I assure you: Many prophets and righteous people longed to see the things you see yet didn't see them; to hear the things you hear yet didn't hear them.
40Mt 13:18 "You, then, listen to the parable of the sower:
40Mt 13:19 When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the one sown along the path.
40Mt 13:20 And the one sown on rocky ground-- this is one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
40Mt 13:21 Yet he has no root in himself, but is short-lived. When pressure or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
40Mt 13:22 Now the one sown among the thorns-- this is one who hears the word, but the worries of this age and the seduction of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
40Mt 13:23 But the one sown on the good ground-- this is one who hears and understands the word, who does bear fruit and yields: some 100, some 60, some 30 times [what was sown]."
40Mt 13:24 He presented another parable to them: "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40Mt 13:25 But while people were sleeping, his enemy came, sowed weeds among the wheat, and left.
40Mt 13:26 When the plants sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.
40Mt 13:27 The landowner's slaves came to him and said, 'Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?'
40Mt 13:28 " 'An enemy did this!' he told them. " 'So, do you want us to go and gather them up?' the slaves asked him.
40Mt 13:29 " 'No,' he said. 'When you gather up the weeds, you might also uproot the wheat with them.
40Mt 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time I'll tell the reapers: Gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles to burn them, but store the wheat in my barn. '"
40Mt 13:31 He presented another parable to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
40Mt 13:32 It's the smallest of all the seeds, but when grown, it's taller than the vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches."
40Mt 13:33 He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into 50 pounds of flour until it spread through all of it."
40Mt 13:34 Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables, and He would not speak anything to them without a parable,
40Mt 13:35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled: I will open My mouth in parables; I will declare things kept secret from the foundation of the world.
40Mt 13:36 Then He dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples approached Him and said, "Explain the parable of the weeds in the field to us."
40Mt 13:37 He replied: "The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;
40Mt 13:38 the field is the world; and the good seed-- these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, and
40Mt 13:39 the enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
40Mt 13:40 Therefore just as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
40Mt 13:41 The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather from His kingdom everything that causes sin and those guilty of lawlessness.
40Mt 13:42 They will throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Anyone who has ears should listen!
40Mt 13:44 "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure, buried in a field, that a man found and reburied. Then in his joy he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.
40Mt 13:45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
40Mt 13:46 When he found one priceless pearl, he went and sold everything he had, and bought it.
40Mt 13:47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a large net thrown into the sea. It collected every kind [of fish],
40Mt 13:48 and when it was full, they dragged it ashore, sat down, and gathered the good [fish] into containers, but threw out the worthless ones.
40Mt 13:49 So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out, separate the evil people from the righteous,
40Mt 13:50 and throw them into the blazing furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:51 "Have you understood all these things?" "Yes," they told Him.
40Mt 13:52 "Therefore," He said to them, "every student of Scripture instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who brings out of his storeroom what is new and what is old."
40Mt 13:53 When Jesus had finished these parables, He left there.
40Mt 13:54 He went to His hometown and began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "How did this wisdom and these miracles come to Him?
40Mt 13:55 Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't His mother called Mary, and His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
40Mt 13:56 And His sisters, aren't they all with us? So where does He get all these things?"
40Mt 13:57 And they were offended by Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his household."
40Mt 13:58 And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
40Mt 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus.
40Mt 14:2 "This is John the Baptist!" he told his servants. "He has been raised from the dead, and that's why supernatural powers are at work in him."
40Mt 14:3 For Herod had arrested John, chained him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
40Mt 14:4 since John had been telling him, "It's not lawful for you to have her!"
40Mt 14:5 Though he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, since they regarded him as a prophet.
40Mt 14:6 But when Herod's birthday celebration came, Herodias' daughter danced before them and pleased Herod.
40Mt 14:7 So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
40Mt 14:8 And prompted by her mother, she answered, "Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter!"
40Mt 14:9 Although the king regretted it, he commanded that it be granted because of his oaths and his guests.
40Mt 14:10 So he sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison.
40Mt 14:11 His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.
40Mt 14:12 Then his disciples came, removed the corpse, buried it, and went and reported to Jesus.
40Mt 14:13 When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by boat to a remote place to be alone. When the crowds heard this, they followed Him on foot from the towns.
40Mt 14:14 As He stepped ashore, He saw a huge crowd, felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.
40Mt 14:15 When evening came, the disciples approached Him and said, "This place is a wilderness, and it is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
40Mt 14:16 "They don't need to go away," Jesus told them. "You give them something to eat."
40Mt 14:17 "But we only have five loaves and two fish here," they said to Him.
40Mt 14:18 "Bring them here to Me," He said.
40Mt 14:19 Then He commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.
40Mt 14:20 Everyone ate and was filled. Then they picked up 12 baskets full of leftover pieces!
40Mt 14:21 Now those who ate were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.
40Mt 14:22 Immediately He made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.
40Mt 14:23 After dismissing the crowds, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.
40Mt 14:24 But the boat was already over a mile from land, battered by the waves, because the wind was against them.
40Mt 14:25 Around three in the morning, He came toward them walking on the sea.
40Mt 14:26 When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
40Mt 14:27 Immediately Jesus spoke to them. "Have courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
40Mt 14:28 "Lord, if it's You," Peter answered Him, "command me to come to You on the water."
40Mt 14:29 "Come!" He said. And climbing out of the boat, Peter started walking on the water and came toward Jesus.
40Mt 14:30 But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
40Mt 14:31 Immediately Jesus reached out His hand, caught hold of him, and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
40Mt 14:32 When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
40Mt 14:33 Then those in the boat worshiped Him and said, "Truly You are the Son of God!"
40Mt 14:34 Once they crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
40Mt 14:35 When the men of that place recognized Him, they alerted the whole vicinity and brought to Him all who were sick.
40Mt 14:36 They were begging Him that they might only touch the tassel on His robe. And as many as touched it were made perfectly well.
40Mt 15:1 Then Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus and asked,
40Mt 15:2 "Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat!"
40Mt 15:3 He answered them, "And why do you break God's commandment because of your tradition?
40Mt 15:4 For God said: Honor your father and your mother; and, The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.
40Mt 15:5 But you say, 'Whoever tells his father or mother, "Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift [committed to the temple]"--
40Mt 15:6 he does not have to honor his father.' In this way, you have revoked God's word because of your tradition.
40Mt 15:7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:
40Mt 15:8 These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
40Mt 15:9 They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men."
40Mt 15:10 Summoning the crowd, He told them, "Listen and understand:
40Mt 15:11 It's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
40Mt 15:12 Then the disciples came up and told Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard this statement?"
40Mt 15:13 He replied, "Every plant that My heavenly Father didn't plant will be uprooted.
40Mt 15:14 Leave them alone! They are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
40Mt 15:15 Then Peter replied to Him, "Explain this parable to us."
40Mt 15:16 "Are even you still lacking in understanding?" He asked.
40Mt 15:17 "Don't you realize that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is eliminated?
40Mt 15:18 But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and this defiles a man.
40Mt 15:19 For from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
40Mt 15:20 These are the things that defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
40Mt 15:21 When Jesus left there, He withdrew to the area of Tyre and Sidon.
40Mt 15:22 Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came and kept crying out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is cruelly tormented by a demon."
40Mt 15:23 Yet He did not say a word to her. So His disciples approached Him and urged Him, "Send her away because she cries out after us."
40Mt 15:24 He replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40Mt 15:25 But she came, knelt before Him, and said, "Lord, help me!"
40Mt 15:26 He answered, "It isn't right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
40Mt 15:27 "Yes, Lord," she said, "yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table!"
40Mt 15:28 Then Jesus replied to her, "Woman, your faith is great. Let it be done for you as you want." And from that moment her daughter was cured.
40Mt 15:29 Moving on from there, Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a mountain and sat there,
40Mt 15:30 and large crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deformed, those unable to speak, and many others. They put them at His feet, and He healed them.
40Mt 15:31 So the crowd was amazed when they saw those unable to speak talking, the deformed restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they gave glory to the God of Israel.
40Mt 15:32 Now Jesus summoned His disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they've already stayed with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry; otherwise they might collapse on the way."
40Mt 15:33 The disciples said to Him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to fill such a crowd?"
40Mt 15:34 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked them. "Seven," they said, "and a few small fish."
40Mt 15:35 After commanding the crowd to sit down on the ground,
40Mt 15:36 He took the seven loaves and the fish, and He gave thanks, broke them, and kept on giving them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.
40Mt 15:37 They all ate and were filled. Then they collected the leftover pieces-- seven large baskets full.
40Mt 15:38 Now those who ate were 4,000 men, besides women and children.
40Mt 15:39 After dismissing the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
40Mt 16:1 The Pharisees and Sadducees approached, and as a test, asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
40Mt 16:2 He answered them: "When evening comes you say, 'It will be good weather because the sky is red.'
40Mt 16:3 And in the morning, 'Today will be stormy because the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to read the appearance of the sky, but you can't read the signs of the times.
40Mt 16:4 An evil and adulterous generation wants a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then He left them and went away.
40Mt 16:5 The disciples reached the other shore, and they had forgotten to take bread.
40Mt 16:6 Then Jesus told them, "Watch out and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40Mt 16:7 And they discussed among themselves, "We didn't bring any bread."
40Mt 16:8 Aware of this, Jesus said, "You of little faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves that you do not have bread?
40Mt 16:9 Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected?
40Mt 16:10 Or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many large baskets you collected?
40Mt 16:11 Why is it you don't understand that when I told you, 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' it wasn't about bread?"
40Mt 16:12 Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the yeast in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40Mt 16:13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
40Mt 16:14 And they said, "Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
40Mt 16:15 "But you," He asked them, "who do you say that I am?"
40Mt 16:16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!"
40Mt 16:17 And Jesus responded, "Simon son of Jonah, you are blessed because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father in heaven.
40Mt 16:18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the forces of Hades will not overpower it.
40Mt 16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth is already bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth is already loosed in heaven."
40Mt 16:20 And He gave the disciples orders to tell no one that He was the Messiah.
40Mt 16:21 From then on Jesus began to point out to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised the third day.
40Mt 16:22 Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, "Oh no, Lord! This will never happen to You!"
40Mt 16:23 But He turned and told Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me because you're not thinking about God's concerns, but man's."
40Mt 16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to come with Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.
40Mt 16:25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of Me will find it.
40Mt 16:26 What will it benefit a man if he gains the whole world yet loses his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
40Mt 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come with His angels in the glory of His Father, and then He will reward each according to what he has done.
40Mt 16:28 I assure you: There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
40Mt 17:1 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
40Mt 17:2 He was transformed in front of them, and His face shone like the sun. Even His clothes became as white as the light.
40Mt 17:3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
40Mt 17:4 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it's good for us to be here! If You want, I will make three tabernacles here: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40Mt 17:5 While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said: This is My beloved Son. I take delight in Him. Listen to Him!
40Mt 17:6 When the disciples heard it, they fell facedown and were terrified.
40Mt 17:7 Then Jesus came up, touched them, and said, "Get up; don't be afraid."
40Mt 17:8 When they looked up they saw no one except Him-- Jesus alone.
40Mt 17:9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Don't tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
40Mt 17:10 So the disciples questioned Him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
40Mt 17:11 "Elijah is coming and will restore everything," He replied.
40Mt 17:12 "But I tell you: Elijah has already come, and they didn't recognize him. On the contrary, they did whatever they pleased to him. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."
40Mt 17:13 Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.
40Mt 17:14 When they reached the crowd, a man approached and knelt down before Him.
40Mt 17:15 "Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely. He often falls into the fire and often into the water.
40Mt 17:16 I brought him to Your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."
40Mt 17:17 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and rebellious generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to Me."
40Mt 17:18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and from that moment the boy was healed.
40Mt 17:19 Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
40Mt 17:20 "Because of your little faith," He told them. "For I assure you: If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.
40Mt 17:21 [[However, this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.]]"
40Mt 17:22 As they were meeting in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.
40Mt 17:23 They will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised up." And they were deeply distressed.
40Mt 17:24 When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the double-drachma tax approached Peter and said, "Doesn't your Teacher pay the double-drachma tax?"
40Mt 17:25 "Yes," he said. When he went into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, "What do you think, Simon? Who do earthly kings collect tariffs or taxes from? From their sons or from strangers?"
40Mt 17:26 "From strangers," he said. "Then the sons are free," Jesus told him.
40Mt 17:27 "But, so we won't offend them, go to the sea, cast in a fishhook, and catch the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth you'll find a coin. Take it and give it to them for Me and you."
40Mt 18:1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40Mt 18:2 Then He called a child to Him and had him stand among them.
40Mt 18:3 "I assure you," He said, "unless you are converted and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 18:4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child-- this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 18:5 And whoever welcomes one child like this in My name welcomes Me.
40Mt 18:6 "But whoever causes the downfall of one of these little ones who believe in Me-- it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea!
40Mt 18:7 Woe to the world because of offenses. For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes.
40Mt 18:8 If your hand or your foot causes your downfall, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
40Mt 18:9 And if your eye causes your downfall, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, rather than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire!
40Mt 18:10 "See that you don't look down on one of these little ones, because I tell you that in heaven their angels continually view the face of My Father in heaven.
40Mt 18:11 [[For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.]]
40Mt 18:12 What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep, and one of them goes astray, won't he leave the 99 on the hillside and go and search for the stray?
40Mt 18:13 And if he finds it, I assure you: He rejoices over that sheep more than over the 99 that did not go astray.
40Mt 18:14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones perish.
40Mt 18:15 "If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
40Mt 18:16 But if he won't listen, take one or two more with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established.
40Mt 18:17 If he pays no attention to them, tell the church. But if he doesn't pay attention even to the church, let him be like an unbeliever and a tax collector to you.
40Mt 18:18 I assure you: Whatever you bind on earth is already bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth is already loosed in heaven.
40Mt 18:19 Again, I assure you: If two of you on earth agree about any matter that you pray for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven.
40Mt 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there among them."
40Mt 18:21 Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how many times could my brother sin against me and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"
40Mt 18:22 "I tell you, not as many as seven," Jesus said to him, "but 70 times seven.
40Mt 18:23 For this reason, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
40Mt 18:24 When he began to settle accounts, one who owed 10,000 talents was brought before him.
40Mt 18:25 Since he had no way to pay it back, his master commanded that he, his wife, his children, and everything he had be sold to pay the debt.
40Mt 18:26 "At this, the slave fell facedown before him and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you everything!'
40Mt 18:27 Then the master of that slave had compassion, released him, and forgave him the loan.
40Mt 18:28 "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him 100 denarii. He grabbed him, started choking him, and said, 'Pay what you owe!'
40Mt 18:29 "At this, his fellow slave fell down and began begging him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'
40Mt 18:30 But he wasn't willing. On the contrary, he went and threw him into prison until he could pay what was owed.
40Mt 18:31 When the other slaves saw what had taken place, they were deeply distressed and went and reported to their master everything that had happened.
40Mt 18:32 "Then, after he had summoned him, his master said to him, 'You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
40Mt 18:33 Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?'
40Mt 18:34 And his master got angry and handed him over to the jailers until he could pay everything that was owed.
40Mt 18:35 So My heavenly Father will also do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from his heart."
40Mt 19:1 When Jesus had finished this instruction, He departed from Galilee and went to the region of Judea across the Jordan.
40Mt 19:2 Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
40Mt 19:3 Some Pharisees approached Him to test Him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on any grounds?"
40Mt 19:4 "Haven't you read," He replied, "that He who created them in the beginning made them male and female,
40Mt 19:5 and He also said: For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh?
40Mt 19:6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate."
40Mt 19:7 "Why then," they asked Him, "did Moses command [us] to give divorce papers and to send her away?"
40Mt 19:8 He told them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts. But it was not like that from the beginning.
40Mt 19:9 And I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
40Mt 19:10 His disciples said to Him, "If the relationship of a man with his wife is like this, it's better not to marry!"
40Mt 19:11 But He told them, "Not everyone can accept this saying, but only those it has been given to.
40Mt 19:12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, there are eunuchs who were made by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves that way because of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."
40Mt 19:13 Then children were brought to Him so He might put His hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked them.
40Mt 19:14 Then Jesus said, "Leave the children alone, and don't try to keep them from coming to Me, because the kingdom of heaven is made up of people like this."
40Mt 19:15 After putting His hands on them, He went on from there.
40Mt 19:16 Just then someone came up and asked Him, "Teacher, what good must I do to have eternal life?"
40Mt 19:17 "Why do you ask Me about what is good?" He said to him. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
40Mt 19:18 "Which ones?" he asked Him. Jesus answered, Do not murder; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness;
40Mt 19:19 honor your father and your mother; and love your neighbor as yourself.
40Mt 19:20 "I have kept all these," the young man told Him. "What do I still lack?"
40Mt 19:21 "If you want to be perfect," Jesus said to him, "go, sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me."
40Mt 19:22 When the young man heard that command, he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.
40Mt 19:23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "I assure you: It will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!
40Mt 19:24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
40Mt 19:25 When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
40Mt 19:26 But Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40Mt 19:27 Then Peter responded to Him, "Look, we have left everything and followed You. So what will there be for us?"
40Mt 19:28 Jesus said to them, "I assure you: In the Messianic Age, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.
40Mt 19:29 And everyone who has left houses, brothers or sisters, father or mother, children, or fields because of My name will receive 100 times more and will inherit eternal life.
40Mt 19:30 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
40Mt 20:1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40Mt 20:2 After agreeing with the workers on one denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
40Mt 20:3 When he went out about nine in the morning, he saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
40Mt 20:4 To those men he said, 'You also go to my vineyard, and I'll give you whatever is right.' So off they went.
40Mt 20:5 About noon and at three, he went out again and did the same thing.
40Mt 20:6 Then about five he went and found others standing around, and said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?'
40Mt 20:7 " 'Because no one hired us,' they said to him. " 'You also go to my vineyard,' he told them.
40Mt 20:8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard told his foreman, 'Call the workers and give them their pay, starting with the last and ending with the first.'
40Mt 20:9 "When those who were hired about five came, they each received one denarius.
40Mt 20:10 So when the first ones came, they assumed they would get more, but they also received a denarius each.
40Mt 20:11 When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner:
40Mt 20:12 'These last men put in one hour, and you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!'
40Mt 20:13 "He replied to one of them, 'Friend, I'm doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me on a denarius?
40Mt 20:14 Take what's yours and go. I want to give this last man the same as I gave you.
40Mt 20:15 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my business? Are you jealous because I'm generous?'
40Mt 20:16 "So the last will be first, and the first last."
40Mt 20:17 While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the way:
40Mt 20:18 "Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
40Mt 20:19 Then they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified, and He will be resurrected on the third day."
40Mt 20:20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons approached Him with her sons. She knelt down to ask Him for something.
40Mt 20:21 "What do you want?" He asked her. "Promise," she said to Him, "that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom."
40Mt 20:22 But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you're asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" "We are able," they said to Him.
40Mt 20:23 He told them, "You will indeed drink My cup. But to sit at My right and left is not Mine to give; instead, it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."
40Mt 20:24 When the 10 [disciples] heard this, they became indignant with the two brothers.
40Mt 20:25 But Jesus called them over and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and the men of high position exercise power over them.
40Mt 20:26 It must not be like that among you. On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
40Mt 20:27 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave;
40Mt 20:28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life-- a ransom for many."
40Mt 20:29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
40Mt 20:30 There were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40Mt 20:31 The crowd told them to keep quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40Mt 20:32 Jesus stopped, called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
40Mt 20:33 "Lord," they said to Him, "open our eyes!"
40Mt 20:34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed Him.
40Mt 21:1 When they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, Jesus then sent two disciples,
40Mt 21:2 telling them, "Go into the village ahead of you. At once you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to Me.
40Mt 21:3 If anyone says anything to you, you should say that the Lord needs them, and immediately he will send them."
40Mt 21:4 This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled:
40Mt 21:5 Tell Daughter Zion, "See, your King is coming to you, gentle, and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden."
40Mt 21:6 The disciples went and did just as Jesus directed them.
40Mt 21:7 They brought the donkey and the colt; then they laid their robes on them, and He sat on them.
40Mt 21:8 A very large crowd spread their robes on the road; others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
40Mt 21:9 Then the crowds who went ahead of Him and those who followed kept shouting: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!
40Mt 21:10 When He entered Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken, saying, "Who is this?"
40Mt 21:11 And the crowds kept saying, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee!"
40Mt 21:12 Jesus went into the temple complex and drove out all those buying and selling in the temple. He overturned the money changers' tables and the chairs of those selling doves.
40Mt 21:13 And He said to them, "It is written, My house will be called a house of prayer. But you are making it a den of thieves!"
40Mt 21:14 The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple complex, and He healed them.
40Mt 21:15 When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children in the temple complex cheering, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant
40Mt 21:16 and said to Him, "Do You hear what these [children] are saying?" "Yes," Jesus told them. "Have you never read: You have prepared praise from the mouths of children and nursing infants?"
40Mt 21:17 Then He left them, went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.
40Mt 21:18 Early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He was hungry.
40Mt 21:19 Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He went up to it and found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, "May no fruit ever come from you again!" At once the fig tree withered.
40Mt 21:20 When the disciples saw it, they were amazed and said, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
40Mt 21:21 Jesus answered them, "I assure you: If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you tell this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will be done.
40Mt 21:22 And if you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."
40Mt 21:23 When He entered the temple complex, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? Who gave You this authority?"
40Mt 21:24 Jesus answered them, "I will also ask you one question, and if you answer it for Me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
40Mt 21:25 Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They began to argue among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
40Mt 21:26 But if we say, 'From men,' we're afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought John was a prophet."
40Mt 21:27 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." And He said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
40Mt 21:28 "But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'My son, go, work in the vineyard today.'
40Mt 21:29 "He answered, 'I don't want to!' Yet later he changed his mind and went.
40Mt 21:30 Then the man went to the other and said the same thing. " 'I will, sir,' he answered. But he didn't go.
40Mt 21:31 "Which of the two did his father's will?" "The first," they said. Jesus said to them, "I assure you: Tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you!
40Mt 21:32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe him. Tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him, but you, when you saw it, didn't even change your minds then and believe him.
40Mt 21:33 "Listen to another parable: There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. He leased it to tenant farmers and went away.
40Mt 21:34 When the grape harvest drew near, he sent his slaves to the farmers to collect his fruit.
40Mt 21:35 But the farmers took his slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
40Mt 21:36 Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first group, and they did the same to them.
40Mt 21:37 Finally, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.
40Mt 21:38 "But when the tenant farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance!'
40Mt 21:39 So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
40Mt 21:40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"
40Mt 21:41 "He will completely destroy those terrible men," they told Him, "and lease his vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at the harvest."
40Mt 21:42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes?
40Mt 21:43 Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruit.
40Mt 21:44 [[Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder!"]]
40Mt 21:45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they knew He was speaking about them.
40Mt 21:46 Although they were looking for a way to arrest Him, they feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet.
40Mt 22:1 Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables:
40Mt 22:2 "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.
40Mt 22:3 He sent out his slaves to summon those invited to the banquet, but they didn't want to come.
40Mt 22:4 Again, he sent out other slaves, and said, 'Tell those who are invited: Look, I've prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'
40Mt 22:5 "But they paid no attention and went away, one to his own farm, another to his business.
40Mt 22:6 And the others seized his slaves, treated them outrageously and killed them.
40Mt 22:7 The king was enraged, so he sent out his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned down their city.
40Mt 22:8 "Then he told his slaves, 'The banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
40Mt 22:9 Therefore, go to where the roads exit the city and invite everyone you find to the banquet.'
40Mt 22:10 So those slaves went out on the roads and gathered everyone they found, both evil and good. The wedding banquet was filled with guests.
40Mt 22:11 But when the king came in to view the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed for a wedding.
40Mt 22:12 So he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.
40Mt 22:13 "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him up hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 22:14 "For many are invited, but few are chosen."
40Mt 22:15 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to trap Him by what He said.
40Mt 22:16 They sent their disciples to Him, with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that You are truthful and teach truthfully the way of God. You defer to no one, for You don't show partiality.
40Mt 22:17 Tell us, therefore, what You think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
40Mt 22:18 But perceiving their malice, Jesus said, "Why are you testing Me, hypocrites?
40Mt 22:19 Show Me the coin used for the tax." So they brought Him a denarius.
40Mt 22:20 "Whose image and inscription is this?" He asked them.
40Mt 22:21 "Caesar's," they said to Him. Then He said to them, "Therefore, give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
40Mt 22:22 When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.
40Mt 22:23 The same day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up to Him and questioned Him:
40Mt 22:24 "Teacher, Moses said, if a man dies, having no children, his brother is to marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
40Mt 22:25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first got married and died. Having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
40Mt 22:26 The same happened to the second also, and the third, and so to all seven.
40Mt 22:27 Then last of all the woman died.
40Mt 22:28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had married her."
40Mt 22:29 Jesus answered them, "You are deceived, because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God.
40Mt 22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven.
40Mt 22:31 Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read what was spoken to you by God:
40Mt 22:32 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
40Mt 22:33 And when the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.
40Mt 22:34 When the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they came together in the same place.
40Mt 22:35 And one of them, an expert in the law, asked a question to test Him:
40Mt 22:36 "Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?"
40Mt 22:37 He said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
40Mt 22:38 This is the greatest and most important commandment.
40Mt 22:39 The second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
40Mt 22:40 All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments."
40Mt 22:41 While the Pharisees were together, Jesus questioned them,
40Mt 22:42 "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose Son is He?" "David's," they told Him.
40Mt 22:43 He asked them, "How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls Him 'Lord':
40Mt 22:44 The Lord declared to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet'?
40Mt 22:45 "If David calls Him 'Lord,' how then can the Messiah be his Son"
40Mt 22:46 No one was able to answer Him at all, and from that day no one dared to question Him any more.
40Mt 23:1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples:
40Mt 23:2 "The scribes and the Pharisees are seated in the chair of Moses.
40Mt 23:3 Therefore do whatever they tell you and observe [it]. But don't do what they do, because they don't practice what they teach.
40Mt 23:4 They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry and put them on people's shoulders, but they themselves aren't willing to lift a finger to move them.
40Mt 23:5 They do everything to be observed by others: They enlarge their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels.
40Mt 23:6 They love the place of honor at banquets, the front seats in the synagogues,
40Mt 23:7 greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ' Rabbi' by people.
40Mt 23:8 "But as for you, do not be called 'Rabbi,' because you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
40Mt 23:9 Do not call anyone on earth your father, because you have one Father, who is in heaven.
40Mt 23:10 And do not be called masters either, because you have one Master, the Messiah.
40Mt 23:11 The greatest among you will be your servant.
40Mt 23:12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
40Mt 23:13 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You lock up the kingdom of heaven from people. For you don't go in, and you don't allow those entering to go in.
40Mt 23:14 [["Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and make long prayers just for show. This is why you will receive a harsher punishment.]]
40Mt 23:15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as fit for hell as you are!
40Mt 23:16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever takes an oath by the sanctuary, it means nothing. But whoever takes an oath by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by his oath.'
40Mt 23:17 Blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the sanctuary that sanctified the gold?
40Mt 23:18 Also, 'Whoever takes an oath by the altar, it means nothing. But whoever takes an oath by the gift that is on it is bound by his oath.'
40Mt 23:19 Blind people! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
40Mt 23:20 Therefore the one who takes an oath by the altar takes an oath by it and by everything on it.
40Mt 23:21 The one who takes an oath by the sanctuary takes an oath by it and by Him who dwells in it.
40Mt 23:22 And the one who takes an oath by heaven takes an oath by God's throne and by Him who sits on it.
40Mt 23:23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You pay a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin, yet you have neglected the more important matters of the law-- justice, mercy, and faith. These things should have been done without neglecting the others.
40Mt 23:24 Blind guides! You strain out a gnat, yet gulp down a camel!
40Mt 23:25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence!
40Mt 23:26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so the outside of it may also become clean.
40Mt 23:27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and every impurity.
40Mt 23:28 In the same way, on the outside you seem righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
40Mt 23:29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous,
40Mt 23:30 and you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn't have taken part with them in shedding the prophets' blood.'
40Mt 23:31 You therefore testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
40Mt 23:32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers' sins!
40Mt 23:33 "Snakes! Brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned to hell?
40Mt 23:34 This is why I am sending you prophets, sages, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and hound from town to town.
40Mt 23:35 So all the righteous blood shed on the earth will be charged to you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
40Mt 23:36 I assure you: All these things will come on this generation!
40Mt 23:37 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, yet you were not willing!
40Mt 23:38 See, your house is left to you desolate.
40Mt 23:39 For I tell you, you will never see Me again until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"
40Mt 24:1 As Jesus left and was going out of the temple complex, His disciples came up and called His attention to the temple buildings.
40Mt 24:2 Then He replied to them, "Don't you see all these things? I assure you: Not one stone will be left here on another that will not be thrown down!"
40Mt 24:3 While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached Him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what is the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?"
40Mt 24:4 Then Jesus replied to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.
40Mt 24:5 For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Messiah,' and they will deceive many.
40Mt 24:6 You are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, because these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
40Mt 24:7 For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40Mt 24:8 All these events are the beginning of birth pains.
40Mt 24:9 "Then they will hand you over for persecution, and they will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of My name.
40Mt 24:10 Then many will take offense, betray one another and hate one another.
40Mt 24:11 Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
40Mt 24:12 Because lawlessness will multiply, the love of many will grow cold.
40Mt 24:13 But the one who endures to the end will be delivered.
40Mt 24:14 This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world as a testimony to all nations. And then the end will come.
40Mt 24:15 "So when you see the abomination that causes desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place" (let the reader understand),
40Mt 24:16 "then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!
40Mt 24:17 A man on the housetop must not come down to get things out of his house.
40Mt 24:18 And a man in the field must not go back to get his clothes.
40Mt 24:19 Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
40Mt 24:20 Pray that your escape may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
40Mt 24:21 For at that time there will be great tribulation, the kind that hasn't taken place from the beginning of the world until now and never will again!
40Mt 24:22 Unless those days were limited, no one would survive. But those days will be limited because of the elect.
40Mt 24:23 "If anyone tells you then, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Over here!' do not believe it!
40Mt 24:24 False messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
40Mt 24:25 Take note: I have told you in advance.
40Mt 24:26 So if they tell you, 'Look, he's in the wilderness!' don't go out; 'Look, he's in the inner rooms!' do not believe it.
40Mt 24:27 For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40Mt 24:28 Wherever the carcass is, there the vultures will gather.
40Mt 24:29 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial powers will be shaken.
40Mt 24:30 "Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the peoples of the earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
40Mt 24:31 He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
40Mt 24:32 "Now learn this parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.
40Mt 24:33 In the same way, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near-- at the door!
40Mt 24:34 I assure you: This generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place.
40Mt 24:35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
40Mt 24:36 "Now concerning that day and hour no one knows-- neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son-- except the Father only.
40Mt 24:37 As the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.
40Mt 24:38 For in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah boarded the ark.
40Mt 24:39 They didn't know until the flood came and swept them all away. So this is the way the coming of the Son of Man will be:
40Mt 24:40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one left.
40Mt 24:41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one left.
40Mt 24:42 Therefore be alert, since you don't know what day your Lord is coming.
40Mt 24:43 But know this: If the homeowner had known what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed alert and not let his house be broken into.
40Mt 24:44 This is why you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
40Mt 24:45 "Who then is a faithful and sensible slave, whom his master has put in charge of his household, to give them food at the proper time?
40Mt 24:46 That slave whose master finds him working when he comes will be rewarded.
40Mt 24:47 I assure you: He will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40Mt 24:48 But if that wicked slave says in his heart, 'My master is delayed,'
40Mt 24:49 and starts to beat his fellow slaves, and eats and drinks with drunkards,
40Mt 24:50 that slave's master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
40Mt 24:51 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 25:1 "Then the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.
40Mt 25:2 Five of them were foolish and five were sensible.
40Mt 25:3 When the foolish took their lamps, they didn't take oil with them.
40Mt 25:4 But the sensible ones took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
40Mt 25:5 Since the groom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40Mt 25:6 "In the middle of the night there was a shout: 'Here's the groom! Come out to meet him.'
40Mt 25:7 "Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
40Mt 25:8 But the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.'
40Mt 25:9 "The sensible ones answered, 'No, there won't be enough for us and for you. Go instead to those who sell, and buy oil for yourselves.'
40Mt 25:10 "When they had gone to buy some, the groom arrived. Then those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.
40Mt 25:11 "Later the rest of the virgins also came and said, 'Master, master, open up for us!'
40Mt 25:12 "But he replied, ' I assure you: I do not know you!'
40Mt 25:13 "Therefore be alert, because you don't know either the day or the hour.
40Mt 25:14 "For it is just like a man going on a journey. He called his own slaves and turned over his possessions to them.
40Mt 25:15 To one he gave five talents; to another, two; and to another, one-- to each according to his own ability. Then he went on a journey. Immediately
40Mt 25:16 the man who had received five talents went, put them to work, and earned five more.
40Mt 25:17 In the same way the man with two earned two more.
40Mt 25:18 But the man who had received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
40Mt 25:19 "After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
40Mt 25:20 The man who had received five talents approached, presented five more talents, and said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. Look, I've earned five more talents.'
40Mt 25:21 "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Share your master's joy!'
40Mt 25:22 "Then the man with two talents also approached. He said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. Look, I've earned two more talents.'
40Mt 25:23 "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Share your master's joy!'
40Mt 25:24 "Then the man who had received one talent also approached and said, 'Master, I know you. You're a difficult man, reaping where you haven't sown and gathering where you haven't scattered seed.
40Mt 25:25 So I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Look, you have what is yours.'
40Mt 25:26 "But his master replied to him, 'You evil, lazy slave! If you knew that I reap where I haven't sown and gather where I haven't scattered,
40Mt 25:27 then you should have deposited my money with the bankers. And when I returned I would have received my money back with interest.
40Mt 25:28 " 'So take the talent from him and give it to the one who has 10 talents.
40Mt 25:29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
40Mt 25:30 And throw this good-for-nothing slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 25:31 "When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.
40Mt 25:32 All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40Mt 25:33 He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.
40Mt 25:34 Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
40Mt 25:35 For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;
40Mt 25:36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you took care of Me; I was in prison and you visited Me.'
40Mt 25:37 "Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink?
40Mt 25:38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or without clothes and clothe You?
40Mt 25:39 When did we see You sick, or in prison, and visit You?'
40Mt 25:40 "And the King will answer them, 'I assure you: Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.'
40Mt 25:41 Then He will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels!
40Mt 25:42 For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink;
40Mt 25:43 I was a stranger and you didn't take Me in; I was naked and you didn't clothe Me, sick and in prison and you didn't take care of Me.'
40Mt 25:44 "Then they too will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or without clothes, or sick, or in prison, and not help You?'
40Mt 25:45 "Then He will answer them, 'I assure you: Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me either.'
40Mt 25:46 "And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
40Mt 26:1 When Jesus had finished saying all this, He told His disciples,
40Mt 26:2 "You know that the Passover takes place after two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
40Mt 26:3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
40Mt 26:4 and they conspired to arrest Jesus in a treacherous way and kill Him.
40Mt 26:5 "Not during the festival," they said, "so there won't be rioting among the people."
40Mt 26:6 While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon, a man who had a serious skin disease,
40Mt 26:7 a woman approached Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive fragrant oil. She poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table.
40Mt 26:8 When the disciples saw it, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
40Mt 26:9 "This might have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor."
40Mt 26:10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a noble thing for Me.
40Mt 26:11 You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.
40Mt 26:12 By pouring this fragrant oil on My body, she has prepared Me for burial.
40Mt 26:13 I assure you: Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her."
40Mt 26:14 Then one of the Twelve-- the man called Judas Iscariot-- went to the chief priests
40Mt 26:15 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?" So they weighed out 30 pieces of silver for him.
40Mt 26:16 And from that time he started looking for a good opportunity to betray Him.
40Mt 26:17 On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do You want us to prepare the Passover so You may eat it?"
40Mt 26:18 "Go into the city to a certain man," He said, "and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My time is near; I am celebrating the Passover at your place with My disciples. '"
40Mt 26:19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
40Mt 26:20 When evening came, He was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
40Mt 26:21 While they were eating, He said, "I assure you: One of you will betray Me."
40Mt 26:22 Deeply distressed, each one began to say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
40Mt 26:23 He replied, "The one who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl-- he will betray Me.
40Mt 26:24 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
40Mt 26:25 Then Judas, His betrayer, replied, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" "You have said it," He told him.
40Mt 26:26 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take and eat it; this is My body."
40Mt 26:27 Then He took a cup, and after giving thanks, He gave it to them and said, "Drink from it, all of you.
40Mt 26:28 For this is My blood [that establishes] the covenant; it is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
40Mt 26:29 But I tell you, from this moment I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it in a new way in My Father's kingdom with you."
40Mt 26:30 After singing psalms, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40Mt 26:31 Then Jesus said to them, "Tonight all of you will run away because of Me, for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.
40Mt 26:32 But after I have been resurrected, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
40Mt 26:33 Peter told Him, "Even if everyone runs away because of You, I will never run away!"
40Mt 26:34 "I assure you," Jesus said to him, "tonight-- before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times!"
40Mt 26:35 "Even if I have to die with You," Peter told Him, "I will never deny You!" And all the disciples said the same thing.
40Mt 26:36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He told the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
40Mt 26:37 Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
40Mt 26:38 Then He said to them, "My soul is swallowed up in sorrow-- to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with Me."
40Mt 26:39 Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, "My Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will."
40Mt 26:40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter. "So, couldn't you stay awake with Me one hour?
40Mt 26:41 Stay awake and pray, so that you won't enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
40Mt 26:42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, Your will be done."
40Mt 26:43 And He came again and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open.
40Mt 26:44 After leaving them, He went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.
40Mt 26:45 Then He came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the time is near. The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40Mt 26:46 Get up; let's go! See-- My betrayer is near."
40Mt 26:47 While He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived. A large mob, with swords and clubs, was with him from the chief priests and elders of the people.
40Mt 26:48 His betrayer had given them a sign: "The One I kiss, He's the One; arrest Him!"
40Mt 26:49 So he went right up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!"-- and kissed Him.
40Mt 26:50 "Friend," Jesus asked him, "why have you come?" Then they came up, took hold of Jesus, and arrested Him.
40Mt 26:51 At that moment one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword. He struck the high priest's slave and cut off his ear.
40Mt 26:52 Then Jesus told him, "Put your sword back in place because all who take up a sword will perish by a sword.
40Mt 26:53 Or do you think that I cannot call on My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than 12 legions of angels?
40Mt 26:54 How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?"
40Mt 26:55 At that time Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal, to capture Me? Every day I used to sit, teaching in the temple complex, and you didn't arrest Me.
40Mt 26:56 But all this has happened so that the prophetic Scriptures would be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted Him and ran away.
40Mt 26:57 Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had convened.
40Mt 26:58 Meanwhile, Peter was following Him at a distance right to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and was sitting with the temple police to see the outcome.
40Mt 26:59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so they could put Him to death.
40Mt 26:60 But they could not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two who came forward
40Mt 26:61 stated, "This man said, 'I can demolish God's sanctuary and rebuild it in three days.'"
40Mt 26:62 The high priest then stood up and said to Him, "Don't You have an answer to what these men are testifying against You?"
40Mt 26:63 But Jesus kept silent. Then the high priest said to Him, "By the living God I place You under oath: tell us if You are the Messiah, the Son of God!"
40Mt 26:64 "You have said it," Jesus told him. "But I tell you, in the future you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
40Mt 26:65 Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, now you've heard the blasphemy!
40Mt 26:66 What is your decision?" They answered, "He deserves death!"
40Mt 26:67 Then they spit in His face and beat Him; others slapped Him
40Mt 26:68 and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit You?"
40Mt 26:69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant approached him and she said, "You were with Jesus the Galilean too."
40Mt 26:70 But he denied it in front of everyone: "I don't know what you're talking about!"
40Mt 26:71 When he had gone out to the gateway, another woman saw him and told those who were there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene!"
40Mt 26:72 And again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man!"
40Mt 26:73 After a little while those standing there approached and said to Peter, "You certainly are one of them, since even your accent gives you away."
40Mt 26:74 Then he started to curse and to swear with an oath, "I do not know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed,
40Mt 26:75 and Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
40Mt 27:1 When daybreak came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death.
40Mt 27:2 After tying Him up, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate, the governor.
40Mt 27:3 Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was full of remorse and returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
40Mt 27:4 "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood," he said. "What's that to us?" they said. "See to it yourself!"
40Mt 27:5 So he threw the silver into the sanctuary and departed. Then he went and hanged himself.
40Mt 27:6 The chief priests took the silver and said, "It's not lawful to put it into the temple treasury, since it is blood money."
40Mt 27:7 So they conferred together and bought the potter's field with it as a burial place for foreigners.
40Mt 27:8 Therefore that field has been called "Blood Field" to this day.
40Mt 27:9 Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: They took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of Him whose price was set by the sons of Israel,
40Mt 27:10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.
40Mt 27:11 Now Jesus stood before the governor. "Are You the King of the Jews?" the governor asked Him. Jesus answered, "You have said it."
40Mt 27:12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He didn't answer.
40Mt 27:13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Don't You hear how much they are testifying against You?"
40Mt 27:14 But He didn't answer him on even one charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
40Mt 27:15 At the festival the governor's custom was to release to the crowd a prisoner they wanted.
40Mt 27:16 At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
40Mt 27:17 So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Who is it you want me to release for you-- Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Messiah?"
40Mt 27:18 For he knew they had handed Him over because of envy.
40Mt 27:19 While he was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I've suffered terribly in a dream because of Him!"
40Mt 27:20 The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus.
40Mt 27:21 The governor asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" "Barabbas!" they answered.
40Mt 27:22 Pilate asked them, "What should I do then with Jesus, who is called Messiah?" They all answered, "Crucify Him!"
40Mt 27:23 Then he said, "Why? What has He done wrong?" But they kept shouting, "Crucify Him!" all the more.
40Mt 27:24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting instead, he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. See to it yourselves!"
40Mt 27:25 All the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
40Mt 27:26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
40Mt 27:27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into headquarters and gathered the whole company around Him.
40Mt 27:28 They stripped Him and dressed Him in a scarlet robe.
40Mt 27:29 They twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on His head, and placed a reed in His right hand. And they knelt down before Him and mocked Him: "Hail, King of the Jews!"
40Mt 27:30 Then they spit at Him, took the reed, and kept hitting Him on the head.
40Mt 27:31 When they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, put His clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
40Mt 27:32 As they were going out, they found a Cyrenian man named Simon. They forced this man to carry His cross.
40Mt 27:33 When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Skull Place),
40Mt 27:34 they gave Him wine mixed with gall to drink. But when He tasted it, He would not drink it.
40Mt 27:35 After crucifying Him they divided His clothes by casting lots.
40Mt 27:36 Then they sat down and were guarding Him there.
40Mt 27:37 Above His head they put up the charge against Him in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
40Mt 27:38 Then two criminals were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
40Mt 27:39 Those who passed by were yelling insults at Him, shaking their heads
40Mt 27:40 and saying, "The One who would demolish the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
40Mt 27:41 In the same way the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked Him and said,
40Mt 27:42 "He saved others, but He cannot save Himself! He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
40Mt 27:43 He has put His trust in God; let God rescue Him now-- if He wants Him! For He said, 'I am God's Son.'"
40Mt 27:44 In the same way even the criminals who were crucified with Him kept taunting Him.
40Mt 27:45 From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over the whole land.
40Mt 27:46 At about three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, " El? El? lem?sabachth?i? " that is, " My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
40Mt 27:47 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling for Elijah!"
40Mt 27:48 Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, fixed it on a reed, and offered Him a drink.
40Mt 27:49 But the rest said, "Let's see if Elijah comes to save Him!"
40Mt 27:50 Jesus shouted again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit.
40Mt 27:51 Suddenly, the curtain of the sanctuary was split in two from top to bottom; the earth quaked and the rocks were split.
40Mt 27:52 The tombs also were opened and many bodies of the saints who had gone to their rest were raised.
40Mt 27:53 And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
40Mt 27:54 When the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified and said, "This man really was God's Son!"
40Mt 27:55 Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to Him were there, looking on from a distance.
40Mt 27:56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
40Mt 27:57 When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
40Mt 27:58 He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate ordered that it be released.
40Mt 27:59 So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean, fine linen,
40Mt 27:60 and placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut into the rock. He left after rolling a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.
40Mt 27:61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were seated there, facing the tomb.
40Mt 27:62 The next day, which followed the preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
40Mt 27:63 and said, "Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive, He said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
40Mt 27:64 Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come, steal Him, and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' Then the last deception will be worse than the first."
40Mt 27:65 "You have a guard [of soldiers]," Pilate told them. "Go and make it as secure as you know how."
40Mt 27:66 Then they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting the guard.
40Mt 28:1 After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to view the tomb.
40Mt 28:2 Suddenly there was a violent earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and approached [the tomb]. He rolled back the stone and was sitting on it.
40Mt 28:3 His appearance was like lightning, and his robe was as white as snow.
40Mt 28:4 The guards were so shaken from fear of him that they became like dead men.
40Mt 28:5 But the angel told the women, "Don't be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
40Mt 28:6 He is not here! For He has been resurrected, just as He said. Come and see the place where He lay.
40Mt 28:7 Then go quickly and tell His disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead. In fact, He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there.' Listen, I have told you."
40Mt 28:8 So, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to tell His disciples the news.
40Mt 28:9 Just then Jesus met them and said, "Good morning!" They came up, took hold of His feet, and worshiped Him.
40Mt 28:10 Then Jesus told them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see Me there."
40Mt 28:11 As they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
40Mt 28:12 After the priests had assembled with the elders and agreed on a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
40Mt 28:13 and told them, "Say this, 'His disciples came during the night and stole Him while we were sleeping.'
40Mt 28:14 If this reaches the governor's ears, we will deal with him and keep you out of trouble."
40Mt 28:15 So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among Jewish people to this day.
40Mt 28:16 The 11 disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
40Mt 28:17 When they saw Him, they worshiped, but some doubted.
40Mt 28:18 Then Jesus came near and said to them, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
40Mt 28:19 Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
40Mt 28:20 teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
41
41Mk 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
41Mk 1:2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Look, I am sending My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way.
41Mk 1:3 A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord; make His paths straight!"
41Mk 1:4 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41Mk 1:5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
41Mk 1:6 John wore a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey.
41Mk 1:7 He was preaching: "Someone more powerful than I will come after me. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of His sandals.
41Mk 1:8 I have baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41Mk 1:9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
41Mk 1:10 As soon as He came up out of the water, He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending to Him like a dove.
41Mk 1:11 And a voice came from heaven: You are My beloved Son; I take delight in You!
41Mk 1:12 Immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.
41Mk 1:13 He was in the wilderness 40 days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels began to serve Him.
41Mk 1:14 After John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of God:
41Mk 1:15 "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the good news!"
41Mk 1:16 As He was passing along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother. They were casting a net into the sea, since they were fishermen.
41Mk 1:17 "Follow Me," Jesus told them, "and I will make you fish for people!"
41Mk 1:18 Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
41Mk 1:19 Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in their boat mending their nets.
41Mk 1:20 Immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.
41Mk 1:21 Then they went into Capernaum, and right away He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
41Mk 1:22 They were astonished at His teaching because, unlike the scribes, He was teaching them as one having authority.
41Mk 1:23 Just then a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue. He cried out,
41Mk 1:24 "What do You have to do with us, Jesus-- Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-- the Holy One of God!"
41Mk 1:25 But Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
41Mk 1:26 And the unclean spirit convulsed him, shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him.
41Mk 1:27 Then they were all amazed, so they began to argue with one another, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
41Mk 1:28 His fame then spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee.
41Mk 1:29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went into Simon and Andrew's house with James and John.
41Mk 1:30 Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told Him about her at once.
41Mk 1:31 So He went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
41Mk 1:32 When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all those who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.
41Mk 1:33 The whole town was assembled at the door,
41Mk 1:34 and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
41Mk 1:35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He got up, went out, and made His way to a deserted place. And He was praying there.
41Mk 1:36 Simon and his companions went searching for Him.
41Mk 1:37 They found Him and said, "Everyone's looking for You!"
41Mk 1:38 And He said to them, "Let's go on to the neighboring villages so that I may preach there too. This is why I have come."
41Mk 1:39 So He went into all of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
41Mk 1:40 Then a man with a serious skin disease came to Him and, on his knees, begged Him: "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
41Mk 1:41 Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. "I am willing," He told him. "Be made clean."
41Mk 1:42 Immediately the disease left him, and he was healed.
41Mk 1:43 Then He sternly warned him and sent him away at once,
41Mk 1:44 telling him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
41Mk 1:45 Yet he went out and began to proclaim it widely and to spread the news, with the result that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. But He was out in deserted places, and they would come to Him from everywhere.
41Mk 2:1 When He entered Capernaum again after some days, it was reported that He was at home.
41Mk 2:2 So many people gathered together that there was no more room, not even in the doorway, and He was speaking the message to them.
41Mk 2:3 Then they came to Him bringing a paralytic, carried by four men.
41Mk 2:4 Since they were not able to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above where He was. And when they had broken through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.
41Mk 2:5 Seeing their faith, Jesus told the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
41Mk 2:6 But some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking to themselves:
41Mk 2:7 "Why does He speak like this? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41Mk 2:8 Right away Jesus understood in His spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves and said to them, "Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?
41Mk 2:9 Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, pick up your stretcher, and walk'?
41Mk 2:10 But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," He told the paralytic,
41Mk 2:11 "I tell you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home."
41Mk 2:12 Immediately he got up, picked up the stretcher, and went out in front of everyone. As a result, they were all astounded and gave glory to God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
41Mk 2:13 Then Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd was coming to Him, and He taught them.
41Mk 2:14 Then, moving on, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me!" So he got up and followed Him.
41Mk 2:15 While He was reclining at the table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were also guests with Jesus and His disciples, because there were many who were following Him.
41Mk 2:16 When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked His disciples, "Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
41Mk 2:17 When Jesus heard this, He told them, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but the sick [do need one]. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners."
41Mk 2:18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. People came and asked Him, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
41Mk 2:19 Jesus said to them, "The wedding guests cannot fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast.
41Mk 2:20 But the time will come when the groom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
41Mk 2:21 No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new patch pulls away from the old cloth, and a worse tear is made.
41Mk 2:22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins."
41Mk 2:23 On the Sabbath He was going through the grainfields, and His disciples began to make their way picking some heads of grain.
41Mk 2:24 The Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
41Mk 2:25 He said to them, "Have you never read what David and those who were with him did when he was in need and hungry--
41Mk 2:26 how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the sacred bread-- which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests-- and also gave some to his companions?"
41Mk 2:27 Then He told them, "The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.
41Mk 2:28 Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
41Mk 3:1 Now He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a paralyzed hand.
41Mk 3:2 In order to accuse Him, they were watching Him closely to see whether He would heal him on the Sabbath.
41Mk 3:3 He told the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stand before us."
41Mk 3:4 Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
41Mk 3:5 After looking around at them with anger and sorrow at the hardness of their hearts, He told the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
41Mk 3:6 Immediately the Pharisees went out and started plotting with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.
41Mk 3:7 Jesus departed with His disciples to the sea, and a great multitude followed from Galilee, Judea,
41Mk 3:8 Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon. The great multitude came to Him because they heard about everything He was doing.
41Mk 3:9 Then He told His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him, so the crowd would not crush Him.
41Mk 3:10 Since He had healed many, all who had diseases were pressing toward Him to touch Him.
41Mk 3:11 Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, those possessed fell down before Him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
41Mk 3:12 And He would strongly warn them not to make Him known.
41Mk 3:13 Then He went up the mountain and summoned those He wanted, and they came to Him.
41Mk 3:14 He also appointed 12-- He also named them apostles-- to be with Him, to send them out to preach,
41Mk 3:15 and to have authority to drive out demons.
41Mk 3:16 He appointed the Twelve: To Simon, He gave the name Peter;
41Mk 3:17 and to James the son of Zebedee, and to his brother John, He gave the name "Boanerges" (that is, "Sons of Thunder");
41Mk 3:18 Andrew; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot,
41Mk 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
41Mk 3:20 Then He went home, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat.
41Mk 3:21 When His family heard this, they set out to restrain Him, because they said, "He's out of His mind."
41Mk 3:22 The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul in Him!" and, "He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons!"
41Mk 3:23 So He summoned them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?
41Mk 3:24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41Mk 3:25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
41Mk 3:26 And if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished!
41Mk 3:27 "On the other hand, no one can enter a strong man's house and rob his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he will rob his house.
41Mk 3:28 I assure you: People will be forgiven for all sins and whatever blasphemies they may blaspheme.
41Mk 3:29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"--
41Mk 3:30 because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
41Mk 3:31 Then His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent [word] to Him and called Him.
41Mk 3:32 A crowd was sitting around Him and told Him, "Look, Your mother, Your brothers, and Your sisters are outside asking for You."
41Mk 3:33 He replied to them, "Who are My mother and My brothers?"
41Mk 3:34 And looking about at those who were sitting in a circle around Him, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers!
41Mk 3:35 Whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother."
41Mk 4:1 Again He began to teach by the sea, and a very large crowd gathered around Him. So He got into a boat on the sea and sat down, while the whole crowd was on the shore facing the sea.
41Mk 4:2 He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them:
41Mk 4:3 "Listen! Consider the sower who went out to sow.
41Mk 4:4 As he sowed, this occurred: Some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
41Mk 4:5 Other seed fell on rocky ground where it didn't have much soil, and it sprang up right away, since it didn't have deep soil.
41Mk 4:6 When the sun came up, it was scorched, and since it didn't have a root, it withered.
41Mk 4:7 Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it didn't produce a crop.
41Mk 4:8 Still others fell on good ground and produced a crop that increased 30, 60, and 100 times [what was sown]."
41Mk 4:9 Then He said, "Anyone who has ears to hear should listen!"
41Mk 4:10 When He was alone with the Twelve, those who were around Him asked Him about the parables.
41Mk 4:11 He answered them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been granted to you, but to those outside, everything comes in parables
41Mk 4:12 so that they may look and look, yet not perceive; they may listen and listen, yet not understand; otherwise, they might turn back-- and be forgiven."
41Mk 4:13 Then He said to them: "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand any of the parables?
41Mk 4:14 The sower sows the word.
41Mk 4:15 These are the ones along the path where the word is sown: when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word sown in them.
41Mk 4:16 And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy.
41Mk 4:17 But they have no root in themselves; they are short-lived. When affliction or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately stumble.
41Mk 4:18 Others are sown among thorns; these are the ones who hear the word,
41Mk 4:19 but the worries of this age, the seduction of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
41Mk 4:20 But the ones sown on good ground are those who hear the word, welcome it, and produce a crop: 30, 60, and 100 times [what was sown]."
41Mk 4:21 He also said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it to be put on a lampstand?
41Mk 4:22 For nothing is concealed except to be revealed, and nothing hidden except to come to light.
41Mk 4:23 If anyone has ears to hear, he should listen!"
41Mk 4:24 Then He said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear. By the measure you use, it will be measured and added to you.
41Mk 4:25 For to the one who has, it will be given, and from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away."
41Mk 4:26 "The kingdom of God is like this," He said. "A man scatters seed on the ground;
41Mk 4:27 he sleeps and rises-- night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows-- he doesn't know how.
41Mk 4:28 The soil produces a crop by itself-- first the blade, then the head, and then the ripe grain on the head.
41Mk 4:29 But as soon as the crop is ready, he sends for the sickle, because harvest has come."
41Mk 4:30 And He said: "How can we illustrate the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to describe it?
41Mk 4:31 It's like a mustard seed that, when sown in the soil, is smaller than all the seeds on the ground.
41Mk 4:32 And when sown, it comes up and grows taller than all the vegetables, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the sky can nest in its shade."
41Mk 4:33 He would speak the word to them with many parables like these, as they were able to understand.
41Mk 4:34 And He did not speak to them without a parable. Privately, however, He would explain everything to His own disciples.
41Mk 4:35 On that day, when evening had come, He told them, "Let's cross over to the other side [of the lake]."
41Mk 4:36 So they left the crowd and took Him along since He was [already] in the boat. And other boats were with Him.
41Mk 4:37 A fierce windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped.
41Mk 4:38 But He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him up and said to Him, "Teacher! Don't you care that we're going to die?"
41Mk 4:39 He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Silence! Be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
41Mk 4:40 Then He said to them, "Why are you fearful? Do you still have no faith?"
41Mk 4:41 And they were terrified and asked one another, "Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!"
41Mk 5:1 Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.
41Mk 5:2 As soon as He got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met Him.
41Mk 5:3 He lived in the tombs. No one was able to restrain him any more-- even with chains--
41Mk 5:4 because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, but had snapped off the chains and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
41Mk 5:5 And always, night and day, he was crying out among the tombs and in the mountains and cutting himself with stones.
41Mk 5:6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before Him.
41Mk 5:7 And he cried out with a loud voice, "What do You have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God, don't torment me!"
41Mk 5:8 For He had told him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
41Mk 5:9 "What is your name?" He asked him. "My name is Legion," he answered Him, "because we are many."
41Mk 5:10 And he kept begging Him not to send them out of the region.
41Mk 5:11 Now a large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside.
41Mk 5:12 The demons begged Him, "Send us to the pigs, so we may enter them."
41Mk 5:13 And He gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned there.
41Mk 5:14 The men who tended them ran off and reported it in the town and the countryside, and people went to see what had happened.
41Mk 5:15 They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed by the legion, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
41Mk 5:16 The eyewitnesses described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and [told] about the pigs.
41Mk 5:17 Then they began to beg Him to leave their region.
41Mk 5:18 As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging Him to be with Him.
41Mk 5:19 But He would not let him; instead, He told him, "Go back home to your own people, and report to them how much the Lord has done for you and how He has had mercy on you."
41Mk 5:20 So he went out and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.
41Mk 5:21 When Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him while He was by the sea.
41Mk 5:22 One of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at His feet
41Mk 5:23 and kept begging Him, "My little daughter is at death's door. Come and lay Your hands on her so she can get well and live."
41Mk 5:24 So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following and pressing against Him.
41Mk 5:25 A woman suffering from bleeding for 12 years
41Mk 5:26 had endured much under many doctors. She had spent everything she had and was not helped at all. On the contrary, she became worse.
41Mk 5:27 Having heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His robe.
41Mk 5:28 For she said, "If I can just touch His robes, I'll be made well!"
41Mk 5:29 Instantly her flow of blood ceased, and she sensed in her body that she was cured of her affliction.
41Mk 5:30 At once Jesus realized in Himself that power had gone out from Him. He turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My robes?"
41Mk 5:31 His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing against You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'"
41Mk 5:32 So He was looking around to see who had done this.
41Mk 5:33 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came with fear and trembling, fell down before Him, and told Him the whole truth.
41Mk 5:34 "Daughter," He said to her, "your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be free from your affliction."
41Mk 5:35 While He was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader's house and said, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"
41Mk 5:36 But when Jesus overheard what was said, He told the synagogue leader, "Don't be afraid. Only believe."
41Mk 5:37 He did not let anyone accompany Him except Peter, James, and John, James' brother.
41Mk 5:38 They came to the leader's house, and He saw a commotion-- people weeping and wailing loudly.
41Mk 5:39 He went in and said to them, "Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep."
41Mk 5:40 They started laughing at Him, but He put them all outside. He took the child's father, mother, and those who were with Him, and entered the place where the child was.
41Mk 5:41 Then He took the child by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which is translated, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").
41Mk 5:42 Immediately the girl got up and began to walk. (She was 12 years old.) At this they were utterly astounded.
41Mk 5:43 Then He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this and said that she should be given something to eat.
41Mk 6:1 He went away from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.
41Mk 6:2 When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. "Where did this man get these things?" they said. "What is this wisdom given to Him, and how are these miracles performed by His hands?
41Mk 6:3 Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren't His sisters here with us?" So they were offended by Him.
41Mk 6:4 Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his household."
41Mk 6:5 So He was not able to do any miracles there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
41Mk 6:6 And He was amazed at their unbelief. Now He was going around the villages in a circuit, teaching.
41Mk 6:7 He summoned the Twelve and began to send them out in pairs and gave them authority over unclean spirits.
41Mk 6:8 He instructed them to take nothing for the road except a walking stick: no bread, no traveling bag, no money in their belts.
41Mk 6:9 They were to wear sandals, but not put on an extra shirt.
41Mk 6:10 Then He said to them, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.
41Mk 6:11 If any place does not welcome you and people refuse to listen to you, when you leave there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."
41Mk 6:12 So they went out and preached that people should repent.
41Mk 6:13 And they were driving out many demons, anointing many sick people with oil, and healing.
41Mk 6:14 King Herod heard of this, because Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that's why supernatural powers are at work in him."
41Mk 6:15 But others said, "He's Elijah." Still others said, "He's a prophet-- like one of the prophets."
41Mk 6:16 When Herod heard of it, he said, "John, the one I beheaded, has been raised!"
41Mk 6:17 For Herod himself had given orders to arrest John and to chain him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
41Mk 6:18 John had been telling Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife!"
41Mk 6:19 So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not,
41Mk 6:20 because Herod was in awe of John and was protecting him, knowing he was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him he would be very disturbed, yet would hear him gladly.
41Mk 6:21 Now an opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
41Mk 6:22 When Herodias' own daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you want, and I'll give it to you."
41Mk 6:23 So he swore oaths to her: "Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
41Mk 6:24 Then she went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask for?" "John the Baptist's head!" she said.
41Mk 6:25 Immediately she hurried to the king and said, "I want you to give me John the Baptist's head on a platter-- right now!"
41Mk 6:26 Though the king was deeply distressed, because of his oaths and the guests he did not want to refuse her.
41Mk 6:27 The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in prison,
41Mk 6:28 brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother.
41Mk 6:29 When his disciples heard about it, they came and removed his corpse and placed it in a tomb.
41Mk 6:30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to Him all that they had done and taught.
41Mk 6:31 He said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest a while." For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.
41Mk 6:32 So they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place,
41Mk 6:33 but many saw them leaving and recognized them. People ran there by land from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.
41Mk 6:34 So as He stepped ashore, He saw a huge crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. Then He began to teach them many things.
41Mk 6:35 When it was already late, His disciples approached Him and said, "This place is a wilderness, and it is already late!
41Mk 6:36 Send them away, so they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat."
41Mk 6:37 "You give them something to eat," He responded. They said to Him, "Should we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?"
41Mk 6:38 And He asked them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look." When they found out they said, "Five, and two fish."
41Mk 6:39 Then He instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41Mk 6:40 So they sat down in ranks of hundreds and fifties.
41Mk 6:41 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to His disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41Mk 6:42 Everyone ate and was filled.
41Mk 6:43 Then they picked up 12 baskets full of pieces of bread and fish.
41Mk 6:44 Now those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men.
41Mk 6:45 Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.
41Mk 6:46 After He said good-bye to them, He went away to the mountain to pray.
41Mk 6:47 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.
41Mk 6:48 He saw them being battered as they rowed, because the wind was against them. Around three in the morning He came toward them walking on the sea and wanted to pass by them.
41Mk 6:49 When they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out;
41Mk 6:50 for they all saw Him and were terrified. Immediately He spoke with them and said, "Have courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
41Mk 6:51 Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded,
41Mk 6:52 because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.
41Mk 6:53 When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and beached the boat.
41Mk 6:54 As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Him.
41Mk 6:55 They hurried throughout that vicinity and began to carry the sick on stretchers to wherever they heard He was.
41Mk 6:56 Wherever He would go, into villages, towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch just the tassel of His robe. And everyone who touched it was made well.
41Mk 7:1 The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Him.
41Mk 7:2 They observed that some of His disciples were eating their bread with unclean-- that is, unwashed-- hands.
41Mk 7:3 (For the Pharisees, in fact all the Jews, will not eat unless they wash their hands ritually, keeping the tradition of the elders.
41Mk 7:4 When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they have washed. And there are many other customs they have received and keep, like the washing of cups, jugs, copper utensils, and dining couches.)
41Mk 7:5 Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, "Why don't Your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders, instead of eating bread with ritually unclean hands?"
41Mk 7:6 He answered them, "Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
41Mk 7:7 They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.
41Mk 7:8 Disregarding the command of God, you keep the tradition of men."
41Mk 7:9 He also said to them, "You completely invalidate God's command in order to maintain your tradition!
41Mk 7:10 For Moses said: Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.
41Mk 7:11 But you say, 'If a man tells his father or mother: Whatever benefit you might have received from me is Corban ' " (that is, a gift [committed to the temple]),
41Mk 7:12 "you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.
41Mk 7:13 You revoke God's word by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other similar things."
41Mk 7:14 Summoning the crowd again, He told them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:
41Mk 7:15 Nothing that goes into a person from outside can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.
41Mk 7:16 If anyone has ears to hear, he should listen!"
41Mk 7:17 When He went into the house away from the crowd, the disciples asked Him about the parable.
41Mk 7:18 And He said to them, "Are you also as lacking in understanding? Don't you realize that nothing going into a man from the outside can defile him?
41Mk 7:19 For it doesn't go into his heart but into the stomach and is eliminated." (As a result, He made all foods clean.)
41Mk 7:20 Then He said, "What comes out of a person-- that defiles him.
41Mk 7:21 For from within, out of people's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,
41Mk 7:22 adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, lewdness, stinginess, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.
41Mk 7:23 All these evil things come from within and defile a person."
41Mk 7:24 He got up and departed from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, but He could not escape notice.
41Mk 7:25 Instead, immediately after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit came and fell at His feet.
41Mk 7:26 Now the woman was Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she kept asking Him to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41Mk 7:27 He said to her, "Allow the children to be satisfied first, because it isn't right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
41Mk 7:28 But she replied to Him, "Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
41Mk 7:29 Then He told her, "Because of this reply, you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter."
41Mk 7:30 When she went back to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.
41Mk 7:31 Again, leaving the region of Tyre, He went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.
41Mk 7:32 They brought to Him a deaf man who also had a speech difficulty, and begged Jesus to lay His hand on him.
41Mk 7:33 So He took him away from the crowd privately. After putting His fingers in the man's ears and spitting, He touched his tongue.
41Mk 7:34 Then, looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, "Ephphatha!" (that is, "Be opened!").
41Mk 7:35 Immediately his ears were opened, his speech difficulty was removed, and he began to speak clearly.
41Mk 7:36 Then He ordered them to tell no one, but the more He would order them, the more they would proclaim it.
41Mk 7:37 They were extremely astonished and said, "He has done everything well! He even makes deaf people hear, and people unable to speak, talk!"
41Mk 8:1 In those days there was again a large crowd, and they had nothing to eat. He summoned the disciples and said to them,
41Mk 8:2 "I have compassion on the crowd, because they've already stayed with Me three days and have nothing to eat.
41Mk 8:3 If I send them home famished, they will collapse on the way, and some of them have come a long distance."
41Mk 8:4 His disciples answered Him, "Where can anyone get enough bread here in this desolate place to fill these people?"
41Mk 8:5 "How many loaves do you have?" He asked them. "Seven," they said.
41Mk 8:6 Then He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke the [loaves], and kept on giving [them] to His disciples to set before [the people]. So they served the [loaves] to the crowd.
41Mk 8:7 They also had a few small fish, and when He had blessed them, He said these were to be served as well.
41Mk 8:8 They ate and were filled. Then they collected seven large baskets of leftover pieces.
41Mk 8:9 About 4,000 [men] were there. He dismissed them
41Mk 8:10 and immediately got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
41Mk 8:11 The Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, demanding of Him a sign from heaven to test Him.
41Mk 8:12 But sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation demand a sign? I assure you: No sign will be given to this generation!"
41Mk 8:13 Then He left them, got on board [the boat] again, and went to the other side.
41Mk 8:14 They had forgotten to take bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat.
41Mk 8:15 Then he commanded them: "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
41Mk 8:16 They were discussing among themselves that they did not have any bread.
41Mk 8:17 Aware of this, He said to them, "Why are you discussing that you do not have any bread? Do you not yet understand or comprehend? Is your heart hardened?
41Mk 8:18 Do you have eyes, and not see, and do you have ears, and not hear? And do you not remember?
41Mk 8:19 When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many baskets full of pieces of bread did you collect?" "Twelve," they told Him.
41Mk 8:20 "When I broke the seven loaves for the 4,000, how many large baskets full of pieces of bread did you collect?" "Seven," they said.
41Mk 8:21 And He said to them, "Don't you understand yet?"
41Mk 8:22 Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Him and begged Him to touch him.
41Mk 8:23 He took the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village. Spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?"
41Mk 8:24 He looked up and said, "I see people-- they look to me like trees walking."
41Mk 8:25 Again Jesus placed His hands on the man's eyes, and he saw distinctly. He was cured and could see everything clearly.
41Mk 8:26 Then He sent him home, saying, "Don't even go into the village."
41Mk 8:27 Jesus went out with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the road He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
41Mk 8:28 They answered Him, "John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, one of the prophets."
41Mk 8:29 "But you," He asked them again, "who do you say that I am?" Peter answered Him, "You are the Messiah!"
41Mk 8:30 And He strictly warned them to tell no one about Him.
41Mk 8:31 Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, be killed, and rise after three days.
41Mk 8:32 He was openly talking about this. So Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
41Mk 8:33 But turning around and looking at His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, "Get behind Me, Satan, because you're not thinking about God's concerns, but man's!"
41Mk 8:34 Summoning the crowd along with His disciples, He said to them, "If anyone wants to be My follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.
41Mk 8:35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of Me and the gospel will save it.
41Mk 8:36 For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world yet lose his life?
41Mk 8:37 What can a man give in exchange for his life?
41Mk 8:38 For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."
41Mk 9:1 Then He said to them, "I assure you: There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power."
41Mk 9:2 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up on a high mountain by themselves to be alone. He was transformed in front of them,
41Mk 9:3 and His clothes became dazzling-- extremely white as no launderer on earth could whiten them.
41Mk 9:4 Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
41Mk 9:5 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--
41Mk 9:6 because he did not know what he should say, since they were terrified.
41Mk 9:7 A cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud: This is My beloved Son; listen to Him!
41Mk 9:8 Then suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus alone.
41Mk 9:9 As they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41Mk 9:10 They kept this word to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
41Mk 9:11 Then they began to question Him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
41Mk 9:12 "Elijah does come first and restores everything," He replied. "How then is it written about the Son of Man that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
41Mk 9:13 But I tell you that Elijah really has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him."
41Mk 9:14 When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing with them.
41Mk 9:15 All of a sudden, when the whole crowd saw Him, they were amazed and ran to greet Him.
41Mk 9:16 Then He asked them, "What are you arguing with them about?"
41Mk 9:17 Out of the crowd, one man answered Him, "Teacher, I brought my son to You. He has a spirit that makes him unable to speak.
41Mk 9:18 Wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't."
41Mk 9:19 He replied to them, "You unbelieving generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to Me."
41Mk 9:20 So they brought him to Him. When the spirit saw Him, it immediately convulsed the boy. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
41Mk 9:21 "How long has this been happening to him?" Jesus asked his father. "From childhood," he said.
41Mk 9:22 "And many times it has thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."
41Mk 9:23 Then Jesus said to him, " 'If You can?' Everything is possible to the one who believes."
41Mk 9:24 Immediately the father of the boy cried out, "I do believe! Help my unbelief."
41Mk 9:25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly coming together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out of him and never enter him again!"
41Mk 9:26 Then it came out, shrieking and convulsing him violently. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, "He's dead."
41Mk 9:27 But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.
41Mk 9:28 After He went into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
41Mk 9:29 And He told them, "This kind can come out by nothing but prayer [[and fasting]]."
41Mk 9:30 Then they left that place and made their way through Galilee, but He did not want anyone to know it.
41Mk 9:31 For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after He is killed, He will rise three days later."
41Mk 9:32 But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him.
41Mk 9:33 Then they came to Capernaum. When He was in the house, He asked them, "What were you arguing about on the way?"
41Mk 9:34 But they were silent, because on the way they had been arguing with one another about who was the greatest.
41Mk 9:35 Sitting down, He called the Twelve and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
41Mk 9:36 Then He took a child, had him stand among them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them,
41Mk 9:37 "Whoever welcomes one little child such as this in My name welcomes Me. And whoever welcomes Me does not welcome Me, but Him who sent Me."
41Mk 9:38 John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he wasn't following us."
41Mk 9:39 "Don't stop him," said Jesus, "because there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name who can soon afterwards speak evil of Me.
41Mk 9:40 For whoever is not against us is for us.
41Mk 9:41 And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of My name, since you belong to the Messiah-- I assure you: He will never lose his reward.
41Mk 9:42 "But whoever causes the downfall of one of these little ones who believe in Me-- it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
41Mk 9:43 And if your hand causes your downfall, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go to hell-- the unquenchable fire,
41Mk 9:44 [[where Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]]
41Mk 9:45 And if your foot causes your downfall, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell-- [[the unquenchable fire,
41Mk 9:46 where Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]]
41Mk 9:47 And if your eye causes your downfall, gouge it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41Mk 9:48 where Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
41Mk 9:49 For everyone will be salted with fire.
41Mk 9:50 Salt is good, but if the salt should lose its flavor, how can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves and be at peace with one another."
41Mk 10:1 He set out from there and went to the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Then crowds converged on Him again and, as He usually did, He began teaching them once more.
41Mk 10:2 Some Pharisees approached Him to test Him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce [his] wife?"
41Mk 10:3 He replied to them, "What did Moses command you?"
41Mk 10:4 They said, "Moses permitted us to write divorce papers and send her away."
41Mk 10:5 But Jesus told them, "He wrote this commandment for you because of the hardness of your hearts.
41Mk 10:6 But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
41Mk 10:7 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother [[ and be joined to his wife,]]
41Mk 10:8 and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41Mk 10:9 Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate."
41Mk 10:10 Now in the house the disciples questioned Him again about this matter.
41Mk 10:11 And He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
41Mk 10:12 Also, if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
41Mk 10:13 Some people were bringing little children to Him so He might touch them, but His disciples rebuked them.
41Mk 10:14 When Jesus saw it, He was indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to Me. Don't stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41Mk 10:15 I assure you: Whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
41Mk 10:16 After taking them in His arms, He laid His hands on them and blessed them.
41Mk 10:17 As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt down before Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
41Mk 10:18 "Why do you call Me good?" Jesus asked him. "No one is good but One-- God.
41Mk 10:19 You know the commandments: Do not murder; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not defraud; honor your father and mother."
41Mk 10:20 He said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth."
41Mk 10:21 Then, looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, "You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me."
41Mk 10:22 But he was stunned at this demand, and he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.
41Mk 10:23 Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"
41Mk 10:24 But the disciples were astonished at His words. Again Jesus said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
41Mk 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
41Mk 10:26 So they were even more astonished, saying to one another, "Then who can be saved?"
41Mk 10:27 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, because all things are possible with God."
41Mk 10:28 Peter began to tell Him, "Look, we have left everything and followed You."
41Mk 10:29 "I assure you," Jesus said, "there is no one who has left house, brothers or sisters, mother or father, children, or fields because of Me and the gospel,
41Mk 10:30 who will not receive 100 times more, now at this time-- houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions-- and eternal life in the age to come.
41Mk 10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
41Mk 10:32 They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were astonished, but those who followed Him were afraid. Taking the Twelve aside again, He began to tell them the things that would happen to Him.
41Mk 10:33 "Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death. Then they will hand Him over to the Gentiles,
41Mk 10:34 and they will mock Him, spit on Him, flog Him, and kill Him, and He will rise after three days."
41Mk 10:35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him and said, "Teacher, we want You to do something for us if we ask You."
41Mk 10:36 "What do you want Me to do for you?" He asked them.
41Mk 10:37 They answered Him, "Allow us to sit at Your right and at Your left in Your glory."
41Mk 10:38 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you're asking. Are you able to drink the cup I drink or to be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
41Mk 10:39 "We are able," they told Him. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with.
41Mk 10:40 But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to give; instead, it is for those it has been prepared for."
41Mk 10:41 When the [other] 10 [disciples] heard this, they began to be indignant with James and John.
41Mk 10:42 Jesus called them over and said to them, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their men of high positions exercise power over them.
41Mk 10:43 But it must not be like that among you. On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41Mk 10:44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to all.
41Mk 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life-- a ransom for many."
41Mk 10:46 They came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
41Mk 10:47 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, "Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:48 Many people told him to keep quiet, but he was crying out all the more, "Have mercy on me, Son of David!"
41Mk 10:49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called the blind man and said to him, "Have courage! Get up; He's calling for you."
41Mk 10:50 He threw off his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus.
41Mk 10:51 Then Jesus answered him, "What do you want Me to do for you?" "Rabbouni," the blind man told Him, "I want to see!"
41Mk 10:52 "Go your way," Jesus told him. "Your faith has healed you." Immediately he could see and began to follow Him on the road.
41Mk 11:1 When they approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples
41Mk 11:2 and told them, "Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
41Mk 11:3 If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away.'"
41Mk 11:4 So they went and found a young donkey outside in the street, tied by a door. They untied it,
41Mk 11:5 and some of those standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the donkey?"
41Mk 11:6 They answered them just as Jesus had said, so they let them go.
41Mk 11:7 Then they brought the donkey to Jesus and threw their robes on it, and He sat on it.
41Mk 11:8 Many people spread their robes on the road, and others spread leafy branches cut from the fields.
41Mk 11:9 Then those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting: Hosanna!</> Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
41Mk 11:10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!
41Mk 11:11 And He went into Jerusalem and into the temple complex. After looking around at everything, since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
41Mk 11:12 The next day when they came out from Bethany, He was hungry.
41Mk 11:13 After seeing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, He went to find out if there was anything on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
41Mk 11:14 He said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" And His disciples heard it.
41Mk 11:15 They came to Jerusalem, and He went into the temple complex and began to throw out those buying and selling in the temple. He overturned the money changers' tables and the chairs of those selling doves,
41Mk 11:16 and would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple complex.
41Mk 11:17 Then He began to teach them: "Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves!"
41Mk 11:18 Then the chief priests and the scribes heard it and started looking for a way to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, because the whole crowd was astonished by His teaching.
41Mk 11:19 And whenever evening came, they would go out of the city.
41Mk 11:20 Early in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.
41Mk 11:21 Then Peter remembered and said to Him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree that You cursed is withered."
41Mk 11:22 Jesus replied to them, "Have faith in God.
41Mk 11:23 I assure you: If anyone says to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
41Mk 11:24 Therefore, I tell you, all the things you pray and ask for-- believe that you have received them, and you will have them.
41Mk 11:25 And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your wrongdoing.
41Mk 11:26 [[But if you don't forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your wrongdoing."]]
41Mk 11:27 They came again to Jerusalem. As He was walking in the temple complex, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came and asked Him,
41Mk 11:28 "By what authority are You doing these things? Who gave You this authority to do these things?"
41Mk 11:29 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question; then answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41Mk 11:30 Was John's baptism from heaven or from men? Answer Me."
41Mk 11:31 They began to argue among themselves: "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
41Mk 11:32 But if we say, 'From men' "-- they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was a genuine prophet.
41Mk 11:33 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
41Mk 12:1 Then He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug out a pit for a winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went away.
41Mk 12:2 At harvest time he sent a slave to the farmers to collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from the farmers.
41Mk 12:3 But they took him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
41Mk 12:4 Again he sent another slave to them, and they hit him on the head and treated him shamefully.
41Mk 12:5 Then he sent another, and they killed that one. [He] also [sent] many others; they beat some and they killed some.
41Mk 12:6 "He still had one to send, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
41Mk 12:7 "But those tenant farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!'
41Mk 12:8 So they seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
41Mk 12:9 "Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.
41Mk 12:10 Haven't you read this Scripture: The stone that the builders rejected-- this has become the cornerstone.
41Mk 12:11 This came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes?"
41Mk 12:12 Because they knew He had said this parable against them, they were looking for a way to arrest Him, but they were afraid of the crowd. So they left Him and went away.
41Mk 12:13 Then they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to Him to trap Him by what He said.
41Mk 12:14 When they came, they said to Him, "Teacher, we know You are truthful and defer to no one, for You don't show partiality but teach truthfully the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
41Mk 12:15 Should we pay, or should we not pay?" But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at."
41Mk 12:16 So they brought one. "Whose image and inscription is this?" He asked them. "Caesar's," they said.
41Mk 12:17 Then Jesus told them, "Give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at Him.
41Mk 12:18 Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him:
41Mk 12:19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaves his wife behind, and leaves no child, his brother should take the wife and produce offspring for his brother.
41Mk 12:20 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying, left no offspring.
41Mk 12:21 The second also took her, and he died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise.
41Mk 12:22 The seven also left no offspring. Last of all, the woman died too.
41Mk 12:23 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her?"
41Mk 12:24 Jesus told them, "Are you not deceived because you don't know the Scriptures or the power of God?
41Mk 12:25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven.
41Mk 12:26 Now concerning the dead being raised-- haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him: I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
41Mk 12:27 He is not God of the dead but of the living. You are badly deceived."
41Mk 12:28 One of the scribes approached. When he heard them debating and saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked Him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?"
41Mk 12:29 "This is the most important," Jesus answered: Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, The Lord is One.
41Mk 12:30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.
41Mk 12:31 "The second is: Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these."
41Mk 12:32 Then the scribe said to Him, "You are right, Teacher! You have correctly said that He is One, and there is no one else except Him.
41Mk 12:33 And to love Him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is far more [important] than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41Mk 12:34 When Jesus saw that he answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And no one dared to question Him any longer.
41Mk 12:35 So Jesus asked this question as He taught in the temple complex, "How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the Son of David?
41Mk 12:36 David himself says by the Holy Spirit: The Lord declared to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet.'
41Mk 12:37 David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how then can the Messiah be his Son?" And the large crowd was listening to Him with delight.
41Mk 12:38 He also said in His teaching, "Beware of the scribes, who want to go around in long robes, and who want greetings in the marketplaces,
41Mk 12:39 the front seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
41Mk 12:40 They devour widows' houses and say long prayers just for show. These will receive harsher punishment."
41Mk 12:41 Sitting across from the temple treasury, He watched how the crowd dropped money into the treasury. Many rich people were putting in large sums.
41Mk 12:42 And a poor widow came and dropped in two tiny coins worth very little.
41Mk 12:43 Summoning His disciples, He said to them, "I assure you: This poor widow has put in more than all those giving to the temple treasury.
41Mk 12:44 For they all gave out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she possessed-- all she had to live on."
41Mk 13:1 As He was going out of the temple complex, one of His disciples said to Him, "Teacher, look! What massive stones! What impressive buildings!"
41Mk 13:2 Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here on another that will not be thrown down!"
41Mk 13:3 While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple complex, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,
41Mk 13:4 "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to take place?"
41Mk 13:5 Then Jesus began by telling them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.
41Mk 13:6 Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and they will deceive many.
41Mk 13:7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet.
41Mk 13:8 For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
41Mk 13:9 "But you, be on your guard! They will hand you over to sanhedrins, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of Me, as a witness to them.
41Mk 13:10 And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.
41Mk 13:11 So when they arrest you and hand you over, don't worry beforehand what you will say. On the contrary, whatever is given to you in that hour-- say it. For it isn't you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41Mk 13:12 Then brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against parents and put them to death.
41Mk 13:13 And you will be hated by everyone because of My name. But the one who endures to the end will be delivered.
41Mk 13:14 "When you see the abomination that causes desolation standing where it should not" (let the reader understand), "then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!
41Mk 13:15 A man on the housetop must not come down or go in to get anything out of his house.
41Mk 13:16 And a man in the field must not go back to get his clothes.
41Mk 13:17 Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
41Mk 13:18 Pray it won't happen in winter.
41Mk 13:19 For those will be days of tribulation, the kind that hasn't been from the beginning of the world, which God created, until now and never will be again!
41Mk 13:20 Unless the Lord limited those days, no one would survive. But He limited those days because of the elect, whom He chose.
41Mk 13:21 "Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Messiah! Look-- there!' do not believe it!
41Mk 13:22 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the elect.
41Mk 13:23 And you must watch! I have told you everything in advance.
41Mk 13:24 "But in those days, after that tribulation: The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light;
41Mk 13:25 the stars will be falling from the sky, and the celestial powers will be shaken.
41Mk 13:26 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
41Mk 13:27 He will send out the angels and gather His elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.
41Mk 13:28 "Learn this parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.
41Mk 13:29 In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that He is near-- at the door!
41Mk 13:30 I assure you: This generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place.
41Mk 13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
41Mk 13:32 "Now concerning that day or hour no one knows-- neither the angels in heaven nor the Son-- except the Father.
41Mk 13:33 Watch! Be alert! For you don't know when the time is [coming].
41Mk 13:34 It is like a man on a journey, who left his house, gave authority to his slaves, gave each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to be alert.
41Mk 13:35 Therefore be alert, since you don't know when the master of the house is coming-- whether in the evening or at midnight or at the crowing of the rooster or early in the morning.
41Mk 13:36 Otherwise, he might come suddenly and find you sleeping.
41Mk 13:37 And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert!"
41Mk 14:1 After two days it was the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a treacherous way to arrest and kill Him.
41Mk 14:2 "Not during the festival," they said, "or there may be rioting among the people."
41Mk 14:3 While He was in Bethany at the house of Simon who had a serious skin disease, as He was reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of pure and expensive fragrant oil of nard. She broke the jar and poured it on His head.
41Mk 14:4 But some were expressing indignation to one another: "Why has this fragrant oil been wasted?
41Mk 14:5 For this oil might have been sold for more than 300 denarii and given to the poor." And they began to scold her.
41Mk 14:6 Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a noble thing for Me.
41Mk 14:7 You always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have Me.
41Mk 14:8 She has done what she could; she has anointed My body in advance for burial.
41Mk 14:9 I assure you: Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her."
41Mk 14:10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to hand Him over to them.
41Mk 14:11 And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him silver. So he started looking for a good opportunity to betray Him.
41Mk 14:12 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrifice the Passover lamb, His disciples asked Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare the Passover so You may eat it?"
41Mk 14:13 So He sent two of His disciples and told them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a water jug will meet you. Follow him.
41Mk 14:14 Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room for Me to eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
41Mk 14:15 He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there."
41Mk 14:16 So the disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
41Mk 14:17 When evening came, He arrived with the Twelve.
41Mk 14:18 While they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, "I assure you: One of you will betray Me-- one who is eating with Me!"
41Mk 14:19 They began to be distressed and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?"
41Mk 14:20 He said to them, "[It is] one of the Twelve-- the one who is dipping [bread] with Me in the bowl.
41Mk 14:21 For the Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born."
41Mk 14:22 As they were eating, He took bread, blessed and broke it, gave it to them, and said, "Take [it]; this is My body."
41Mk 14:23 Then He took a cup, and after giving thanks, He gave it to them, and so they all drank from it.
41Mk 14:24 He said to them, "This is My blood [that establishes] the covenant; it is shed for many.
41Mk 14:25 I assure you: I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it in a new way in the kingdom of God."
41Mk 14:26 After singing psalms, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41Mk 14:27 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will run away, because it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.
41Mk 14:28 But after I have been resurrected, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
41Mk 14:29 Peter told Him, "Even if everyone runs away, I will certainly not!"
41Mk 14:30 "I assure you," Jesus said to him, "today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times!"
41Mk 14:31 But he kept insisting, "If I have to die with You, I will never deny You!" And they all said the same thing.
41Mk 14:32 Then they came to a place named Gethsemane, and He told His disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
41Mk 14:33 He took Peter, James, and John with Him, and He began to be deeply distressed and horrified.
41Mk 14:34 Then He said to them, "My soul is swallowed up in sorrow-- to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake."
41Mk 14:35 Then He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.
41Mk 14:36 And He said, " Abba, Father! All things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will."
41Mk 14:37 Then He came and found them sleeping. "Simon, are you sleeping?" He asked Peter. "Couldn't you stay awake one hour?
41Mk 14:38 Stay awake and pray so that you won't enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41Mk 14:39 Once again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.
41Mk 14:40 And He came again and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to Him.
41Mk 14:41 Then He came a third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
41Mk 14:42 Get up; let's go! See-- My betrayer is near."
41Mk 14:43 While He was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived. With him was a mob, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
41Mk 14:44 His betrayer had given them a signal. "The One I kiss," he said, "He's the One; arrest Him and take Him away under guard."
41Mk 14:45 So when he came, he went right up to Him and said, "Rabbi!"-- and kissed Him.
41Mk 14:46 Then they took hold of Him and arrested Him.
41Mk 14:47 And one of those who stood by drew his sword, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his ear.
41Mk 14:48 But Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs, as though I were a criminal, to capture Me?
41Mk 14:49 Every day I was among you, teaching in the temple complex, and you didn't arrest Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
41Mk 14:50 Then they all deserted Him and ran away.
41Mk 14:51 Now a certain young man, having a linen cloth wrapped around his naked body, was following Him. They caught hold of him,
41Mk 14:52 but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.
41Mk 14:53 They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes convened.
41Mk 14:54 Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the high priest's courtyard. He was sitting with the temple police, warming himself by the fire.
41Mk 14:55 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they could find none.
41Mk 14:56 For many were giving false testimony against Him, but the testimonies did not agree.
41Mk 14:57 Some stood up and were giving false testimony against Him, stating,
41Mk 14:58 "We heard Him say, 'I will demolish this sanctuary made by [human] hands, and in three days I will build another not made by hands.'"
41Mk 14:59 Yet their testimony did not agree even on this.
41Mk 14:60 Then the high priest stood up before them all and questioned Jesus, "Don't You have an answer to what these men are testifying against You?"
41Mk 14:61 But He kept silent and did not answer anything. Again the high priest questioned Him, "Are You the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41Mk 14:62 "I am," said Jesus, "and all of you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven."
41Mk 14:63 Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "Why do we still need witnesses?
41Mk 14:64 You have heard the blasphemy! What is your decision?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
41Mk 14:65 Then some began to spit on Him, to blindfold Him, and to beat Him, saying, "Prophesy!" Even the temple police took Him and slapped Him.
41Mk 14:66 While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the high priest's servants came.
41Mk 14:67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus."
41Mk 14:68 But he denied it: "I don't know or understand what you're talking about!" Then he went out to the entryway, and a rooster crowed.
41Mk 14:69 When the servant saw him again she began to tell those standing nearby, "This man is one of them!"
41Mk 14:70 But again he denied it. After a little while those standing there said to Peter again, "You certainly are one of them, since you're also a Galilean!"
41Mk 14:71 Then he started to curse and to swear with an oath, "I don't know this man you're talking about!"
41Mk 14:72 Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter remembered when Jesus had spoken the word to him, "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times." When he thought about it, he began to weep.
41Mk 15:1 As soon as it was morning, the chief priests had a meeting with the elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin. After tying Jesus up, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate.
41Mk 15:2 So Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "You have said it."
41Mk 15:3 And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things.
41Mk 15:4 Then Pilate questioned Him again, "Are You not answering anything? Look how many things they are accusing You of!"
41Mk 15:5 But Jesus still did not answer anything, so Pilate was amazed.
41Mk 15:6 At the festival it was Pilate's custom to release for the people a prisoner they requested.
41Mk 15:7 There was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder during the rebellion.
41Mk 15:8 The crowd came up and began to ask [Pilate] to do for them as was his custom.
41Mk 15:9 So Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?"
41Mk 15:10 For he knew it was because of envy that the chief priests had handed Him over.
41Mk 15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas to them instead.
41Mk 15:12 Pilate asked them again, "Then what do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?"
41Mk 15:13 Again they shouted, "Crucify Him!"
41Mk 15:14 Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What has He done wrong?" But they shouted, "Crucify Him!" all the more.
41Mk 15:15 Then, willing to gratify the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. And after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
41Mk 15:16 Then the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard (that is, headquarters) and called the whole company together.
41Mk 15:17 They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and put it on Him.
41Mk 15:18 And they began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
41Mk 15:19 They kept hitting Him on the head with a reed and spitting on Him. Getting down on their knees, they were paying Him homage.
41Mk 15:20 When they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple robe, put His clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.
41Mk 15:21 They forced a man coming in from the country, who was passing by, to carry Jesus' cross. He was Simon, a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus.
41Mk 15:22 And they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means Skull Place).
41Mk 15:23 They tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.
41Mk 15:24 Then they crucified Him and divided His clothes, casting lots for them to decide what each would get.
41Mk 15:25 Now it was nine in the morning when they crucified Him.
41Mk 15:26 The inscription of the charge written against Him was THE KING OF THE JEWS
41Mk 15:27 They crucified two criminals with Him, one on His right and one on His left.
41Mk 15:28 [[So the Scripture was fulfilled that says: And He was counted among outlaws.]]
41Mk 15:29 Those who passed by were yelling insults at Him, shaking their heads, and saying, "Ha! The One who would demolish the sanctuary and build it in three days,
41Mk 15:30 save Yourself by coming down from the cross!"
41Mk 15:31 In the same way, the chief priests with the scribes were mocking Him to one another and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself!
41Mk 15:32 Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe." Even those who were crucified with Him were taunting Him.
41Mk 15:33 When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
41Mk 15:34 And at three Jesus cried out with a loud voice, " Eloi, Eloi, lem?sabachth?i?" which is translated, " My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
41Mk 15:35 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "Look, He's calling for Elijah!"
41Mk 15:36 Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, fixed it on a reed, offered Him a drink, and said, "Let's see if Elijah comes to take Him down!"
41Mk 15:37 But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed His last.
41Mk 15:38 Then the curtain of the sanctuary was split in two from top to bottom.
41Mk 15:39 When the centurion, who was standing opposite Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "This man really was God's Son!"
41Mk 15:40 There were also women looking on from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41Mk 15:41 When He was in Galilee, they would follow Him and help Him. Many other women had come up with Him to Jerusalem.
41Mk 15:42 When it was already evening, because it was preparation day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),
41Mk 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came and boldly went in to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
41Mk 15:44 Pilate was surprised that He was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether He had already died.
41Mk 15:45 When he found out from the centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph.
41Mk 15:46 After he bought some fine linen, he took Him down and wrapped Him in the linen. Then he placed Him in a tomb cut out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
41Mk 15:47 Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where He was placed.
41Mk 16:1 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so they could go and anoint Him.
41Mk 16:2 Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they went to the tomb at sunrise.
41Mk 16:3 They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us?"
41Mk 16:4 Looking up, they observed that the stone-- which was very large-- had been rolled away.
41Mk 16:5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; they were amazed and alarmed.
41Mk 16:6 "Don't be alarmed," he told them. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has been resurrected! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.
41Mk 16:7 But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there just as He told you.'"
41Mk 16:8 So they went out and started running from the tomb, because trembling and astonishment overwhelmed them. And they said nothing to anyone, since they were afraid.
41Mk 16:9 [[Early on the first day of the week, after He had risen, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had driven seven demons.
41Mk 16:10 She went and reported to those who had been with Him, as they were mourning and weeping.
41Mk 16:11 Yet, when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.
41Mk 16:12 Then after this, He appeared in a different form to two of them walking on their way into the country.
41Mk 16:13 And they went and reported it to the rest, who did not believe them either.
41Mk 16:14 Later, He appeared to the Eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw Him after He had been resurrected.
41Mk 16:15 Then He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.
41Mk 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
41Mk 16:17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;
41Mk 16:18 they will pick up snakes; if they should drink anything deadly, it will never harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well."
41Mk 16:19 Then after speaking to them, the Lord Jesus was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
41Mk 16:20 And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the accompanying signs.]]
42
42Lk 1:1 Many have undertaken to compile a narrative about the events that have been fulfilled among us,
42Lk 1:2 just as the original eyewitnesses and servants of the word handed them down to us.
42Lk 1:3 It also seemed good to me, since I have carefully investigated everything from the very first, to write to you in orderly sequence, most honorable Theophilus,
42Lk 1:4 so that you may know the certainty of the things about which you have been instructed.
42Lk 1:5 In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest of Abijah's division named Zechariah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:6 Both were righteous in God's sight, living without blame according to all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.
42Lk 1:7 But they had no children because Elizabeth could not conceive, and both of them were well along in years.
42Lk 1:8 When his division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
42Lk 1:9 it happened that he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense.
42Lk 1:10 At the hour of incense the whole assembly of the people was praying outside.
42Lk 1:11 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.
42Lk 1:12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and overcome with fear.
42Lk 1:13 But the angel said to him: Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John.
42Lk 1:14 There will be joy and delight for you, and many will rejoice at his birth.
42Lk 1:15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord and will never drink wine or beer. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother's womb.
42Lk 1:16 He will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.
42Lk 1:17 And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.
42Lk 1:18 "How can I know this?" Zechariah asked the angel. "For I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years."
42Lk 1:19 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and tell you this good news.
42Lk 1:20 Now listen! You will become silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
42Lk 1:21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.
42Lk 1:22 When he did come out, he could not speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them and remained speechless.
42Lk 1:23 When the days of his ministry were completed, he went back home.
42Lk 1:24 After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived and kept herself in seclusion for five months. She said,
42Lk 1:25 "The Lord has done this for me. He has looked with favor in these days to take away my disgrace among the people."
42Lk 1:26 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
42Lk 1:27 to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
42Lk 1:28 And [the angel] came to her and said, "Rejoice, favored woman! The Lord is with you."
42Lk 1:29 But she was deeply troubled by this statement, wondering what kind of greeting this could be.
42Lk 1:30 Then the angel told her: Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
42Lk 1:31 Now listen: You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will call His name JESUS.
42Lk 1:32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.
42Lk 1:33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.
42Lk 1:34 Mary asked the angel, "How can this be, since I have not been intimate with a man?"
42Lk 1:35 The angel replied to her: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
42Lk 1:36 And consider your relative Elizabeth-- even she has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.
42Lk 1:37 For nothing will be impossible with God."
42Lk 1:38 "I am the Lord's slave," said Mary. "May it be done to me according to your word." Then the angel left her.
42Lk 1:39 In those days Mary set out and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah
42Lk 1:40 where she entered Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped inside her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42Lk 1:42 Then she exclaimed with a loud cry: You are the most blessed of women, and your child will be blessed!
42Lk 1:43 How could this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42Lk 1:44 For you see, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped for joy inside me!
42Lk 1:45 She who has believed is blessed because what was spoken to her by the Lord will be fulfilled!"
42Lk 1:46 And Mary said: My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
42Lk 1:47 and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
42Lk 1:48 because He has looked with favor on the humble condition of His slave. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed,
42Lk 1:49 because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and His name is holy.
42Lk 1:50 His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear Him.
42Lk 1:51 He has done a mighty deed with His arm; He has scattered the proud because of the thoughts of their hearts;
42Lk 1:52 He has toppled the mighty from their thrones and exalted the lowly.
42Lk 1:53 He has satisfied the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty.
42Lk 1:54 He has helped His servant Israel, mindful of His mercy,
42Lk 1:55 just as He spoke to our ancestors, to Abraham and his descendants forever.
42Lk 1:56 And Mary stayed with her about three months; then she returned to her home.
42Lk 1:57 Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she had a son.
42Lk 1:58 Then her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her His great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
42Lk 1:59 When they came to circumcise the child on the eighth day, they were going to name him Zechariah, after his father.
42Lk 1:60 But his mother responded, "No! He will be called John."
42Lk 1:61 Then they said to her, "None of your relatives has that name."
42Lk 1:62 So they motioned to his father to find out what he wanted him to be called.
42Lk 1:63 He asked for a writing tablet and wrote: HIS NAME IS JOHN And they were all amazed.
42Lk 1:64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue [set free], and he began to speak, praising God.
42Lk 1:65 Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these things were being talked about throughout the hill country of Judea.
42Lk 1:66 All who heard about [him] took [it] to heart, saying, "What then will this child become?" For, indeed, the Lord's hand was with him.
42Lk 1:67 Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
42Lk 1:68 Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and provided redemption for His people.
42Lk 1:69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,
42Lk 1:70 just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets in ancient times;
42Lk 1:71 salvation from our enemies and from the clutches of those who hate us.
42Lk 1:72 He has dealt mercifully with our fathers and remembered His holy covenant--
42Lk 1:73 the oath that He swore to our father Abraham. He has given us the privilege,
42Lk 1:74 since we have been rescued from our enemies' clutches, to serve Him without fear
42Lk 1:75 in holiness and righteousness in His presence all our days.
42Lk 1:76 And child, you will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,
42Lk 1:77 to give His people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins.
42Lk 1:78 Because of our God's merciful compassion, the Dawn from on high will visit us
42Lk 1:79 to shine on those who live in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
42Lk 1:80 The child grew up and became spiritually strong, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
42Lk 2:1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole empire should be registered.
42Lk 2:2 This first registration took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
42Lk 2:3 So everyone went to be registered, each to his own town.
42Lk 2:4 And Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David,
42Lk 2:5 to be registered along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was pregnant.
42Lk 2:6 While they were there, the time came for her to give birth.
42Lk 2:7 Then she gave birth to her firstborn Son, and she wrapped Him snugly in cloth and laid Him in a feeding trough-- because there was no room for them at the inn.
42Lk 2:8 In the same region, shepherds were staying out in the fields and keeping watch at night over their flock.
42Lk 2:9 Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
42Lk 2:10 But the angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for look, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:
42Lk 2:11 today a Savior, who is Messiah the Lord, was born for you in the city of David.
42Lk 2:12 This will be the sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped snugly in cloth and lying in a manger."
42Lk 2:13 Suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying:
42Lk 2:14 Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to people He favors!
42Lk 2:15 When the angels had left them and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go straight to Bethlehem and see what has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."
42Lk 2:16 They hurried off and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the feeding trough.
42Lk 2:17 After seeing [them], they reported the message they were told about this child,
42Lk 2:18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
42Lk 2:19 But Mary was treasuring up all these things in her heart and meditating on them.
42Lk 2:20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had seen and heard, just as they had been told.
42Lk 2:21 When the eight days were completed for His circumcision, He was named JESUS-- the name given by the angel before He was conceived.
42Lk 2:22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were finished, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
42Lk 2:23 (just as it is written in the law of the Lord: Every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord)
42Lk 2:24 and to offer a sacrifice (according to what is stated in the law of the Lord: a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons).
42Lk 2:25 There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking forward to Israel's consolation, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
42Lk 2:26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he saw the Lord's Messiah.
42Lk 2:27 Guided by the Spirit, he entered the temple complex. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform for Him what was customary under the law,
42Lk 2:28 Simeon took Him up in his arms, praised God, and said:
42Lk 2:29 Now, Master, You can dismiss Your slave in peace, according to Your word.
42Lk 2:30 For my eyes have seen Your salvation.
42Lk 2:31 You have prepared [it] in the presence of all peoples--
42Lk 2:32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and glory to Your people Israel.
42Lk 2:33 His father and mother were amazed at what was being said about Him.
42Lk 2:34 Then Simeon blessed them and told His mother Mary: "Indeed, this child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be opposed--
42Lk 2:35 and a sword will pierce your own soul-- that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42Lk 2:36 There was also a prophetess, Anna, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well along in years, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
42Lk 2:37 and was a widow for 84 years. She did not leave the temple complex, serving God night and day with fastings and prayers.
42Lk 2:38 At that very moment, she came up and began to thank God and to speak about Him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
42Lk 2:39 When they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
42Lk 2:40 The boy grew up and became strong, filled with wisdom, and God's grace was on Him.
42Lk 2:41 Every year His parents traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.
42Lk 2:42 When He was 12 years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival.
42Lk 2:43 After those days were over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but His parents did not know it.
42Lk 2:44 Assuming He was in the traveling party, they went a day's journey. Then they began looking for Him among their relatives and friends.
42Lk 2:45 When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him.
42Lk 2:46 After three days, they found Him in the temple complex sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
42Lk 2:47 And all those who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers.
42Lk 2:48 When His parents saw Him, they were astonished, and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You."
42Lk 2:49 "Why were you searching for Me?" He asked them. "Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?"
42Lk 2:50 But they did not understand what He said to them.
42Lk 2:51 Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother kept all these things in her heart.
42Lk 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and with people.
42Lk 3:1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
42Lk 3:2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, God's word came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
42Lk 3:3 He went into all the vicinity of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
42Lk 3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah: A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord; make His paths straight!
42Lk 3:5 Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made low; the crooked will become straight, the rough ways smooth,
42Lk 3:6 and everyone will see the salvation of God."
42Lk 3:7 He then said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
42Lk 3:8 Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance. And don't start saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!
42Lk 3:9 Even now the ax is ready to strike the root of the trees! Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
42Lk 3:10 "What then should we do?" the crowds were asking him.
42Lk 3:11 He replied to them, "The one who has two shirts must share with someone who has none, and the one who has food must do the same."
42Lk 3:12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?"
42Lk 3:13 He told them, "Don't collect any more than what you have been authorized."
42Lk 3:14 Some soldiers also questioned him: "What should we do?" He said to them, "Don't take money from anyone by force or false accusation; be satisfied with your wages."
42Lk 3:15 Now the people were waiting expectantly, and all of them were debating in their minds whether John might be the Messiah.
42Lk 3:16 John answered them all, "I baptize you with water, but One is coming who is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42Lk 3:17 His winnowing shovel is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with a fire that never goes out."
42Lk 3:18 Then, along with many other exhortations, he proclaimed good news to the people.
42Lk 3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him about Herodias, his brother's wife, and about all the evil things Herod had done,
42Lk 3:20 added this to everything else-- he locked John up in prison.
42Lk 3:21 When all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. As He was praying, heaven opened,
42Lk 3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in a physical appearance like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: You are My beloved Son. I take delight in You!
42Lk 3:23 As He began [His ministry], Jesus was about 30 years old and was thought to be the son of Joseph, [son] of Heli,
42Lk 3:24 [son] of Matthat, [son] of Levi, [son] of Melchi, [son] of Jannai, [son] of Joseph,
42Lk 3:25 [son] of Mattathias, [son] of Amos, [son] of Nahum, [son] of Esli, [son] of Naggai,
42Lk 3:26 [son] of Maath, [son] of Mattathias, [son] of Semein, [son] of Josech, [son] of Joda,
42Lk 3:27 [son] of Joanan, [son] of Rhesa, [son] of Zerubbabel, [son] of Shealtiel, [son] of Neri,
42Lk 3:28 [son] of Melchi, [son] of Addi, [son] of Cosam, [son] of Elmadam, [son] of Er,
42Lk 3:29 [son] of Joshua, [son] of Eliezer, [son] of Jorim, [son] of Matthat, [son] of Levi,
42Lk 3:30 [son] of Simeon, [son] of Judah, [son] of Joseph, [son] of Jonam, [son] of Eliakim,
42Lk 3:31 [son] of Melea, [son] of Menna, [son] of Mattatha, [son] of Nathan, [son] of David,
42Lk 3:32 [son] of Jesse, [son] of Obed, [son] of Boaz, [son] of Salmon, [son] of Nahshon,
42Lk 3:33 [son] of Amminadab, [son] of Ram, [son] of Hezron, [son] of Perez, [son] of Judah,
42Lk 3:34 [son] of Jacob, [son] of Isaac, [son] of Abraham, [son] of Terah, [son] of Nahor,
42Lk 3:35 [son] of Serug, [son] of Reu, [son] of Peleg, [son] of Eber, [son] of Shelah,
42Lk 3:36 [son] of Cainan, [son] of Arphaxad, [son] of Shem, [son] of Noah, [son] of Lamech,
42Lk 3:37 [son] of Methuselah, [son] of Enoch, [son] of Jared, [son] of Mahalaleel, [son] of Cainan,
42Lk 3:38 [son] of Enos, [son] of Seth, [son] of Adam, [son] of God.
42Lk 4:1 Then Jesus returned from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness
42Lk 4:2 for 40 days to be tempted by the Devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were over, He was hungry.
42Lk 4:3 The Devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
42Lk 4:4 But Jesus answered him, "It is written: Man must not live on bread alone."
42Lk 4:5 So he took Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
42Lk 4:6 The Devil said to Him, "I will give You their splendor and all this authority, because it has been given over to me, and I can give it to anyone I want.
42Lk 4:7 If You, then, will worship me, all will be Yours."
42Lk 4:8 And Jesus answered him, "It is written: Worship the Lord your God, and Him serve Him only."
42Lk 4:9 So he took Him to Jerusalem, had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.
42Lk 4:10 For it is written: He will give His angels orders concerning you, to protect you,
42Lk 4:11 and they will support you with their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."
42Lk 4:12 And Jesus answered him, "It is said: Do not test the Lord your God."
42Lk 4:13 After the Devil had finished every temptation, he departed from Him for a time.
42Lk 4:14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread throughout the entire vicinity.
42Lk 4:15 He was teaching in their synagogues, being acclaimed by everyone.
42Lk 4:16 He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. As usual, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read.
42Lk 4:17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to Him, and unrolling the scroll, He found the place where it was written:
42Lk 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, because He has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim freedom to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed,
42Lk 4:19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
42Lk 4:20 He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
42Lk 4:21 He began by saying to them, "Today as you listen, this Scripture has been fulfilled."
42Lk 4:22 They were all speaking well of Him and were amazed by the gracious words that came from His mouth, yet they said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
42Lk 4:23 Then He said to them, "No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me: 'Doctor, heal yourself.' 'All we've heard that took place in Capernaum, do here in Your hometown also.'"
42Lk 4:24 He also said, "I assure you: No prophet is accepted in his hometown.
42Lk 4:25 But I say to you, there were certainly many widows in Israel in Elijah's days, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months while a great famine came over all the land.
42Lk 4:26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them-- but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.
42Lk 4:27 And in the prophet Elisha's time, there were many in Israel who had serious skin diseases, yet not one of them was healed-- only Naaman the Syrian."
42Lk 4:28 When they heard this, everyone in the synagogue was enraged.
42Lk 4:29 They got up, drove Him out of town, and brought Him to the edge of the hill their town was built on, intending to hurl Him over the cliff.
42Lk 4:30 But He passed right through the crowd and went on His way.
42Lk 4:31 Then He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.
42Lk 4:32 They were astonished at His teaching because His message had authority.
42Lk 4:33 In the synagogue there was a man with an unclean demonic spirit who cried out with a loud voice,
42Lk 4:34 "Leave us alone! What do You have to do with us, Jesus-- Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-- the Holy One of God!"
42Lk 4:35 But Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be quiet and come out of him!" And throwing him down before them, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.
42Lk 4:36 They were all struck with amazement and kept saying to one another, "What is this message? For He commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!"
42Lk 4:37 And news about Him began to go out to every place in the vicinity.
42Lk 4:38 After He left the synagogue, He entered Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him about her.
42Lk 4:39 So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and began to serve them.
42Lk 4:40 When the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with various diseases brought them to Him. As He laid His hands on each one of them, He would heal them.
42Lk 4:41 Also, demons were coming out of many, shouting and saying, "You are the Son of God!" But He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew He was the Messiah.
42Lk 4:42 When it was day, He went out and made His way to a deserted place. But the crowds were searching for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them.
42Lk 4:43 But He said to them, "I must proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose."
42Lk 4:44 And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
42Lk 5:1 As the crowd was pressing in on Jesus to hear God's word, He was standing by Lake Gennesaret.
42Lk 5:2 He saw two boats at the edge of the lake; the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
42Lk 5:3 He got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from the land. Then He sat down and was teaching the crowds from the boat.
42Lk 5:4 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
42Lk 5:5 "Master," Simon replied, "we've worked hard all night long and caught nothing! But at Your word, I'll let down the nets."
42Lk 5:6 When they did this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets began to tear.
42Lk 5:7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
42Lk 5:8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, because I'm a sinful man, Lord!"
42Lk 5:9 For he and all those with him were amazed at the catch of fish they took,
42Lk 5:10 and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were Simon's partners. "Don't be afraid," Jesus told Simon. "From now on you will be catching people!"
42Lk 5:11 Then they brought the boats to land, left everything, and followed Him.
42Lk 5:12 While He was in one of the towns, a man was there who had a serious skin disease all over him. He saw Jesus, fell facedown, and begged Him: "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
42Lk 5:13 Reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, "I am willing; be made clean," and immediately the disease left him.
42Lk 5:14 Then He ordered him to tell no one: "But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer what Moses prescribed for your cleansing as a testimony to them."
42Lk 5:15 But the news about Him spread even more, and large crowds would come together to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
42Lk 5:16 Yet He often withdrew to deserted places and prayed.
42Lk 5:17 On one of those days while He was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea, and also from Jerusalem. And the Lord's power to heal was in Him.
42Lk 5:18 Just then some men came, carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and set him down before Him.
42Lk 5:19 Since they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the roof tiles into the middle of the crowd before Jesus.
42Lk 5:20 Seeing their faith He said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven you."
42Lk 5:21 Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason: "Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
42Lk 5:22 But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus replied to them, "Why are you reasoning this in your hearts?
42Lk 5:23 Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
42Lk 5:24 But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-- He told the paralyzed man, "I tell you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home."
42Lk 5:25 Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
42Lk 5:26 Then everyone was astounded, and they were giving glory to God. And they were filled with awe and said, "We have seen incredible things today!"
42Lk 5:27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me!"
42Lk 5:28 So, leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow Him.
42Lk 5:29 Then Levi hosted a grand banquet for Him at his house. Now there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were guests with them.
42Lk 5:30 But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to His disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42Lk 5:31 Jesus replied to them, "The healthy don't need a doctor, but the sick do.
42Lk 5:32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42Lk 5:33 Then they said to Him, "John's disciples fast often and say prayers, and those of the Pharisees do the same, but Yours eat and drink."
42Lk 5:34 Jesus said to them, "You can't make the wedding guests fast while the groom is with them, can you?
42Lk 5:35 But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them-- then they will fast in those days."
42Lk 5:36 He also told them a parable: "No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise, not only will he tear the new, but also the piece from the new garment will not match the old.
42Lk 5:37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, it will spill, and the skins will be ruined.
42Lk 5:38 But new wine should be put into fresh wineskins.
42Lk 5:39 And no one, after drinking old wine, wants new, because he says, 'The old is better.'"
42Lk 6:1 On a Sabbath, He passed through the grainfields. His disciples were picking heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.
42Lk 6:2 But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
42Lk 6:3 Jesus answered them, "Haven't you read what David and those who were with him did when he was hungry--
42Lk 6:4 how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat? He even gave some to those who were with him."
42Lk 6:5 Then He told them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42Lk 6:6 On another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching. A man was there whose right hand was paralyzed.
42Lk 6:7 The scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely, to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could find a charge against Him.
42Lk 6:8 But He knew their thoughts and told the man with the paralyzed hand, "Get up and stand here." So he got up and stood there.
42Lk 6:9 Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you: is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
42Lk 6:10 After looking around at them all, He told him, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was restored.
42Lk 6:11 They, however, were filled with rage and started discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.
42Lk 6:12 During those days He went out to the mountain to pray and spent all night in prayer to God.
42Lk 6:13 When daylight came, He summoned His disciples, and He chose 12 of them-- He also named them apostles:
42Lk 6:14 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
42Lk 6:15 Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;
42Lk 6:16 Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42Lk 6:17 After coming down with them, He stood on a level place with a large crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.
42Lk 6:18 They came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those tormented by unclean spirits were made well.
42Lk 6:19 The whole crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was coming out from Him and healing them all.
42Lk 6:20 Then looking up at His disciples, He said: Blessed are you who are poor, because the kingdom of God is yours.
42Lk 6:21 Blessed are you who are hungry now, because you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, because you will laugh.
42Lk 6:22 Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you, insult you, and slander your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
42Lk 6:23 "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! Take note-- your reward is great in heaven, because this is the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets.
42Lk 6:24 But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your comfort.
42Lk 6:25 Woe to you who are full now, because you will be hungry. Woe to you who are laughing now, because you will mourn and weep.
42Lk 6:26 Woe to you when all people speak well of you, because this is the way their ancestors used to treat the false prophets.
42Lk 6:27 "But I say to you who listen: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42Lk 6:28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42Lk 6:29 If anyone hits you on the cheek, offer the other also. And if anyone takes away your coat, don't hold back your shirt either.
42Lk 6:30 Give to everyone who asks from you, and from one who takes away your things, don't ask for them back.
42Lk 6:31 Just as you want others to do for you, do the same for them.
42Lk 6:32 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
42Lk 6:33 If you do [what is] good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
42Lk 6:34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners to be repaid in full.
42Lk 6:35 But love your enemies, do [what is] good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is gracious to the ungrateful and evil.
42Lk 6:36 Be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.
42Lk 6:37 "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42Lk 6:38 Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure-- pressed down, shaken together, and running over-- will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."
42Lk 6:39 He also told them a parable: "Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?
42Lk 6:40 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
42Lk 6:41 "Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but don't notice the log in your own eye?
42Lk 6:42 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the log in your eye? Hypocrite! First take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in your brother's eye.
42Lk 6:43 "A good tree doesn't produce bad fruit; on the other hand, a bad tree doesn't produce good fruit.
42Lk 6:44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs aren't gathered from thornbushes, or grapes picked from a bramble bush.
42Lk 6:45 A good man produces good out of the good storeroom of his heart. An evil man produces evil out of the evil storeroom, for his mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.
42Lk 6:46 "Why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things I say?
42Lk 6:47 I will show you what someone is like who comes to Me, hears My words, and acts on them:
42Lk 6:48 He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the river crashed against that house and couldn't shake it, because it was well built.
42Lk 6:49 But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The river crashed against it, and immediately it collapsed. And the destruction of that house was great!"
42Lk 7:1 When He had concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.
42Lk 7:2 A centurion's slave, who was highly valued by him, was sick and about to die.
42Lk 7:3 When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to Him, requesting Him to come and save the life of his slave.
42Lk 7:4 When they reached Jesus, they pleaded with Him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for You to grant this,
42Lk 7:5 because he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue."
42Lk 7:6 Jesus went with them, and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell Him, "Lord, don't trouble Yourself, since I am not worthy to have You come under my roof.
42Lk 7:7 That is why I didn't even consider myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be cured.
42Lk 7:8 For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."
42Lk 7:9 Jesus heard this and was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, "I tell you, I have not found so great a faith even in Israel!"
42Lk 7:10 When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
42Lk 7:11 Soon afterwards He was on His way to a town called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were traveling with Him.
42Lk 7:12 Just as He neared the gate of the town, a dead man was being carried out. He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was also with her.
42Lk 7:13 When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said, "Don't cry."
42Lk 7:14 Then He came up and touched the open coffin, and the pallbearers stopped. And He said, "Young man, I tell you, get up!"
42Lk 7:15 The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.
42Lk 7:16 Then fear came over everyone, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has risen among us," and "God has visited His people."
42Lk 7:17 This report about Him went throughout Judea and all the vicinity.
42Lk 7:18 Then John's disciples told him about all these things. So John summoned two of his disciples
42Lk 7:19 and sent them to the Lord, asking, "Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for someone else?"
42Lk 7:20 When the men reached Him, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to ask You, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for someone else?'"
42Lk 7:21 At that time Jesus healed many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits, and He granted sight to many blind people.
42Lk 7:22 He replied to them, "Go and report to John the things you have seen and heard: The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with skin diseases are healed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news preached to them.
42Lk 7:23 And anyone who is not offended because of Me is blessed."
42Lk 7:24 After John's messengers left, He began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
42Lk 7:25 What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft robes? Look, those who are splendidly dressed and live in luxury are in royal palaces.
42Lk 7:26 What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.
42Lk 7:27 This is the one it is written about: Look, I am sending My messenger ahead of You; he will prepare Your way before You.
42Lk 7:28 I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John, but the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42Lk 7:29 (And when all the people, including the tax collectors, heard this, they acknowledged God's way of righteousness, because they had been baptized with John's baptism.
42Lk 7:30 But since the Pharisees and experts in the law had not been baptized by him, they rejected the plan of God for themselves.)
42Lk 7:31 "To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?
42Lk 7:32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other: We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance; we sang a lament, but you didn't weep!
42Lk 7:33 For John the Baptist did not come eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon!'
42Lk 7:34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
42Lk 7:35 Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
42Lk 7:36 Then one of the Pharisees invited Him to eat with him. He entered the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
42Lk 7:37 And a woman in the town who was a sinner found out that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house. She brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil
42Lk 7:38 and stood behind Him at His feet, weeping, and began to wash His feet with her tears. She wiped His feet with the hair of her head, kissing them and anointing them with the fragrant oil.
42Lk 7:39 When the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching Him-- she's a sinner!"
42Lk 7:40 Jesus replied to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he said, "say it."
42Lk 7:41 "A creditor had two debtors. One owed 500 denarii, and the other 50.
42Lk 7:42 Since they could not pay it back, he graciously forgave them both. So, which of them will love him more?"
42Lk 7:43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one he forgave more." "You have judged correctly," He told him.
42Lk 7:44 Turning to the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has washed My feet and wiped them with her hair.
42Lk 7:45 You gave Me no kiss, but she hasn't stopped kissing My feet since I came in.
42Lk 7:46 You didn't anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with fragrant oil.
42Lk 7:47 Therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; that's why she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little."
42Lk 7:48 Then He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 7:49 Those who were at the table with Him began to say among themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?"
42Lk 7:50 And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
42Lk 8:1 Soon afterwards He was traveling from one town and village to another, preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him,
42Lk 8:2 and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary, called Magdalene (seven demons had come out of her);
42Lk 8:3 Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others who were supporting them from their possessions.
42Lk 8:4 As a large crowd was gathering, and people were flocking to Him from every town, He said in a parable:
42Lk 8:5 "A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the sky ate it up.
42Lk 8:6 Other seed fell on the rock; when it sprang up, it withered, since it lacked moisture.
42Lk 8:7 Other seed fell among thorns; the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.
42Lk 8:8 Still other seed fell on good ground; when it sprang up, it produced a crop: 100 times [what was sown]." As He said this, He called out, "Anyone who has ears to hear should listen!"
42Lk 8:9 Then His disciples asked Him, "What does this parable mean?"
42Lk 8:10 So He said, "The secrets of the kingdom of God have been given for you to know, but to the rest it is in parables, so that Looking they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
42Lk 8:11 "This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.
42Lk 8:12 The seeds along the path are those who have heard. Then the Devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
42Lk 8:13 And the seeds on the rock are those who, when they hear, welcome the word with joy. Having no root, these believe for a while and depart in a time of testing.
42Lk 8:14 As for the seed that fell among thorns, these are the ones who, when they have heard, go on their way and are choked with worries, riches, and pleasures of life, and produce no mature fruit.
42Lk 8:15 But the seed in the good ground-- these are the ones who, having heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold on to it and by enduring, bear fruit.
42Lk 8:16 "No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light.
42Lk 8:17 For nothing is concealed that won't be revealed, and nothing hidden that won't be made known and come to light.
42Lk 8:18 Therefore, take care how you listen. For whoever has, more will be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him."
42Lk 8:19 Then His mother and brothers came to Him, but they could not meet with Him because of the crowd.
42Lk 8:20 He was told, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You."
42Lk 8:21 But He replied to them, "My mother and My brothers are those who hear and do the word of God."
42Lk 8:22 One day He and His disciples got into a boat, and He told them, "Let's cross over to the other side of the lake." So they set out,
42Lk 8:23 and as they were sailing He fell asleep. Then a fierce windstorm came down on the lake; they were being swamped and were in danger.
42Lk 8:24 They came and woke Him up, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to die!" Then He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. So they ceased, and there was a calm.
42Lk 8:25 He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were fearful and amazed, asking one another, "Who can this be? He commands even the winds and the waves, and they obey Him!"
42Lk 8:26 Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
42Lk 8:27 When He got out on land, a demon-possessed man from the town met Him. For a long time he had worn no clothes and did not stay in a house but in the tombs.
42Lk 8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What do You have to do with me, Jesus, You Son of the Most High God? I beg You, don't torment me!"
42Lk 8:29 For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and although he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.
42Lk 8:30 "What is your name?" Jesus asked him. "Legion," he said-- because many demons had entered him.
42Lk 8:31 And they begged Him not to banish them to the abyss.
42Lk 8:32 A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. The demons begged Him to permit them to enter the pigs, and He gave them permission.
42Lk 8:33 The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
42Lk 8:34 When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran off and reported it in the town and in the countryside.
42Lk 8:35 Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man the demons had departed from, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.
42Lk 8:36 Meanwhile the eyewitnesses reported to them how the demon-possessed man was delivered.
42Lk 8:37 Then all the people of the Gerasene region asked Him to leave them, because they were gripped by great fear. So getting into the boat, He returned.
42Lk 8:38 The man from whom the demons had departed kept begging Him to be with Him. But He sent him away and said,
42Lk 8:39 "Go back to your home, and tell all that God has done for you." And off he went, proclaiming throughout the town all that Jesus had done for him.
42Lk 8:40 When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all expecting Him.
42Lk 8:41 Just then, a man named Jairus came. He was a leader of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet and pleaded with Him to come to his house,
42Lk 8:42 because he had an only daughter about 12 years old, and she was at death's door. While He was going, the crowds were nearly crushing Him.
42Lk 8:43 A woman suffering from bleeding for 12 years, who had spent all she had on doctors yet could not be healed by any,
42Lk 8:44 approached from behind and touched the tassel of His robe. Instantly her bleeding stopped.
42Lk 8:45 "Who touched Me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the crowds are hemming You in and pressing against You."
42Lk 8:46 "Somebody did touch Me," said Jesus. "I know that power has gone out from Me."
42Lk 8:47 When the woman saw that she was discovered, she came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she declared the reason she had touched Him and how she was instantly cured.
42Lk 8:48 "Daughter," He said to her, "your faith has made you well. Go in peace."
42Lk 8:49 While He was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's [house], saying, "Your daughter is dead. Don't bother the Teacher anymore."
42Lk 8:50 When Jesus heard it, He answered him, "Don't be afraid. Only believe, and she will be made well."
42Lk 8:51 After He came to the house, He let no one enter with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child's father and mother.
42Lk 8:52 Everyone was crying and mourning for her. But He said, "Stop crying, for she is not dead but asleep."
42Lk 8:53 They started laughing at Him, because they knew she was dead.
42Lk 8:54 So He took her by the hand and called out, "Child, get up!"
42Lk 8:55 Her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then He gave orders that she be given something to eat.
42Lk 8:56 Her parents were astounded, but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
42Lk 9:1 Summoning the Twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and [power] to heal diseases.
42Lk 9:2 Then He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42Lk 9:3 "Take nothing for the road," He told them, "no walking stick, no traveling bag, no bread, no money; and don't take an extra shirt.
42Lk 9:4 Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.
42Lk 9:5 If they do not welcome you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
42Lk 9:6 So they went out and traveled from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.
42Lk 9:7 Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was going on. He was perplexed, because some said that John had been raised from the dead,
42Lk 9:8 some that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
42Lk 9:9 "I beheaded John," Herod said, "but who is this I hear such things about?" And he wanted to see Him.
42Lk 9:10 When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all that they had done. He took them along and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.
42Lk 9:11 When the crowds found out, they followed Him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing.
42Lk 9:12 Late in the day, the Twelve approached and said to Him, "Send the crowd away, so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find food and lodging, because we are in a deserted place here."
42Lk 9:13 "You give them something to eat," He told them. "We have no more than five loaves and two fish," they said, "unless we go and buy food for all these people."
42Lk 9:14 (For about 5,000 men were there.) Then He told His disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each."
42Lk 9:15 They did so, and had them all sit down.
42Lk 9:16 Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them. He kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
42Lk 9:17 Everyone ate and was filled. Then they picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces.
42Lk 9:18 While He was praying in private and His disciples were with Him, He asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
42Lk 9:19 They answered, "John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back."
42Lk 9:20 "But you," He asked them, "who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah!"
42Lk 9:21 But He strictly warned and instructed them to tell this to no one,
42Lk 9:22 saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and be raised the third day."
42Lk 9:23 Then He said to [them] all, "If anyone wants to come with Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me.
42Lk 9:24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of Me will save it.
42Lk 9:25 What is a man benefited if he gains the whole world, yet loses or forfeits himself?
42Lk 9:26 For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and that of the Father and the holy angels.
42Lk 9:27 I tell you the truth: there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:28 About eight days after these words, He took along Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
42Lk 9:29 As He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became dazzling white.
42Lk 9:30 Suddenly, two men were talking with Him-- Moses and Elijah.
42Lk 9:31 They appeared in glory and were speaking of His death, which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:32 Peter and those with him were in a deep sleep, and when they became fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him.
42Lk 9:33 As the two men were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it's good for us to be here! Let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"-- not knowing what he said.
42Lk 9:34 While he was saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. They became afraid as they entered the cloud.
42Lk 9:35 Then a voice came from the cloud, saying: This is My Son, the Chosen One; listen to Him!
42Lk 9:36 After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was found. They kept silent, and in those days told no one what they had seen.
42Lk 9:37 The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.
42Lk 9:38 Just then a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, because he's my only [child].
42Lk 9:39 Often a spirit seizes him; suddenly he shrieks, and it throws him into convulsions until he foams at the mouth; wounding him, it hardly ever leaves him.
42Lk 9:40 I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't."
42Lk 9:41 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and rebellious generation! How long will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
42Lk 9:42 As the boy was still approaching, the demon knocked him down and threw him into severe convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.
42Lk 9:43 And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was amazed at all the things He was doing, He told His disciples,
42Lk 9:44 "Let these words sink in: the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."
42Lk 9:45 But they did not understand this statement; it was concealed from them so that they could not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.
42Lk 9:46 Then an argument started among them about who would be the greatest of them.
42Lk 9:47 But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, took a little child and had him stand next to Him.
42Lk 9:48 He told them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me. And whoever welcomes Me welcomes Him who sent Me. For whoever is least among you-- this one is great."
42Lk 9:49 John responded, "Master, we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow us."
42Lk 9:50 "Don't stop him," Jesus told him, "because whoever is not against you is for you."
42Lk 9:51 When the days were coming to a close for Him to be taken up, He determined to journey to Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:52 He sent messengers ahead of Him, and on the way they entered a village of the Samaritans to make preparations for Him.
42Lk 9:53 But they did not welcome Him, because He determined to journey to Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:54 When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?"
42Lk 9:55 But He turned and rebuked them,
42Lk 9:56 and they went to another village.
42Lk 9:57 As they were traveling on the road someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go!"
42Lk 9:58 Jesus told him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head."
42Lk 9:59 Then He said to another, "Follow Me." "Lord," he said, "first let me go bury my father."
42Lk 9:60 But He told him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and spread the news of the kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:61 Another also said, "I will follow You, Lord, but first let me go and say good-bye to those at my house."
42Lk 9:62 But Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
42Lk 10:1 After this, the Lord appointed 70 others, and He sent them ahead of Him in pairs to every town and place where He Himself was about to go.
42Lk 10:2 He told them: "The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.
42Lk 10:3 Now go; I'm sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42Lk 10:4 Don't carry a money-bag, traveling bag, or sandals; don't greet anyone along the road.
42Lk 10:5 Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this household.'
42Lk 10:6 If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.
42Lk 10:7 Remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they offer, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Don't be moving from house to house.
42Lk 10:8 When you enter any town, and they welcome you, eat the things set before you.
42Lk 10:9 Heal the sick who are there, and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near you.'
42Lk 10:10 When you enter any town, and they don't welcome you, go out into its streets and say,
42Lk 10:11 'We are wiping off [as a witness] against you even the dust of your town that clings to our feet. Know this for certain: the kingdom of God has come near.'
42Lk 10:12 I tell you, on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.
42Lk 10:13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes!
42Lk 10:14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
42Lk 10:15 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades!
42Lk 10:16 Whoever listens to you listens to Me. Whoever rejects you rejects Me. And whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me."
42Lk 10:17 The Seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name."
42Lk 10:18 He said to them, "I watched Satan fall from heaven like a lightning flash.
42Lk 10:19 Look, I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will ever harm you.
42Lk 10:20 However, don't rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
42Lk 10:21 In that same hour He rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, because this was Your good pleasure.
42Lk 10:22 All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal Him."
42Lk 10:23 Then turning to His disciples He said privately, "The eyes that see the things you see are blessed!
42Lk 10:24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see yet didn't see them; to hear the things you hear yet didn't hear them."
42Lk 10:25 Just then an expert in the law stood up to test Him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 10:26 "What is written in the law?" He asked him. "How do you read it?"
42Lk 10:27 He answered: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.
42Lk 10:28 "You've answered correctly," He told him. "Do this and you will live."
42Lk 10:29 But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42Lk 10:30 Jesus took up [the question] and said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him up, and fled, leaving him half dead.
42Lk 10:31 A priest happened to be going down that road. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
42Lk 10:32 In the same way, a Levite, when he arrived at the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42Lk 10:33 But a Samaritan on his journey came up to him, and when he saw [the man], he had compassion.
42Lk 10:34 He went over to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
42Lk 10:35 The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, 'Take care of him. When I come back I'll reimburse you for whatever extra you spend.'
42Lk 10:36 "Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?"
42Lk 10:37 "The one who showed mercy to him," he said. Then Jesus told him, "Go and do the same."
42Lk 10:38 While they were traveling, He entered a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
42Lk 10:39 She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet and was listening to what He said.
42Lk 10:40 But Martha was distracted by her many tasks, and she came up and asked, "Lord, don't You care that my sister has left me to serve alone? So tell her to give me a hand."
42Lk 10:41 The Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,
42Lk 10:42 but one thing is necessary. Mary has made the right choice, and it will not be taken away from her."
42Lk 11:1 He was praying in a certain place, and when He finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."
42Lk 11:2 He said to them, "Whenever you pray, say: Father, Your name be honored as holy. Your kingdom come.
42Lk 11:3 Give us each day our daily bread.
42Lk 11:4 And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone in debt to us. And do not bring us into temptation."
42Lk 11:5 He also said to them: "Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
42Lk 11:6 because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I don't have anything to offer him.'
42Lk 11:7 Then he will answer from inside and say, 'Don't bother me! The door is already locked, and my children and I have gone to bed. I can't get up to give you anything.'
42Lk 11:8 I tell you, even though he won't get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
42Lk 11:9 "So I say to you, keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you.
42Lk 11:10 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who searches finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
42Lk 11:11 What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?
42Lk 11:12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
42Lk 11:13 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"
42Lk 11:14 Now He was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon came out, the man who had been mute, spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
42Lk 11:15 But some of them said, "He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons!"
42Lk 11:16 And others, as a test, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.
42Lk 11:17 Knowing their thoughts, He told them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is headed for destruction, and a house divided against itself falls.
42Lk 11:18 If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
42Lk 11:19 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, who is it your sons drive them out by? For this reason they will be your judges.
42Lk 11:20 If I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
42Lk 11:21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his estate, his possessions are secure.
42Lk 11:22 But when one stronger than he attacks and overpowers him, he takes from him all his weapons he trusted in, and divides up his plunder.
42Lk 11:23 Anyone who is not with Me is against Me, and anyone who does not gather with Me scatters.
42Lk 11:24 "When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it roams through waterless places looking for rest, and not finding rest, it then says, 'I'll go back to my house where I came from.'
42Lk 11:25 And returning, it finds [the house] swept and put in order.
42Lk 11:26 Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and settle down there. As a result, that man's last condition is worse than the first."
42Lk 11:27 As He was saying these things, a woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "The womb that bore You and the one who nursed You are blessed!"
42Lk 11:28 He said, "Even more, those who hear the word of God and keep it are blessed!"
42Lk 11:29 As the crowds were increasing, He began saying: "This generation is an evil generation. It demands a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
42Lk 11:30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.
42Lk 11:31 The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and look-- something greater than Solomon is here!
42Lk 11:32 The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at Jonah's proclamation, and look-- something greater than Jonah is here!
42Lk 11:33 "No one lights a lamp and puts it in the cellar or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light.
42Lk 11:34 Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light. But when it is bad, your body is also full of darkness.
42Lk 11:35 Take care then, that the light in you is not darkness.
42Lk 11:36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, the whole body will be full of light, as when a lamp shines its light on you."
42Lk 11:37 As He was speaking, a Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. So He went in and reclined at the table.
42Lk 11:38 When the Pharisee saw this, he was amazed that He did not first perform the ritual washing before dinner.
42Lk 11:39 But the Lord said to him: "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and evil.
42Lk 11:40 Fools! Didn't He who made the outside make the inside too?
42Lk 11:41 But give to charity what is within, and then everything is clean for you.
42Lk 11:42 "But woe to you Pharisees! You give a tenth of mint, rue, and every kind of herb, and you bypass justice and love for God. These things you should have done without neglecting the others.
42Lk 11:43 "Woe to you Pharisees! You love the front seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
42Lk 11:44 "Woe to you! You are like unmarked graves; the people who walk over them don't know it."
42Lk 11:45 One of the experts in the law answered Him, "Teacher, when You say these things You insult us too."
42Lk 11:46 Then He said: "Woe also to you experts in the law! You load people with burdens that are hard to carry, yet you yourselves don't touch these burdens with one of your fingers.
42Lk 11:47 "Woe to you! You build monuments to the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
42Lk 11:48 Therefore you are witnesses that you approve the deeds of your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their monuments.
42Lk 11:49 Because of this, the wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,'
42Lk 11:50 so that this generation may be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world--
42Lk 11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. "Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible.
42Lk 11:52 "Woe to you experts in the law! You have taken away the key of knowledge! You didn't go in yourselves, and you hindered those who were going in."
42Lk 11:53 When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose Him fiercely and to cross-examine Him about many things;
42Lk 11:54 they were lying in wait for Him to trap Him in something He said.
42Lk 12:1 In these circumstances, a crowd of many thousands came together, so that they were trampling on one another. He began to say to His disciples first: "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
42Lk 12:2 There is nothing covered that won't be uncovered, nothing hidden that won't be made known.
42Lk 12:3 Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in an ear in private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
42Lk 12:4 "And I say to you, My friends, don't fear those who kill the body, and after that can do nothing more.
42Lk 12:5 But I will show you the One to fear: Fear Him who has authority to throw [people] into hell after death. Yes, I say to you, this is the One to fear!
42Lk 12:6 Aren't five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God's sight.
42Lk 12:7 Indeed, the hairs of your head are all counted. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows!
42Lk 12:8 "And I say to you, anyone who acknowledges Me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God,
42Lk 12:9 but whoever denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
42Lk 12:10 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42Lk 12:11 Whenever they bring you before synagogues and rulers and authorities, don't worry about how you should defend yourselves or what you should say.
42Lk 12:12 For the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what must be said."
42Lk 12:13 Someone from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
42Lk 12:14 "Friend," He said to him, "who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?"
42Lk 12:15 He then told them, "Watch out and be on guard against all greed because one's life is not in the abundance of his possessions."
42Lk 12:16 Then He told them a parable: "A rich man's land was very productive.
42Lk 12:17 He thought to himself, 'What should I do, since I don't have anywhere to store my crops?
42Lk 12:18 I will do this,' he said. 'I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and store all my grain and my goods there.
42Lk 12:19 Then I'll say to myself, "You have many goods stored up for many years. Take it easy; eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."'
42Lk 12:20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life is demanded of you. And the things you have prepared-- whose will they be?'
42Lk 12:21 "That's how it is with the one who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."
42Lk 12:22 Then He said to His disciples: "Therefore I tell you, don't worry about your life, what you will eat; or about the body, what you will wear.
42Lk 12:23 For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
42Lk 12:24 Consider the ravens: they don't sow or reap; they don't have a storeroom or a barn; yet God feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than the birds?
42Lk 12:25 Can any of you add a cubit to his height by worrying?
42Lk 12:26 If then you're not able to do even a little thing, why worry about the rest?
42Lk 12:27 "Consider how the wildflowers grow: they don't labor or spin thread. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was adorned like one of these!
42Lk 12:28 If that's how God clothes the grass, which is in the field today and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will He do for you-- you of little faith?
42Lk 12:29 Don't keep striving for what you should eat and what you should drink, and don't be anxious.
42Lk 12:30 For the Gentile world eagerly seeks all these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
42Lk 12:31 "But seek His kingdom, and these things will be provided for you.
42Lk 12:32 Don't be afraid, little flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom.
42Lk 12:33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Make money-bags for yourselves that won't grow old, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
42Lk 12:34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
42Lk 12:35 "Be ready for service and have your lamps lit.
42Lk 12:36 You must be like people waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet so that when he comes and knocks, they can open [the door] for him at once.
42Lk 12:37 Those slaves the master will find alert when he comes will be blessed. I assure you: He will get ready, have them recline at the table, then come and serve them.
42Lk 12:38 If he comes in the middle of the night, or even near dawn, and finds them alert, those slaves are blessed.
42Lk 12:39 But know this: if the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
42Lk 12:40 You also be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect."
42Lk 12:41 "Lord," Peter asked, "are You telling this parable to us or to everyone?"
42Lk 12:42 The Lord said: "Who then is the faithful and sensible manager his master will put in charge of his household servants to give them their allotted food at the proper time?
42Lk 12:43 That slave whose master finds him working when he comes will be rewarded.
42Lk 12:44 I tell you the truth: he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42Lk 12:45 But if that slave says in his heart, 'My master is delaying his coming,' and starts to beat the male and female slaves, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
42Lk 12:46 that slave's master will come on a day he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42Lk 12:47 And that slave who knew his master's will and didn't prepare himself or do it will be severely beaten.
42Lk 12:48 But the one who did not know and did things deserving of blows will be beaten lightly. Much will be required of everyone who has been given much. And even more will be expected of the one who has been entrusted with more.
42Lk 12:49 "I came to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already set ablaze!
42Lk 12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how it consumes Me until it is finished!
42Lk 12:51 Do you think that I came here to give peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!
42Lk 12:52 From now on, five in one household will be divided: three against two, and two against three.
42Lk 12:53 They will be divided, father against son, son against father, mother against daughter, daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
42Lk 12:54 He also said to the crowds: "When you see a cloud rising in the west, right away you say, 'A storm is coming,' and so it does.
42Lk 12:55 And when the south wind is blowing, you say, 'It's going to be a scorcher!' and it is.
42Lk 12:56 Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why don't you know how to interpret this time?
42Lk 12:57 "Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
42Lk 12:58 As you are going with your adversary to the ruler, make an effort to settle with him on the way. Then he won't drag you before the judge, the judge hand you over to the bailiff, and the bailiff throw you into prison.
42Lk 12:59 I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last cent."
42Lk 13:1 At that time, some people came and reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
42Lk 13:2 And He responded to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all Galileans because they suffered these things?
42Lk 13:3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!
42Lk 13:4 Or those 18 that the tower in Siloam fell on and killed-- do you think they were more sinful than all the people who live in Jerusalem?
42Lk 13:5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!"
42Lk 13:6 And He told this parable: "A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it and found none.
42Lk 13:7 He told the vineyard worker, 'Listen, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it even waste the soil?'
42Lk 13:8 "But he replied to him, 'Sir, leave it this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.
42Lk 13:9 Perhaps it will bear fruit next year, but if not, you can cut it down.'"
42Lk 13:10 As He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,
42Lk 13:11 a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for over 18 years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
42Lk 13:12 When Jesus saw her, He called out to her, "Woman, you are free of your disability."
42Lk 13:13 Then He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was restored and began to glorify God.
42Lk 13:14 But the leader of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, responded by telling the crowd, "There are six days when work should be done; therefore come on those days and be healed and not on the Sabbath day."
42Lk 13:15 But the Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you untie his ox or donkey from the feeding trough on the Sabbath, and lead it to water?
42Lk 13:16 Satan has bound this woman, a daughter of Abraham, for 18 years-- shouldn't she be untied from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
42Lk 13:17 When He had said these things, all His adversaries were humiliated, but the whole crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things He was doing.
42Lk 13:18 He said therefore, "What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?
42Lk 13:19 It's like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches."
42Lk 13:20 Again He said, "What can I compare the kingdom of God to?
42Lk 13:21 It's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into 50 pounds of flour until it spread through the entire mixture."
42Lk 13:22 He went through one town and village after another, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem.
42Lk 13:23 "Lord," someone asked Him, "are there few being saved?" He said to them,
42Lk 13:24 "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because I tell you, many will try to enter and won't be able
42Lk 13:25 once the homeowner gets up and shuts the door. Then you will stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up for us!' He will answer you, 'I don't know you or where you're from.'
42Lk 13:26 Then you will say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!'
42Lk 13:27 But He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know you or where you're from. Get away from Me, all you workers of unrighteousness!'
42Lk 13:28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth in that place, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but yourselves thrown out.
42Lk 13:29 They will come from east and west, from north and south, and recline at the table in the kingdom of God.
42Lk 13:30 Note this: some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last."
42Lk 13:31 At that time some Pharisees came and told Him, "Go, get out of here! Herod wants to kill You!"
42Lk 13:32 He said to them, "Go tell that fox, 'Look! I'm driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete My work.'
42Lk 13:33 Yet I must travel today, tomorrow, and the next day, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem!
42Lk 13:34 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
42Lk 13:35 See, your house is abandoned to you. And I tell you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"
42Lk 14:1 One Sabbath, when He went to eat at the house of one of the leading Pharisees, they were watching Him closely.
42Lk 14:2 There in front of Him was a man whose body was swollen with fluid.
42Lk 14:3 In response, Jesus asked the law experts and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"
42Lk 14:4 But they kept silent. He took the man, healed him, and sent him away.
42Lk 14:5 And to them, He said, "Which of you whose son or ox falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
42Lk 14:6 To this they could find no answer.
42Lk 14:7 He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noticed how they would choose the best places for themselves:
42Lk 14:8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, don't recline at the best place, because a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by your host.
42Lk 14:9 The one who invited both of you may come and say to you, 'Give your place to this man,' and then in humiliation, you will proceed to take the lowest place.
42Lk 14:10 "But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up higher.' You will then be honored in the presence of all the other guests.
42Lk 14:11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
42Lk 14:12 He also said to the one who had invited Him, "When you give a lunch or a dinner, don't invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your rich neighbors, because they might invite you back, and you would be repaid.
42Lk 14:13 On the contrary, when you host a banquet, invite those who are poor, maimed, lame, or blind.
42Lk 14:14 And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
42Lk 14:15 When one of those who reclined at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "The one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God is blessed!"
42Lk 14:16 Then He told him: "A man was giving a large banquet and invited many.
42Lk 14:17 At the time of the banquet, he sent his slave to tell those who were invited, 'Come, because everything is now ready.'
42Lk 14:18 "But without exception they all began to make excuses. The first one said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to excuse me.'
42Lk 14:19 "Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm going to try them out. I ask you to excuse me.'
42Lk 14:20 "And another said, 'I just got married, and therefore I'm unable to come.'
42Lk 14:21 "So the slave came back and reported these things to his master. Then in anger, the master of the house told his slave, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in here the poor, maimed, blind, and lame!'
42Lk 14:22 " 'Master,' the slave said, 'what you ordered has been done, and there's still room.'
42Lk 14:23 "Then the master told the slave, 'Go out into the highways and lanes and make them come in, so that my house may be filled.
42Lk 14:24 For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will enjoy my banquet!'"
42Lk 14:25 Now great crowds were traveling with Him. So He turned and said to them:
42Lk 14:26 "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters-- yes, and even his own life-- he cannot be My disciple.
42Lk 14:27 Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
42Lk 14:28 "For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?
42Lk 14:29 Otherwise, after he has laid the foundation and cannot finish it, all the onlookers will begin to make fun of him,
42Lk 14:30 saying, 'This man started to build and wasn't able to finish.'
42Lk 14:31 "Or what king, going to war against another king, will not first sit down and decide if he is able with 10,000 to oppose the one who comes against him with 20,000?
42Lk 14:32 If not, while the other is still far off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
42Lk 14:33 In the same way, therefore, every one of you who does not say good-bye to all his possessions cannot be My disciple.
42Lk 14:34 "Now, salt is good, but if salt should lose its taste, how will it be made salty?
42Lk 14:35 It isn't fit for the soil or for the manure pile; they throw it out. Anyone who has ears to hear should listen!"
42Lk 15:1 All the tax collectors and sinners were approaching to listen to Him.
42Lk 15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them!"
42Lk 15:3 So He told them this parable:
42Lk 15:4 "What man among you, who has 100 sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the 99 in the open field and go after the lost one until he finds it?
42Lk 15:5 When he has found it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders,
42Lk 15:6 and coming home, he calls his friends and neighbors together, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my lost sheep!'
42Lk 15:7 I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous people who don't need repentance.
42Lk 15:8 "Or what woman who has 10 silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
42Lk 15:9 When she finds it, she calls her women friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found the silver coin I lost!'
42Lk 15:10 I tell you, in the same way, there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents."
42Lk 15:11 He also said: "A man had two sons.
42Lk 15:12 The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate I have coming to me.' So he distributed the assets to them.
42Lk 15:13 Not many days later, the younger son gathered together all he had and traveled to a distant country, where he squandered his estate in foolish living.
42Lk 15:14 After he had spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he had nothing.
42Lk 15:15 Then he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
42Lk 15:16 He longed to eat his fill from the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him any.
42Lk 15:17 When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired hands have more than enough food, and here I am dying of hunger!
42Lk 15:18 I'll get up, go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
42Lk 15:19 I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired hands.'
42Lk 15:20 So he got up and went to his father. But while the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him.
42Lk 15:21 The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.'
42Lk 15:22 "But the father told his slaves, 'Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42Lk 15:23 Then bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let's celebrate with a feast,
42Lk 15:24 because this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!' So they began to celebrate.
42Lk 15:25 "Now his older son was in the field; as he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
42Lk 15:26 So he summoned one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
42Lk 15:27 'Your brother is here,' he told him, 'and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'
42Lk 15:28 "Then he became angry and didn't want to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.
42Lk 15:29 But he replied to his father, 'Look, I have been slaving many years for you, and I have never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
42Lk 15:30 But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.'
42Lk 15:31 " 'Son,' he said to him, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42Lk 15:32 But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"
42Lk 16:1 He also said to the disciples: "There was a rich man who received an accusation that his manager was squandering his possessions.
42Lk 16:2 So he called the manager in and asked, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can no longer be [my] manager.'
42Lk 16:3 "Then the manager said to himself, 'What should I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I'm not strong enough to dig; I'm ashamed to beg.
42Lk 16:4 I know what I'll do so that when I'm removed from management, people will welcome me into their homes.'
42Lk 16:5 "So he summoned each one of his master's debtors. 'How much do you owe my master?' he asked the first one.
42Lk 16:6 " 'A hundred measures of oil,' he said. " 'Take your invoice,' he told him, 'sit down quickly, and write 50.'
42Lk 16:7 "Next he asked another, 'How much do you owe?' " 'A hundred measures of wheat,' he said. " 'Take your invoice,' he told him, 'and write 80.'
42Lk 16:8 "The master praised the unrighteous manager because he had acted astutely. For the sons of this age are more astute than the sons of light [in dealing] with their own people.
42Lk 16:9 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous money so that when it fails, they may welcome you into eternal dwellings.
42Lk 16:10 Whoever is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and whoever is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.
42Lk 16:11 So if you have not been faithful with the unrighteous money, who will trust you with what is genuine?
42Lk 16:12 And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what is your own?
42Lk 16:13 No household slave can be the slave of two masters, since either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't be slaves to both God and money."
42Lk 16:14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and scoffing at Him.
42Lk 16:15 And He told them: "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly admired by people is revolting in God's sight.
42Lk 16:16 "The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is strongly urged to enter it.
42Lk 16:17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the law to drop out.
42Lk 16:18 "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and everyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.
42Lk 16:19 "There was a rich man who would dress in purple and fine linen, feasting lavishly every day.
42Lk 16:20 But a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, was left at his gate.
42Lk 16:21 He longed to be filled with what fell from the rich man's table, but instead the dogs would come and lick his sores.
42Lk 16:22 One day the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42Lk 16:23 And being in torment in Hades, he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off, with Lazarus at his side.
42Lk 16:24 'Father Abraham!' he called out, 'Have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this flame!'
42Lk 16:25 " 'Son,' Abraham said, 'remember that during your life you received your good things, just as Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here, while you are in agony.
42Lk 16:26 Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who want to pass over from here to you cannot; neither can those from there cross over to us.'
42Lk 16:27 " 'Father,' he said, 'then I beg you to send him to my father's house--
42Lk 16:28 because I have five brothers-- to warn them, so they won't also come to this place of torment.'
42Lk 16:29 "But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.'
42Lk 16:30 " 'No, father Abraham,' he said. 'But if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'
42Lk 16:31 "But he told him, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.'"
42Lk 17:1 He said to His disciples, "Offenses will certainly come, but woe to the one they come through!
42Lk 17:2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
42Lk 17:3 Be on your guard. If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
42Lk 17:4 And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and comes back to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him."
42Lk 17:5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
42Lk 17:6 "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed," the Lord said, "you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.
42Lk 17:7 "Which one of you having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?
42Lk 17:8 Instead, will he not tell him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, get ready, and serve me while I eat and drink; later you can eat and drink'?
42Lk 17:9 Does he thank that slave because he did what was commanded?
42Lk 17:10 In the same way, when you have done all that you were commanded, you should say, 'We are good-for-nothing slaves; we've only done our duty.'"
42Lk 17:11 While traveling to Jerusalem, He passed between Samaria and Galilee.
42Lk 17:12 As He entered a village, 10 men with serious skin diseases met Him. They stood at a distance
42Lk 17:13 and raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42Lk 17:14 When He saw them, He told them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And while they were going, they were healed.
42Lk 17:15 But one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned and, with a loud voice, gave glory to God.
42Lk 17:16 He fell facedown at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.
42Lk 17:17 Then Jesus said, "Were not 10 cleansed? Where are the nine?
42Lk 17:18 Didn't any return to give glory to God except this foreigner?"
42Lk 17:19 And He told him, "Get up and go on your way. Your faith has made you well."
42Lk 17:20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God will come, He answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with something observable;
42Lk 17:21 no one will say, 'Look here!' or 'There!' For you see, the kingdom of God is among you."
42Lk 17:22 Then He told the disciples: "The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you won't see it.
42Lk 17:23 They will say to you, 'Look there!' or 'Look here!' Don't follow or run after them.
42Lk 17:24 For as the lightning flashes from horizon to horizon and lights up the sky, so the Son of Man will be in His day.
42Lk 17:25 But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42Lk 17:26 "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man:
42Lk 17:27 people went on eating, drinking, marrying and giving in marriage until the day Noah boarded the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:28 It will be the same as it was in the days of Lot: people went on eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building.
42Lk 17:29 But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:30 It will be like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
42Lk 17:31 On that day, a man on the housetop, whose belongings are in the house, must not come down to get them. Likewise the man who is in the field must not turn back.
42Lk 17:32 Remember Lot's wife!
42Lk 17:33 Whoever tries to make his life secure will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.
42Lk 17:34 I tell you, on that night two will be in one bed: one will be taken and the other will be left.
42Lk 17:35 Two women will be grinding grain together: one will be taken and the other left.
42Lk 17:36 [[Two will be in a field: one will be taken, and the other will be left."]]
42Lk 17:37 "Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered."
42Lk 18:1 He then told them a parable on the need for them to pray always and not become discouraged:
42Lk 18:2 "There was a judge in one town who didn't fear God or respect man.
42Lk 18:3 And a widow in that town kept coming to him, saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.'
42Lk 18:4 "For a while he was unwilling, but later he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or respect man,
42Lk 18:5 yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice, so she doesn't wear me out by her persistent coming.'"
42Lk 18:6 Then the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
42Lk 18:7 Will not God grant justice to His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He delay [to help] them?
42Lk 18:8 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth?"
42Lk 18:9 He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else:
42Lk 18:10 "Two men went up to the temple complex to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
42Lk 18:11 The Pharisee took his stand and was praying like this: 'God, I thank You that I'm not like other people-- greedy, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
42Lk 18:12 I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get.'
42Lk 18:13 "But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even raise his eyes to heaven but kept striking his chest and saying, 'God, turn Your wrath from me-- a sinner!'
42Lk 18:14 I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the other; because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
42Lk 18:15 Some people were even bringing infants to Him so He might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
42Lk 18:16 Jesus, however, invited them: "Let the little children come to Me, and don't stop them, because the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42Lk 18:17 I assure you: Whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
42Lk 18:18 A ruler asked Him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 18:19 "Why do you call Me good?" Jesus asked him. "No one is good but One-- God.
42Lk 18:20 You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; honor your father and mother."
42Lk 18:21 "I have kept all these from my youth," he said.
42Lk 18:22 When Jesus heard this, He told him, "You still lack one thing: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me."
42Lk 18:23 After he heard this, he became extremely sad, because he was very rich.
42Lk 18:24 Seeing that he became sad, Jesus said, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!
42Lk 18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
42Lk 18:26 Those who heard this asked, "Then who can be saved?"
42Lk 18:27 He replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."
42Lk 18:28 Then Peter said, "Look, we have left what we had and followed You."
42Lk 18:29 So He said to them, "I assure you: There is no one who has left a house, wife or brothers, parents or children because of the kingdom of God,
42Lk 18:30 who will not receive many times more at this time, and eternal life in the age to come."
42Lk 18:31 Then He took the Twelve aside and told them, "Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem. Everything that is written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
42Lk 18:32 For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and He will be mocked, insulted, spit on;
42Lk 18:33 and after they flog Him, they will kill Him, and He will rise on the third day."
42Lk 18:34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
42Lk 18:35 As He drew near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging.
42Lk 18:36 Hearing a crowd passing by, he inquired what this meant.
42Lk 18:37 "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by," they told him.
42Lk 18:38 So he called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:39 Then those in front told him to keep quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:40 Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him. When he drew near, He asked him,
42Lk 18:41 "What do you want Me to do for you?" "Lord," he said, "I want to see!"
42Lk 18:42 "Receive your sight!" Jesus told him. "Your faith has healed you."
42Lk 18:43 Instantly he could see, and he began to follow Him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
42Lk 19:1 He entered Jericho and was passing through.
42Lk 19:2 There was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
42Lk 19:3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he was not able because of the crowd, since he was a short man.
42Lk 19:4 So running ahead, he climbed up a sycamore tree to see Jesus, since He was about to pass that way.
42Lk 19:5 When Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, because today I must stay at your house."
42Lk 19:6 So he quickly came down and welcomed Him joyfully.
42Lk 19:7 All who saw it began to complain, "He's gone to lodge with a sinful man!"
42Lk 19:8 But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, "Look, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor, Lord! And if I have extorted anything from anyone, I'll pay back four times as much!"
42Lk 19:9 "Today salvation has come to this house," Jesus told him, "because he too is a son of Abraham.
42Lk 19:10 For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost."
42Lk 19:11 As they were listening to this, He went on to tell a parable because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought the kingdom of God was going to appear right away.
42Lk 19:12 Therefore He said: "A nobleman traveled to a far country to receive for himself authority to be king and then return.
42Lk 19:13 He called 10 of his slaves, gave them 10 minas, and told them, 'Engage in business until I come back.'
42Lk 19:14 "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We don't want this man to rule over us!'
42Lk 19:15 "At his return, having received the authority to be king, he summoned those slaves he had given the money to so he could find out how much they had made in business.
42Lk 19:16 The first came forward and said, 'Master, your mina has earned 10 more minas.'
42Lk 19:17 " 'Well done, good slave!' he told him. 'Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, have authority over 10 towns.'
42Lk 19:18 "The second came and said, 'Master, your mina has made five minas.'
42Lk 19:19 "So he said to him, 'You will be over five towns.'
42Lk 19:20 "And another came and said, 'Master, here is your mina. I have kept it hidden away in a cloth
42Lk 19:21 because I was afraid of you, for you're a tough man: you collect what you didn't deposit and reap what you didn't sow.'
42Lk 19:22 "He told him, 'I will judge you by what you have said, you evil slave! [If] you knew I was a tough man, collecting what I didn't deposit and reaping what I didn't sow,
42Lk 19:23 why didn't you put my money in the bank? And when I returned, I would have collected it with interest!'
42Lk 19:24 So he said to those standing there, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has 10 minas.'
42Lk 19:25 "But they said to him, 'Master, he has 10 minas.'
42Lk 19:26 " 'I tell you, that to everyone who has, more will be given; and from the one who does not have, even what he does have will be taken away.
42Lk 19:27 But bring here these enemies of mine, who did not want me to rule over them, and slaughter them in my presence.'"
42Lk 19:28 When He had said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
42Lk 19:29 As He approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, He sent two of the disciples
42Lk 19:30 and said, "Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a young donkey tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
42Lk 19:31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say this: 'The Lord needs it.'"
42Lk 19:32 So those who were sent left and found it just as He had told them.
42Lk 19:33 As they were untying the young donkey, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the donkey?"
42Lk 19:34 "The Lord needs it," they said.
42Lk 19:35 Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their robes on the donkey, they helped Jesus get on it.
42Lk 19:36 As He was going along, they were spreading their robes on the road.
42Lk 19:37 Now He came near the path down the Mount of Olives, and the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen:
42Lk 19:38 Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord. Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heaven!
42Lk 19:39 Some of the Pharisees from the crowd told Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."
42Lk 19:40 He answered, "I tell you, if they were to keep silent, the stones would cry out!"
42Lk 19:41 As He approached and saw the city, He wept over it,
42Lk 19:42 saying, "If you knew this day what [would bring] peace-- but now it is hidden from your eyes.
42Lk 19:43 For the days will come on you when your enemies will build an embankment against you, surround you, and hem you in on every side.
42Lk 19:44 They will crush you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave one stone on another in you, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
42Lk 19:45 He went into the temple complex and began to throw out those who were selling,
42Lk 19:46 and He said, "It is written, My house will be a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!"
42Lk 19:47 Every day He was teaching in the temple complex. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were looking for a way to destroy Him,
42Lk 19:48 but they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were captivated by what they heard.
42Lk 20:1 One day as He was teaching the people in the temple complex and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came up
42Lk 20:2 and said to Him: "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Who is it who gave You this authority?"
42Lk 20:3 He answered them, "I will also ask you a question. Tell Me,
42Lk 20:4 was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"
42Lk 20:5 They discussed it among themselves: "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
42Lk 20:6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet."
42Lk 20:7 So they answered that they did not know its origin.
42Lk 20:8 And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
42Lk 20:9 Then He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went away for a long time.
42Lk 20:10 At harvest time he sent a slave to the farmers so that they might give him some fruit from the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
42Lk 20:11 He sent yet another slave, but they beat that one too, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
42Lk 20:12 And he sent yet a third, but they wounded this one too and threw him out.
42Lk 20:13 "Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.'
42Lk 20:14 "But when the tenant farmers saw him, they discussed it among themselves and said, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him, so the inheritance will be ours!'
42Lk 20:15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42Lk 20:16 He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others." But when they heard this they said, "No-- never!"
42Lk 20:17 But He looked at them and said, "Then what is the meaning of this Scripture: The stone that the builders rejected-- this has become the cornerstone?
42Lk 20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and if it falls on anyone, it will grind him to powder!"
42Lk 20:19 Then the scribes and the chief priests looked for a way to get their hands on Him that very hour, because they knew He had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.
42Lk 20:20 They watched closely and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, so they could catch Him in what He said, to hand Him over to the governor's rule and authority.
42Lk 20:21 They questioned Him, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You don't show partiality, but teach truthfully the way of God.
42Lk 20:22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42Lk 20:23 But detecting their craftiness, He said to them,
42Lk 20:24 "Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?" "Caesar's," they said.
42Lk 20:25 "Well then," He told them, "give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's."
42Lk 20:26 They were not able to catch Him in what He said in public, and being amazed at His answer, they became silent.
42Lk 20:27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came up and questioned Him:
42Lk 20:28 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother has a wife, and dies childless, his brother should take the wife and produce offspring for his brother.
42Lk 20:29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died without children.
42Lk 20:30 Also the second
42Lk 20:31 and the third took her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children.
42Lk 20:32 Finally, the woman died too.
42Lk 20:33 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had married her."
42Lk 20:34 Jesus told them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.
42Lk 20:35 But those who are counted worthy to take part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
42Lk 20:36 For they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection.
42Lk 20:37 Moses even indicated [in the passage] about the burning bush that the dead are raised, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
42Lk 20:38 He is not God of the dead but of the living, because all are living to Him."
42Lk 20:39 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, You have spoken well."
42Lk 20:40 And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.
42Lk 20:41 Then He said to them, "How can they say that the Messiah is the Son of David?
42Lk 20:42 For David himself says in the Book of Psalms: The Lord declared to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand
42Lk 20:43 until I make Your enemies Your footstool.'
42Lk 20:44 David calls Him 'Lord'; how then can the Messiah be his Son?"
42Lk 20:45 While all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,
42Lk 20:46 "Beware of the scribes, who want to go around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces, the front seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
42Lk 20:47 They devour widows' houses and say long prayers just for show. These will receive greater punishment."
42Lk 21:1 He looked up and saw the rich dropping their offerings into the temple treasury.
42Lk 21:2 He also saw a poor widow dropping in two tiny coins.
42Lk 21:3 "I tell you the truth," He said. "This poor widow has put in more than all of them.
42Lk 21:4 For all these people have put in gifts out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on."
42Lk 21:5 As some were talking about the temple complex, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, He said,
42Lk 21:6 "These things that you see-- the days will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be thrown down!"
42Lk 21:7 "Teacher," they asked Him, "so when will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?"
42Lk 21:8 Then He said, "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time is near.' Don't follow them.
42Lk 21:9 When you hear of wars and rebellions, don't be alarmed. Indeed, these things must take place first, but the end won't come right away."
42Lk 21:10 Then He told them: "Nation will be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42Lk 21:11 There will be violent earthquakes, and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be terrifying sights and great signs from heaven.
42Lk 21:12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you. They will hand you over to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of My name.
42Lk 21:13 It will lead to an opportunity for you to witness.
42Lk 21:14 Therefore make up your minds not to prepare your defense ahead of time,
42Lk 21:15 for I will give you such words and a wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
42Lk 21:16 You will even be betrayed by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will kill some of you.
42Lk 21:17 You will be hated by everyone because of My name,
42Lk 21:18 but not a hair of your head will be lost.
42Lk 21:19 By your endurance gain your lives.
42Lk 21:20 "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that its desolation has come near.
42Lk 21:21 Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains! Those inside the city must leave it, and those who are in the country must not enter it,
42Lk 21:22 because these are days of vengeance to fulfill all the things that are written.
42Lk 21:23 Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days, for there will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42Lk 21:24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
42Lk 21:25 "Then there will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and there will be anguish on the earth among nations bewildered by the roaring sea and waves.
42Lk 21:26 People will faint from fear and expectation of the things that are coming on the world, because the celestial powers will be shaken.
42Lk 21:27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
42Lk 21:28 But when these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near!"
42Lk 21:29 Then He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
42Lk 21:30 As soon as they put out [leaves] you can see for yourselves and recognize that summer is already near.
42Lk 21:31 In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near.
42Lk 21:32 I assure you: This generation will certainly not pass away until all things take place.
42Lk 21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.
42Lk 21:34 "Be on your guard, so that your minds are not dulled from carousing, drunkenness, and worries of life, or that day will come on you unexpectedly
42Lk 21:35 like a trap. For it will come on all who live on the face of the whole earth.
42Lk 21:36 But be alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place and to stand before the Son of Man."
42Lk 21:37 During the day, He was teaching in the temple complex, but in the evening He would go out and spend the night on what is called the Mount of Olives.
42Lk 21:38 Then all the people would come early in the morning to hear Him in the temple complex.
42Lk 22:1 The Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was drawing near.
42Lk 22:2 The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put Him to death, because they were afraid of the people.
42Lk 22:3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered among the Twelve.
42Lk 22:4 He went away and discussed with the chief priests and temple police how he could hand Him over to them.
42Lk 22:5 They were glad and agreed to give him silver.
42Lk 22:6 So he accepted [the offer] and started looking for a good opportunity to betray Him to them when the crowd was not present.
42Lk 22:7 Then the Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
42Lk 22:8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us, so we can eat it."
42Lk 22:9 "Where do You want us to prepare it?" they asked Him.
42Lk 22:10 "Listen," He said to them, "when you've entered the city, a man carrying a water jug will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters.
42Lk 22:11 Tell the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks you, "Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
42Lk 22:12 Then he will show you a large, furnished room upstairs. Make the preparations there."
42Lk 22:13 So they went and found it just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
42Lk 22:14 When the hour came, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him.
42Lk 22:15 Then He said to them, "I have fervently desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
42Lk 22:16 For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
42Lk 22:17 Then He took a cup, and after giving thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.
42Lk 22:18 For I tell you, from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
42Lk 22:19 And He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said, "This is My body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of Me."
42Lk 22:20 In the same way He also took the cup after supper and said, "This cup is the new covenant [established by] My blood; it is shed for you.
42Lk 22:21 But look, the hand of the one betraying Me is at the table with Me!
42Lk 22:22 For the Son of Man will go away as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"
42Lk 22:23 So they began to argue among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this thing.
42Lk 22:24 Then a dispute also arose among them about who should be considered the greatest.
42Lk 22:25 But He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles dominate them, and those who have authority over them are called 'Benefactors.'
42Lk 22:26 But it must not be like that among you. On the contrary, whoever is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and whoever leads, like the one serving.
42Lk 22:27 For who is greater, the one at the table or the one serving? Isn't it the one at the table? But I am among you as the One who serves.
42Lk 22:28 You are the ones who stood by Me in My trials.
42Lk 22:29 I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one on Me,
42Lk 22:30 so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom. And you will sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel.
42Lk 22:31 "Simon, Simon, look out! Satan has asked to sift you like wheat.
42Lk 22:32 But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
42Lk 22:33 "Lord," he told Him, "I'm ready to go with You both to prison and to death!"
42Lk 22:34 "I tell you, Peter," He said, "the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me!"
42Lk 22:35 He also said to them, "When I sent you out without money-bag, traveling bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Not a thing," they said.
42Lk 22:36 Then He said to them, "But now, whoever has a money-bag should take it, and also a traveling bag. And whoever doesn't have a sword should sell his robe and buy one.
42Lk 22:37 For I tell you, what is written must be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted among the outlaws. Yes, what is written about Me is coming to its fulfillment."
42Lk 22:38 "Lord," they said, "look, here are two swords." "Enough of that!" He told them.
42Lk 22:39 He went out and made His way as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.
42Lk 22:40 When He reached the place, He told them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
42Lk 22:41 Then He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,
42Lk 22:42 "Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from Me-- nevertheless, not My will, but Yours, be done."
42Lk 22:43 [[Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
42Lk 22:44 Being in anguish, He prayed more fervently, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.]]
42Lk 22:45 When He got up from prayer and came to the disciples, He found them sleeping, exhausted from their grief.
42Lk 22:46 "Why are you sleeping?" He asked them. "Get up and pray, so that you won't enter into temptation."
42Lk 22:47 While He was still speaking, suddenly a mob was there, and one of the Twelve named Judas was leading them. He came near Jesus to kiss Him,
42Lk 22:48 but Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42Lk 22:49 When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they asked, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?"
42Lk 22:50 Then one of them struck the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear.
42Lk 22:51 But Jesus responded, "No more of this!" And touching his ear, He healed him.
42Lk 22:52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple police, and the elders who had come for Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a criminal?
42Lk 22:53 Every day while I was with you in the temple complex, you never laid a hand on Me. But this is your hour-- and the dominion of darkness."
42Lk 22:54 They seized Him, led Him away, and brought Him into the high priest's house. Meanwhile Peter was following at a distance.
42Lk 22:55 They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, and Peter sat among them.
42Lk 22:56 When a servant saw him sitting in the firelight, and looked closely at him, she said, "This man was with Him too."
42Lk 22:57 But he denied it: "Woman, I don't know Him!"
42Lk 22:58 After a little while, someone else saw him and said, "You're one of them too!" "Man, I am not!" Peter said.
42Lk 22:59 About an hour later, another kept insisting, "This man was certainly with Him, since he's also a Galilean."
42Lk 22:60 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
42Lk 22:61 Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. So Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, "Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times."
42Lk 22:62 And he went outside and wept bitterly.
42Lk 22:63 The men who were holding Jesus started mocking and beating Him.
42Lk 22:64 After blindfolding Him, they kept asking, "Prophesy! Who hit You?"
42Lk 22:65 And they were saying many other blasphemous things against Him.
42Lk 22:66 When daylight came, the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the scribes, convened and brought Him before their Sanhedrin.
42Lk 22:67 They said, "If You are the Messiah, tell us." But He said to them, "If I do tell you, you will not believe.
42Lk 22:68 And if I ask you, you will not answer.
42Lk 22:69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the Power of God."
42Lk 22:70 They all asked, "Are You, then, the Son of God?" And He said to them, "You say that I am."
42Lk 22:71 "Why do we need any more testimony," they said, "since we've heard it ourselves from His mouth?"
42Lk 23:1 Then their whole assembly rose up and brought Him before Pilate.
42Lk 23:2 They began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man subverting our nation, opposing payment of taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is the Messiah, a King."
42Lk 23:3 So Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "You have said it."
42Lk 23:4 Pilate then told the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no grounds for charging this man."
42Lk 23:5 But they kept insisting, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where He started even to here."
42Lk 23:6 When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
42Lk 23:7 Finding that He was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.
42Lk 23:8 Herod was very glad to see Jesus; for a long time he had wanted to see Him, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see some miracle performed by Him.
42Lk 23:9 So he kept asking Him questions, but Jesus did not answer him.
42Lk 23:10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.
42Lk 23:11 Then Herod, with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt, mocked Him, dressed Him in a brilliant robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
42Lk 23:12 That very day Herod and Pilate became friends. Previously, they had been hostile toward each other.
42Lk 23:13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people,
42Lk 23:14 and said to them, "You have brought me this man as one who subverts the people. But in fact, after examining Him in your presence, I have found no grounds to charge this man with those things you accuse Him of.
42Lk 23:15 Neither has Herod, because he sent Him back to us. Clearly, He has done nothing to deserve death.
42Lk 23:16 Therefore I will have Him whipped and [then] release Him."
42Lk 23:17 [[For according to the festival he had to release someone to them.]]
42Lk 23:18 Then they all cried out together, "Take this man away! Release Barabbas to us!"
42Lk 23:19 (He had been thrown into prison for a rebellion that had taken place in the city, and for murder.)
42Lk 23:20 Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,
42Lk 23:21 but they kept shouting, "Crucify! Crucify Him!"
42Lk 23:22 A third time he said to them, "Why? What has this man done wrong? I have found in Him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have Him whipped and [then] release Him."
42Lk 23:23 But they kept up the pressure, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices won out.
42Lk 23:24 So Pilate decided to grant their demand
42Lk 23:25 and released the one they were asking for, who had been thrown into prison for rebellion and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.
42Lk 23:26 As they led Him away, they seized Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
42Lk 23:27 A great multitude of the people followed Him, including women who were mourning and lamenting Him.
42Lk 23:28 But turning to them, Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and your children.
42Lk 23:29 Look, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!'
42Lk 23:30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'
42Lk 23:31 For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
42Lk 23:32 Two others-- criminals-- were also led away to be executed with Him.
42Lk 23:33 When they arrived at the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.
42Lk 23:34 [[Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing."]] And they divided His clothes and cast lots.
42Lk 23:35 The people stood watching, and even the leaders kept scoffing: "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is God's Messiah, the Chosen One!"
42Lk 23:36 The soldiers also mocked Him. They came offering Him sour wine
42Lk 23:37 and said, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
42Lk 23:38 An inscription was above Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
42Lk 23:39 Then one of the criminals hanging there began to yell insults at Him: "Aren't You the Messiah? Save Yourself and us!"
42Lk 23:40 But the other answered, rebuking him: "Don't you even fear God, since you are undergoing the same punishment?
42Lk 23:41 We are punished justly, because we're getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong."
42Lk 23:42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!"
42Lk 23:43 And He said to him, "I assure you: Today you will be with Me in paradise."
42Lk 23:44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three,
42Lk 23:45 because the sun's light failed. The curtain of the sanctuary was split down the middle.
42Lk 23:46 And Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into Your hands I entrust My spirit. " Saying this, He breathed His last.
42Lk 23:47 When the centurion saw what happened, he began to glorify God, saying, "This man really was righteous!"
42Lk 23:48 All the crowds that had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, went home, striking their chests.
42Lk 23:49 But all who knew Him, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
42Lk 23:50 There was a good and righteous man named Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin,
42Lk 23:51 who had not agreed with their plan and action. He was from Arimathea, a Judean town, and was looking forward to the kingdom of God.
42Lk 23:52 He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
42Lk 23:53 Taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever been placed.
42Lk 23:54 It was preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42Lk 23:55 The women who had come with Him from Galilee followed along and observed the tomb and how His body was placed.
42Lk 23:56 Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
42Lk 24:1 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
42Lk 24:2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
42Lk 24:3 They went in but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42Lk 24:4 While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood by them in dazzling clothes.
42Lk 24:5 So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground. "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?" asked the men.
42Lk 24:6 "He is not here, but He has been resurrected! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,
42Lk 24:7 saying, 'The Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day'?"
42Lk 24:8 And they remembered His words.
42Lk 24:9 Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest.
42Lk 24:10 Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them were telling the apostles these things.
42Lk 24:11 But these words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
42Lk 24:12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. When he stooped to look in, he saw only the linen cloths. So he went home, amazed at what had happened.
42Lk 24:13 Now that same day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:14 Together they were discussing everything that had taken place.
42Lk 24:15 And while they were discussing and arguing, Jesus Himself came near and began to walk along with them.
42Lk 24:16 But they were prevented from recognizing Him.
42Lk 24:17 Then He asked them, "What is this dispute that you're having with each other as you are walking?" And they stopped [walking and looked] discouraged.
42Lk 24:18 The one named Cleopas answered Him, "Are You the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things that happened there in these days?"
42Lk 24:19 "What things?" He asked them. So they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in action and speech before God and all the people,
42Lk 24:20 and how our chief priests and leaders handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified Him.
42Lk 24:21 But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. Besides all this, it's the third day since these things happened.
42Lk 24:22 Moreover, some women from our group astounded us. They arrived early at the tomb,
42Lk 24:23 and when they didn't find His body, they came and reported that they had seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.
42Lk 24:24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see Him."
42Lk 24:25 He said to them, "How unwise and slow you are to believe in your hearts all that the prophets have spoken!
42Lk 24:26 Didn't the Messiah have to suffer these things and enter into His glory?"
42Lk 24:27 Then beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He interpreted for them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:28 They came near the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther.
42Lk 24:29 But they urged Him: "Stay with us, because it's almost evening, and now the day is almost over." So He went in to stay with them.
42Lk 24:30 It was as He reclined at the table with them that He took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.
42Lk 24:31 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him, but He disappeared from their sight.
42Lk 24:32 So they said to each other, "Weren't our hearts ablaze within us while He was talking with us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us?"
42Lk 24:33 That very hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the Eleven and those with them gathered together,
42Lk 24:34 who said, "The Lord has certainly been raised, and has appeared to Simon!"
42Lk 24:35 Then they began to describe what had happened on the road and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
42Lk 24:36 And as they were saying these things, He Himself stood among them. He said to them, "Peace to you!"
42Lk 24:37 But they were startled and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost.
42Lk 24:38 "Why are you troubled?" He asked them. "And why do doubts arise in your hearts?
42Lk 24:39 Look at My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself! Touch Me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have."
42Lk 24:40 Having said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
42Lk 24:41 But while they still could not believe because of [their] joy and were amazed, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42Lk 24:42 So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish,
42Lk 24:43 and He took it and ate in their presence.
42Lk 24:44 Then He told them, "These are My words that I spoke to you while I was still with you-- that everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
42Lk 24:45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:46 He also said to them, "This is what is written: the Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead the third day,
42Lk 24:47 and repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:48 You are witnesses of these things.
42Lk 24:49 And look, I am sending you what My Father promised. As for you, stay in the city until you are empowered from on high."
42Lk 24:50 Then He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands He blessed them.
42Lk 24:51 And while He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.
42Lk 24:52 After worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
42Lk 24:53 And they were continually in the temple complex blessing God.

43Jn 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43Jn 1:2 He was with God in the beginning.
43Jn 1:3 All things were created through Him, and apart from Him not one thing was created that has been created.
43Jn 1:4 Life was in Him, and that life was the light of men.
43Jn 1:5 That light shines in the darkness, yet the darkness did not overcome it.
43Jn 1:6 There was a man named John who was sent from God.
43Jn 1:7 He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.
43Jn 1:8 He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.
43Jn 1:9 The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
43Jn 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was created through Him, yet the world did not recognize Him.
43Jn 1:11 He came to His own, and His own people did not receive Him.
43Jn 1:12 But to all who did receive Him, He gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in His name,
43Jn 1:13 who were born, not of blood, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.
43Jn 1:14 The Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We observed His glory, the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43Jn 1:15 (John testified concerning Him and exclaimed, "This was the One of whom I said, 'The One coming after me has surpassed me, because He existed before me.' ")
43Jn 1:16 Indeed, we have all received grace after grace from His fullness,
43Jn 1:17 for although the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
43Jn 1:18 No one has ever seen God. The One and Only Son-- the One who is at the Father's side-- He has revealed Him.
43Jn 1:19 This is John's testimony when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"
43Jn 1:20 He did not refuse to answer, but he declared: "I am not the Messiah."
43Jn 1:21 "What then?" they asked him. "Are you Elijah?" "I am not," he said. "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he answered.
43Jn 1:22 "Who are you, then?" they asked. "We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What can you tell us about yourself?"
43Jn 1:23 He said, "I am a voice of one crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord-- just as Isaiah the prophet said."
43Jn 1:24 Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
43Jn 1:25 So they asked him, "Why then do you baptize if you aren't the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?"
43Jn 1:26 "I baptize with water," John answered them. "Someone stands among you, but you don't know [Him].
43Jn 1:27 He is the One coming after me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to untie."
43Jn 1:28 All this happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43Jn 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43Jn 1:30 This is the One I told you about: 'After me comes a man who has surpassed me, because He existed before me.'
43Jn 1:31 I didn't know Him, but I came baptizing with water so He might be revealed to Israel."
43Jn 1:32 And John testified, "I watched the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He rested on Him.
43Jn 1:33 I didn't know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The One you see the Spirit descending and resting on-- He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
43Jn 1:34 I have seen and testified that He is the Son of God!"
43Jn 1:35 Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
43Jn 1:36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look! The Lamb of God!"
43Jn 1:37 The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:38 When Jesus turned and noticed them following Him, He asked them, "What are you looking for?" They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are You staying?"
43Jn 1:39 "Come and you'll see," He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about 10 in the morning.
43Jn 1:40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Him.
43Jn 1:41 He first found his own brother Simon and told him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which means "Anointed One"),
43Jn 1:42 and he brought [Simon] to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, He said, "You are Simon, son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which means "Rock").
43Jn 1:43 The next day He decided to leave for Galilee. Jesus found Philip and told him, "Follow Me!"
43Jn 1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.
43Jn 1:45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the One Moses wrote about in the law (and so did the prophets): Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth!"
43Jn 1:46 "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Nathanael asked him. "Come and see," Philip answered.
43Jn 1:47 Then Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said about him, "Here is a true Israelite; no deceit is in him."
43Jn 1:48 "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you," Jesus answered.
43Jn 1:49 "Rabbi," Nathanael replied, "You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
43Jn 1:50 Jesus responded to him, "Do you believe [only] because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this."
43Jn 1:51 Then He said, "I assure you: You will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43Jn 2:1 On the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, and
43Jn 2:2 Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding as well.
43Jn 2:3 When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother told Him, "They don't have any wine."
43Jn 2:4 "What has this concern of yours to do with Me, woman?" Jesus asked. "My hour has not yet come."
43Jn 2:5 "Do whatever He tells you," His mother told the servants.
43Jn 2:6 Now six stone water jars had been set there for Jewish purification. Each contained 20 or 30 gallons.
43Jn 2:7 "Fill the jars with water," Jesus told them. So they filled them to the brim.
43Jn 2:8 Then He said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the chief servant." And they did.
43Jn 2:9 When the chief servant tasted the water (after it had become wine), he did not know where it came from-- though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the groom
43Jn 2:10 and told him, "Everybody sets out the fine wine first, then, after people have drunk freely, the inferior. But you have kept the fine wine until now."
43Jn 2:11 Jesus performed this first sign in Cana of Galilee. He displayed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
43Jn 2:12 After this, He went down to Capernaum, together with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples, and they stayed there only a few days.
43Jn 2:13 The Jewish Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43Jn 2:14 In the temple complex He found people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and [He also found] the money changers sitting there.
43Jn 2:15 After making a whip out of cords, He drove everyone out of the temple complex with their sheep and oxen. He also poured out the money changers' coins and overturned the tables.
43Jn 2:16 He told those who were selling doves, "Get these things out of here! Stop turning My Father's house into a marketplace!"
43Jn 2:17 And His disciples remembered that it is written: Zeal for Your house will consume Me.
43Jn 2:18 So the Jews replied to Him, "What sign [of authority] will You show us for doing these things?"
43Jn 2:19 Jesus answered, "Destroy this sanctuary, and I will raise it up in three days."
43Jn 2:20 Therefore the Jews said, "This sanctuary took 46 years to build, and will You raise it up in three days?"
43Jn 2:21 But He was speaking about the sanctuary of His body.
43Jn 2:22 So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. And they believed the Scripture and the statement Jesus had made.
43Jn 2:23 While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many trusted in His name when they saw the signs He was doing.
43Jn 2:24 Jesus, however, would not entrust Himself to them, since He knew them all
43Jn 2:25 and because He did not need anyone to testify about man; for He Himself knew what was in man.
43Jn 3:1 There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
43Jn 3:2 This man came to Him at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one could perform these signs You do unless God were with him."
43Jn 3:3 Jesus replied, "I assure you: Unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
43Jn 3:4 "But how can anyone be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked Him. "Can he enter his mother's womb a second time and be born?"
43Jn 3:5 Jesus answered, "I assure you: Unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
43Jn 3:6 Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.
43Jn 3:7 Do not be amazed that I told you that you must be born again.
43Jn 3:8 The wind blows where it pleases, and you hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
43Jn 3:9 "How can these things be?" asked Nicodemus.
43Jn 3:10 "Are you a teacher of Israel and don't know these things?" Jesus replied.
43Jn 3:11 "I assure you: We speak what We know and We testify to what We have seen, but you do not accept Our testimony.
43Jn 3:12 If I have told you about things that happen on earth and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you about things of heaven?
43Jn 3:13 No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven-- the Son of Man.
43Jn 3:14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
43Jn 3:15 so that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life.
43Jn 3:16 "For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.
43Jn 3:17 For God did not send His Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
43Jn 3:18 Anyone who believes in Him is not judged, but anyone who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God.
43Jn 3:19 "This, then, is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
43Jn 3:20 For everyone who practices wicked things hates the light and avoids it, so that his deeds may not be exposed.
43Jn 3:21 But anyone who lives by the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God."
43Jn 3:22 After this, Jesus and His disciples went to the Judean countryside, where He spent time with them and baptized.
43Jn 3:23 John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People were coming and being baptized,
43Jn 3:24 since John had not yet been thrown into prison.
43Jn 3:25 Then a dispute arose between John's disciples and a Jew about purification.
43Jn 3:26 So they came to John and told him, "Rabbi, the One you testified about, and who was with you across the Jordan, is baptizing-- and everyone is flocking to Him."
43Jn 3:27 John responded, "No one can receive a single thing unless it's given to him from heaven.
43Jn 3:28 You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah, but I've been sent ahead of Him.'
43Jn 3:29 He who has the bride is the groom. But the groom's friend, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the groom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete.
43Jn 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease."
43Jn 3:31 The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth is earthly and speaks in earthly terms. The One who comes from heaven is above all.
43Jn 3:32 He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony.
43Jn 3:33 The one who has accepted His testimony has affirmed that God is true.
43Jn 3:34 For God sent Him, and He speaks God's words, since He gives the Spirit without measure.
43Jn 3:35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hands.
43Jn 3:36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who refuses to believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him.
43Jn 4:1 When Jesus knew that the Pharisees heard He was making and baptizing more disciples than John
43Jn 4:2 (though Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),
43Jn 4:3 He left Judea and went again to Galilee.
43Jn 4:4 He had to travel through Samaria,
43Jn 4:5 so He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar near the property that Jacob had given his son Joseph.
43Jn 4:6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, worn out from His journey, sat down at the well. It was about six in the evening.
43Jn 4:7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. "Give Me a drink," Jesus said to her,
43Jn 4:8 for His disciples had gone into town to buy food.
43Jn 4:9 "How is it that You, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" she asked Him. For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
43Jn 4:10 Jesus answered, "If you knew the gift of God, and who is saying to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would ask Him, and He would give you living water."
43Jn 4:11 "Sir," said the woman, "You don't even have a bucket, and the well is deep. So where do you get this 'living water'?
43Jn 4:12 You aren't greater than our father Jacob, are you? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and livestock."
43Jn 4:13 Jesus said, "Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again.
43Jn 4:14 But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again-- ever! In fact, the water I will give him will become a well of water springing up within him for eternal life."
43Jn 4:15 "Sir," the woman said to Him, "give me this water so I won't get thirsty and come here to draw water."
43Jn 4:16 "Go call your husband," He told her, "and come back here."
43Jn 4:17 "I don't have a husband," she answered. "You have correctly said, 'I don't have a husband,' " Jesus said.
43Jn 4:18 "For you've had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true."
43Jn 4:19 "Sir," the woman replied, "I see that You are a prophet.
43Jn 4:20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, yet you [Jews] say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem."
43Jn 4:21 Jesus told her, "Believe Me, woman, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
43Jn 4:22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews.
43Jn 4:23 But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. Yes, the Father wants such people to worship Him.
43Jn 4:24 God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."
43Jn 4:25 The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who is called Christ). "When He comes, He will explain everything to us."
43Jn 4:26 "I am [He]," Jesus told her, "the One speaking to you."
43Jn 4:27 Just then His disciples arrived, and they were amazed that He was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, "What do You want?" or "Why are You talking with her?"
43Jn 4:28 Then the woman left her water jar, went into town, and told the men,
43Jn 4:29 "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could this be the Messiah?"
43Jn 4:30 They left the town and made their way to Him.
43Jn 4:31 In the meantime the disciples kept urging Him, "Rabbi, eat something."
43Jn 4:32 But He said, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."
43Jn 4:33 The disciples said to one another, "Could someone have brought Him something to eat?"
43Jn 4:34 "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work," Jesus told them.
43Jn 4:35 "Don't you say, 'There are still four more months, then comes the harvest'? Listen [to what] I'm telling you: Open your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ready for harvest.
43Jn 4:36 The reaper is already receiving pay and gathering fruit for eternal life, so the sower and reaper can rejoice together.
43Jn 4:37 For in this case the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.'
43Jn 4:38 I sent you to reap what you didn't labor for; others have labored, and you have benefited from their labor."
43Jn 4:39 Now many Samaritans from that town believed in Him because of what the woman said when she testified, "He told me everything I ever did."
43Jn 4:40 Therefore, when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed there two days.
43Jn 4:41 Many more believed because of what He said.
43Jn 4:42 And they told the woman, "We no longer believe because of what you said, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this really is the Savior of the world."
43Jn 4:43 After two days He left there for Galilee.
43Jn 4:44 Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
43Jn 4:45 When they entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him because they had seen everything He did in Jerusalem during the festival. For they also had gone to the festival.
43Jn 4:46 Then He went again to Cana of Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. There was a certain royal official whose son was ill at Capernaum.
43Jn 4:47 When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and pleaded with Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
43Jn 4:48 Jesus told him, "Unless you [people] see signs and wonders, you will not believe."
43Jn 4:49 "Sir," the official said to Him, "come down before my boy dies!"
43Jn 4:50 "Go," Jesus told him, "your son will live." The man believed what Jesus said to him and departed.
43Jn 4:51 While he was still going down, his slaves met him saying that his boy was alive.
43Jn 4:52 He asked them at what time he got better. "Yesterday at seven in the morning the fever left him," they answered.
43Jn 4:53 The father realized this was the very hour at which Jesus had told him, "Your son will live." Then he himself believed, along with his whole household.
43Jn 4:54 This therefore was the second sign Jesus performed after He came from Judea to Galilee.
43Jn 5:1 After this, a Jewish festival took place, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43Jn 5:2 By the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there is a pool, called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five colonnades.
43Jn 5:3 Within these lay a multitude of the sick-- blind, lame, and paralyzed [[-- waiting for the moving of the water,
43Jn 5:4 because an angel would go down into the pool from time to time and stir up the water. Then the first one who got in after the water was stirred up recovered from whatever ailment he had]].
43Jn 5:5 One man was there who had been sick for 38 years.
43Jn 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had already been there a long time, He said to him, "Do you want to get well?"
43Jn 5:7 "Sir," the sick man answered, "I don't have a man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, someone goes down ahead of me."
43Jn 5:8 "Get up," Jesus told him, "pick up your bedroll and walk!"
43Jn 5:9 Instantly the man got well, picked up his bedroll, and started to walk. Now that day was the Sabbath,
43Jn 5:10 so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "This is the Sabbath! It's illegal for you to pick up your bedroll."
43Jn 5:11 He replied, "The man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your bedroll and walk.'"
43Jn 5:12 "Who is this man who told you, 'Pick up [your bedroll] and walk?' " they asked.
43Jn 5:13 But the man who was cured did not know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
43Jn 5:14 After this, Jesus found him in the temple complex and said to him, "See, you are well. Do not sin any more, so that something worse doesn't happen to you."
43Jn 5:15 The man went and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43Jn 5:16 Therefore, the Jews began persecuting Jesus because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
43Jn 5:17 But Jesus responded to them, "My Father is still working, and I am working also."
43Jn 5:18 This is why the Jews began trying all the more to kill Him: not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
43Jn 5:19 Then Jesus replied, "I assure you: The Son is not able to do anything on His own, but only what He sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does these things in the same way.
43Jn 5:20 For the Father loves the Son and shows Him everything He is doing, and He will show Him greater works than these so that you will be amazed.
43Jn 5:21 And just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to anyone He wants to.
43Jn 5:22 The Father, in fact, judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son,
43Jn 5:23 so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
43Jn 5:24 "I assure you: Anyone who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment but has passed from death to life.
43Jn 5:25 "I assure you: An hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
43Jn 5:26 For just as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted to the Son to have life in Himself.
43Jn 5:27 And He has granted Him the right to pass judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
43Jn 5:28 Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice
43Jn 5:29 and come out-- those who have done good things, to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked things, to the resurrection of judgment.
43Jn 5:30 "I can do nothing on My own. I judge only as I hear, and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
43Jn 5:31 "If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid.
43Jn 5:32 There is Another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony He gives about Me is valid.
43Jn 5:33 You have sent [messengers] to John, and he has testified to the truth.
43Jn 5:34 I don't receive man's testimony, but I say these things so that you may be saved.
43Jn 5:35 John was a burning and shining lamp, and for a time you were willing to enjoy his light.
43Jn 5:36 "But I have a greater testimony than John's because of the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish. These very works I am doing testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.
43Jn 5:37 The Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have not heard His voice at any time, and you haven't seen His form.
43Jn 5:38 You don't have His word living in you, because you don't believe the One He sent.
43Jn 5:39 You pore over the Scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them, yet they testify about Me.
43Jn 5:40 And you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
43Jn 5:41 "I do not accept glory from men,
43Jn 5:42 but I know you-- that you have no love for God within you.
43Jn 5:43 I have come in My Father's name, yet you don't accept Me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
43Jn 5:44 How can you believe? While accepting glory from one another, you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God.
43Jn 5:45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.
43Jn 5:46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me.
43Jn 5:47 But if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"
43Jn 6:1 After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
43Jn 6:2 And a huge crowd was following Him because they saw the signs that He was performing on the sick.
43Jn 6:3 So Jesus went up a mountain and sat down there with His disciples.
43Jn 6:4 Now the Passover, a Jewish festival, was near.
43Jn 6:5 Therefore, when Jesus looked up and noticed a huge crowd coming toward Him, He asked Philip, "Where will we buy bread so these people can eat?"
43Jn 6:6 He asked this to test him, for He Himself knew what He was going to do.
43Jn 6:7 Philip answered, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn't be enough for each of them to have a little."
43Jn 6:8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,
43Jn 6:9 "There's a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish-- but what are they for so many?"
43Jn 6:10 Then Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, so they sat down. The men numbered about 5,000.
43Jn 6:11 Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were seated-- so also with the fish, as much as they wanted.
43Jn 6:12 When they were full, He told His disciples, "Collect the leftovers so that nothing is wasted."
43Jn 6:13 So they collected them and filled 12 baskets with the pieces from the five barley loaves that were left over by those who had eaten.
43Jn 6:14 When the people saw the sign He had done, they said, "This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world!"
43Jn 6:15 Therefore, when Jesus knew that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.
43Jn 6:16 When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
43Jn 6:17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already set in, but Jesus had not yet come to them.
43Jn 6:18 Then a high wind arose, and the sea began to churn.
43Jn 6:19 After they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. He was coming near the boat, and they were afraid.
43Jn 6:20 But He said to them, "It is I. Don't be afraid!"
43Jn 6:21 Then they were willing to take Him on board, and at once the boat was at the shore where they were heading.
43Jn 6:22 The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea knew there had been only one boat. [They also knew] that Jesus had not boarded the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone off alone.
43Jn 6:23 Some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.
43Jn 6:24 When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.
43Jn 6:25 When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You get here?"
43Jn 6:26 Jesus answered, "I assure you: You are looking for Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.
43Jn 6:27 Don't work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal of approval on Him."
43Jn 6:28 "What can we do to perform the works of God?" they asked.
43Jn 6:29 Jesus replied, "This is the work of God: that you believe in the One He has sent."
43Jn 6:30 "What sign then are You going to do so we may see and believe You?" they asked. "What are You going to perform?
43Jn 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
43Jn 6:32 Jesus said to them, "I assure you: Moses didn't give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the real bread from heaven.
43Jn 6:33 For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43Jn 6:34 Then they said, "Sir, give us this bread always!"
43Jn 6:35 "I am the bread of life," Jesus told them. "No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in Me will ever be thirsty again.
43Jn 6:36 But as I told you, you've seen Me, and yet you do not believe.
43Jn 6:37 Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out.
43Jn 6:38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
43Jn 6:39 This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me but should raise them up on the last day.
43Jn 6:40 For this is the will of My Father: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day."
43Jn 6:41 Therefore the Jews started complaining about Him, because He said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
43Jn 6:42 They were saying, "Isn't this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can He now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"
43Jn 6:43 Jesus answered them, "Stop complaining among yourselves.
43Jn 6:44 No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.
43Jn 6:45 It is written in the Prophets: And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me--
43Jn 6:46 not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God. He has seen the Father.
43Jn 6:47 "I assure you: Anyone who believes has eternal life.
43Jn 6:48 I am the bread of life.
43Jn 6:49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
43Jn 6:50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
43Jn 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is My flesh."
43Jn 6:52 At that, the Jews argued among themselves, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?"
43Jn 6:53 So Jesus said to them, "I assure you: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
43Jn 6:54 Anyone who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day,
43Jn 6:55 because My flesh is real food and My blood is real drink.
43Jn 6:56 The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood lives in Me, and I in him.
43Jn 6:57 Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.
43Jn 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven; it is not like the manna your fathers ate-- and they died. The one who eats this bread will live forever."
43Jn 6:59 He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43Jn 6:60 Therefore, when many of His disciples heard this, they said, "This teaching is hard! Who can accept it?"
43Jn 6:61 Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were complaining about this, asked them, "Does this offend you?
43Jn 6:62 Then what if you were to observe the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
43Jn 6:63 The Spirit is the One who gives life. The flesh doesn't help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
43Jn 6:64 But there are some among you who don't believe." (For Jesus knew from the beginning those who would not believe and the one who would betray Him.)
43Jn 6:65 He said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted to him by the Father."
43Jn 6:66 From that moment many of His disciples turned back and no longer accompanied Him.
43Jn 6:67 Therefore Jesus said to the Twelve, "You don't want to go away too, do you?"
43Jn 6:68 Simon Peter answered, "Lord, who will we go to? You have the words of eternal life.
43Jn 6:69 We have come to believe and know that You are the Holy One of God!"
43Jn 6:70 Jesus replied to them, "Didn't I choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is the Devil!"
43Jn 6:71 He was referring to Judas, Simon Iscariot's son, one of the Twelve, because he was going to betray Him.
43Jn 7:1 After this, Jesus traveled in Galilee, since He did not want to travel in Judea because the Jews were trying to kill Him.
43Jn 7:2 The Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
43Jn 7:3 so His brothers said to Him, "Leave here and go to Judea so Your disciples can see Your works that You are doing.
43Jn 7:4 For no one does anything in secret while he's seeking public recognition. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."
43Jn 7:5 (For not even His brothers believed in Him.)
43Jn 7:6 Jesus told them, "My time has not yet arrived, but your time is always at hand.
43Jn 7:7 The world cannot hate you, but it does hate Me because I testify about it-- that its deeds are evil.
43Jn 7:8 Go up to the festival yourselves. I'm not going up to the festival yet, because My time has not yet fully come."
43Jn 7:9 After He had said these things, He stayed in Galilee.
43Jn 7:10 After His brothers had gone up to the festival, then He also went up, not openly but secretly.
43Jn 7:11 The Jews were looking for Him at the festival and saying, "Where is He?"
43Jn 7:12 And there was a lot of discussion about Him among the crowds. Some were saying, "He's a good man." Others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He's deceiving the people."
43Jn 7:13 Still, nobody was talking publicly about Him because they feared the Jews.
43Jn 7:14 When the festival was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple complex and began to teach.
43Jn 7:15 Then the Jews were amazed and said, "How does He know the Scriptures, since He hasn't been trained?"
43Jn 7:16 Jesus answered them, "My teaching isn't Mine but is from the One who sent Me.
43Jn 7:17 If anyone wants to do His will, he will understand whether the teaching is from God or if I am speaking on My own.
43Jn 7:18 The one who speaks for himself seeks his own glory. But He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
43Jn 7:19 Didn't Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law! Why do you want to kill Me?"
43Jn 7:20 "You have a demon!" the crowd responded. "Who wants to kill You?"
43Jn 7:21 "I did one work, and you are all amazed," Jesus answered.
43Jn 7:22 "Consider this: Moses has given you circumcision-- not that it comes from Moses but from the fathers-- and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
43Jn 7:23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses won't be broken, are you angry at Me because I made a man entirely well on the Sabbath?
43Jn 7:24 Stop judging according to outward appearances; rather judge according to righteous judgment."
43Jn 7:25 Some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, "Isn't this the man they want to kill?
43Jn 7:26 Yet, look! He's speaking publicly and they're saying nothing to Him. Can it be true that the authorities know He is the Messiah?
43Jn 7:27 But we know where this man is from. When the Messiah comes, nobody will know where He is from."
43Jn 7:28 As He was teaching in the temple complex, Jesus cried out, "You know Me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on My own, but the One who sent Me is true. You don't know Him;
43Jn 7:29 I know Him because I am from Him, and He sent Me."
43Jn 7:30 Then they tried to seize Him. Yet no one laid a hand on Him because His hour had not yet come.
43Jn 7:31 However, many from the crowd believed in Him and said, "When the Messiah comes, He won't perform more signs than this man has done, will He?"
43Jn 7:32 The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple police to arrest Him.
43Jn 7:33 Then Jesus said, "I am only with you for a short time. Then I'm going to the One who sent Me.
43Jn 7:34 You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43Jn 7:35 Then the Jews said to one another, "Where does He intend to go so we won't find Him? He doesn't intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does He?
43Jn 7:36 What is this remark He made: 'You will look for Me, and you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
43Jn 7:37 On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, he should come to Me and drink!
43Jn 7:38 The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, will have streams of living water flow from deep within him."
43Jn 7:39 He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been received, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
43Jn 7:40 When some from the crowd heard these words, they said, "This really is the Prophet!"
43Jn 7:41 Others said, "This is the Messiah!" But some said, "Surely the Messiah doesn't come from Galilee, does He?
43Jn 7:42 Doesn't the Scripture say that the Messiah comes from David's offspring and from the town of Bethlehem, where David once lived?"
43Jn 7:43 So a division occurred among the crowd because of Him.
43Jn 7:44 Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
43Jn 7:45 Then the temple police came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why haven't you brought Him?"
43Jn 7:46 The police answered, "No man ever spoke like this!"
43Jn 7:47 Then the Pharisees responded to them: "Are you fooled too?
43Jn 7:48 Have any of the rulers believed in Him? Or any of the Pharisees?
43Jn 7:49 But this crowd, which doesn't know the law, is accursed!"
43Jn 7:50 Nicodemus-- the one who came to Him previously, being one of them-- said to them,
43Jn 7:51 "Our law doesn't judge a man before it hears from him and knows what he's doing, does it?"
43Jn 7:52 "You aren't from Galilee too, are you?" they replied. "Investigate and you will see that no prophet arises from Galilee."
43Jn 7:53 [[So each one went to his house.
43Jn 8:1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43Jn 8:2 At dawn He went to the temple complex again, and all the people were coming to Him. He sat down and began to teach them.
43Jn 8:3 Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, making her stand in the center.
43Jn 8:4 "Teacher," they said to Him, "this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.
43Jn 8:5 In the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do You say?"
43Jn 8:6 They asked this to trap Him, in order that they might have evidence to accuse Him. Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with His finger.
43Jn 8:7 When they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, "The one without sin among you should be the first to throw a stone at her."
43Jn 8:8 Then He stooped down again and continued writing on the ground.
43Jn 8:9 When they heard this, they left one by one, starting with the older men. Only He was left, with the woman in the center.
43Jn 8:10 When Jesus stood up, He said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
43Jn 8:11 "No one, Lord," she answered. "Neither do I condemn you," said Jesus. "Go, and from now on do not sin any more."]]
43Jn 8:12 Then Jesus spoke to them again: "I am the light of the world. Anyone who follows Me will never walk in the darkness but will have the light of life."
43Jn 8:13 So the Pharisees said to Him, "You are testifying about Yourself. Your testimony is not valid."
43Jn 8:14 "Even if I testify about Myself," Jesus replied, "My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I'm going. But you don't know where I come from or where I'm going.
43Jn 8:15 You judge by human standards. I judge no one.
43Jn 8:16 And if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me [judge together].
43Jn 8:17 Even in your law it is written that the witness of two men is valid.
43Jn 8:18 I am the One who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me."
43Jn 8:19 Then they asked Him, "Where is Your Father?" "You know neither Me nor My Father," Jesus answered. "If you knew Me, you would also know My Father."
43Jn 8:20 He spoke these words by the treasury, while teaching in the temple complex. But no one seized Him, because His hour had not come.
43Jn 8:21 Then He said to them again, "I'm going away; you will look for Me, and you will die in your sin. Where I'm going, you cannot come."
43Jn 8:22 So the Jews said again, "He won't kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I'm going, you cannot come'?"
43Jn 8:23 "You are from below," He told them, "I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
43Jn 8:24 Therefore I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am [He], you will die in your sins."
43Jn 8:25 "Who are You?" they questioned. "Precisely what I've been telling you from the very beginning," Jesus told them.
43Jn 8:26 "I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the One who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him-- these things I tell the world."
43Jn 8:27 They did not know He was speaking to them about the Father.
43Jn 8:28 So Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [He], and that I do nothing on My own. But just as the Father taught Me, I say these things.
43Jn 8:29 The One who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him."
43Jn 8:30 As He was saying these things, many believed in Him.
43Jn 8:31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him, "If you continue in My word, you really are My disciples.
43Jn 8:32 You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
43Jn 8:33 "We are descendants of Abraham," they answered Him, "and we have never been enslaved to anyone. How can You say, 'You will become free'?"
43Jn 8:34 Jesus responded, "I assure you: Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
43Jn 8:35 A slave does not remain in the household forever, but a son does remain forever.
43Jn 8:36 Therefore if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.
43Jn 8:37 I know you are descendants of Abraham, but you are trying to kill Me because My word is not welcome among you.
43Jn 8:38 I speak what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and therefore you do what you have heard from your father."
43Jn 8:39 "Our father is Abraham!" they replied. "If you were Abraham's children," Jesus told them, "you would do what Abraham did.
43Jn 8:40 But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this!
43Jn 8:41 You're doing what your father does." "We weren't born of sexual immorality," they said. "We have one Father-- God."
43Jn 8:42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, because I came from God and I am here. For I didn't come on My own, but He sent Me.
43Jn 8:43 Why don't you understand what I say? Because you cannot listen to My word.
43Jn 8:44 You are of your father the Devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of liars.
43Jn 8:45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.
43Jn 8:46 Who among you can convict Me of sin? If I tell the truth, why don't you believe Me?
43Jn 8:47 The one who is from God listens to God's words. This is why you don't listen, because you are not from God."
43Jn 8:48 The Jews responded to Him, "Aren't we right in saying that You're a Samaritan and have a demon?"
43Jn 8:49 "I do not have a demon," Jesus answered. "On the contrary, I honor My Father and you dishonor Me.
43Jn 8:50 I do not seek My glory; the One who seeks it also judges.
43Jn 8:51 I assure you: If anyone keeps My word, he will never see death-- ever!"
43Jn 8:52 Then the Jews said, "Now we know You have a demon. Abraham died and so did the prophets. You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he will never taste death-- ever!'
43Jn 8:53 Are You greater than our father Abraham who died? Even the prophets died. Who do You pretend to be?"
43Jn 8:54 "If I glorify Myself," Jesus answered, "My glory is nothing. My Father-- you say about Him, 'He is our God.'-- He is the One who glorifies Me.
43Jn 8:55 You've never known Him, but I know Him. If I were to say I don't know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.
43Jn 8:56 Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see My day; he saw it and rejoiced."
43Jn 8:57 The Jews replied, "You aren't 50 years old yet, and You've seen Abraham?"
43Jn 8:58 Jesus said to them, "I assure you: Before Abraham was, I am."
43Jn 8:59 At that, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple complex.
43Jn 9:1 As He was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth.
43Jn 9:2 His disciples questioned Him: "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43Jn 9:3 "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," Jesus answered. "[This came about] so that God's works might be displayed in him.
43Jn 9:4 We must do the works of Him who sent Me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work.
43Jn 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43Jn 9:6 After He said these things He spit on the ground, made some mud from the saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes.
43Jn 9:7 "Go," He told him, "wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he left, washed, and came back seeing.
43Jn 9:8 His neighbors and those who formerly had seen him as a beggar said, "Isn't this the man who sat begging?"
43Jn 9:9 Some said, "He's the one." "No," others were saying, "but he looks like him." He kept saying, "I'm the one!"
43Jn 9:10 Therefore they asked him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"
43Jn 9:11 He answered, "The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So when I went and washed I received my sight."
43Jn 9:12 "Where is He?" they asked. "I don't know," he said.
43Jn 9:13 They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
43Jn 9:14 The day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.
43Jn 9:15 So again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," he told them. "I washed and I can see."
43Jn 9:16 Therefore some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for He doesn't keep the Sabbath!" But others were saying, "How can a sinful man perform such signs?" And there was a division among them.
43Jn 9:17 Again they asked the blind man, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" "He's a prophet," he said.
43Jn 9:18 The Jews did not believe this about him-- that he was blind and received sight-- until they summoned the parents of the one who had received his sight.
43Jn 9:19 They asked them, "Is this your son, [the one] you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
43Jn 9:20 "We know this is our son and that he was born blind," his parents answered.
43Jn 9:21 "But we don't know how he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he's of age. He will speak for himself."
43Jn 9:22 His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews, since the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him as Messiah, he would be banned from the synagogue.
43Jn 9:23 This is why his parents said, "He's of age; ask him."
43Jn 9:24 So a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner!"
43Jn 9:25 He answered, "Whether or not He's a sinner, I don't know. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!"
43Jn 9:26 Then they asked him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
43Jn 9:27 "I already told you," he said, "and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become His disciples too, do you?"
43Jn 9:28 They ridiculed him: "You're that man's disciple, but we're Moses' disciples.
43Jn 9:29 We know that God has spoken to Moses. But this man-- we don't know where He's from!"
43Jn 9:30 "This is an amazing thing," the man told them. "You don't know where He is from, yet He opened my eyes!
43Jn 9:31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him.
43Jn 9:32 Throughout history no one has ever heard of someone opening the eyes of a person born blind.
43Jn 9:33 If this man were not from God, He wouldn't be able to do anything."
43Jn 9:34 "You were born entirely in sin," they replied, "and are you trying to teach us?" Then they threw him out.
43Jn 9:35 When Jesus heard that they had thrown the man out, He found him and asked, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43Jn 9:36 "Who is He, Sir, that I may believe in Him?" he asked.
43Jn 9:37 Jesus answered, "You have seen Him; in fact, He is the One speaking with you."
43Jn 9:38 "I believe, Lord!" he said, and he worshiped Him.
43Jn 9:39 Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, in order that those who do not see will see and those who do see will become blind."
43Jn 9:40 Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and asked Him, "We aren't blind too, are we?"
43Jn 9:41 "If you were blind," Jesus told them, "you wouldn't have sin. But now that you say, 'We see'-- your sin remains.
43Jn 10:1 "I assure you: Anyone who doesn't enter the sheep pen by the door but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.
43Jn 10:2 The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
43Jn 10:3 The doorkeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43Jn 10:4 When he has brought all his own outside, he goes ahead of them. The sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.
43Jn 10:5 They will never follow a stranger; instead they will run away from him, because they don't recognize the voice of strangers."
43Jn 10:6 Jesus gave them this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.
43Jn 10:7 So Jesus said again, "I assure you: I am the door of the sheep.
43Jn 10:8 All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.
43Jn 10:9 I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved and will come in and go out and find pasture.
43Jn 10:10 A thief comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance.
43Jn 10:11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:12 The hired man, since he is not the shepherd and doesn't own the sheep, leaves them and runs away when he sees a wolf coming. The wolf then snatches and scatters them.
43Jn 10:13 [This happens] because he is a hired man and doesn't care about the sheep.
43Jn 10:14 "I am the good shepherd. I know My own sheep, and they know Me,
43Jn 10:15 as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father. I lay down My life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:16 But I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock, one shepherd.
43Jn 10:17 This is why the Father loves Me, because I am laying down My life so I may take it up again.
43Jn 10:18 No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down on My own. I have the right to lay it down, and I have the right to take it up again. I have received this command from My Father."
43Jn 10:19 Again a division took place among the Jews because of these words.
43Jn 10:20 Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and He's crazy! Why do you listen to Him?"
43Jn 10:21 Others were saying, "These aren't the words of someone demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43Jn 10:22 Then the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
43Jn 10:23 Jesus was walking in the temple complex in Solomon's Colonnade.
43Jn 10:24 Then the Jews surrounded Him and asked, "How long are You going to keep us in suspense? If You are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
43Jn 10:25 "I did tell you and you don't believe," Jesus answered them. "The works that I do in My Father's name testify about Me.
43Jn 10:26 But you don't believe because you are not My sheep.
43Jn 10:27 My sheep hear My voice, I know them, and they follow Me.
43Jn 10:28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish-- ever! No one will snatch them out of My hand.
43Jn 10:29 My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
43Jn 10:30 The Father and I are one."
43Jn 10:31 Again the Jews picked up rocks to stone Him.
43Jn 10:32 Jesus replied, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. Which of these works are you stoning Me for?"
43Jn 10:33 "We aren't stoning You for a good work," the Jews answered, "but for blasphemy, because You-- being a man-- make Yourself God."
43Jn 10:34 Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, I said, you are gods?
43Jn 10:35 If He called those whom the word of God came to 'gods'-- and the Scripture cannot be broken--
43Jn 10:36 do you say, 'You are blaspheming' to the One the Father set apart and sent into the world, because I said: I am the Son of God?
43Jn 10:37 If I am not doing My Father's works, don't believe Me.
43Jn 10:38 But if I am doing them and you don't believe Me, believe the works. This way you will know and understand that the Father is in Me and I in the Father."
43Jn 10:39 Then they were trying again to seize Him, yet He eluded their grasp.
43Jn 10:40 So He departed again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and He remained there.
43Jn 10:41 Many came to Him and said, "John never did a sign, but everything John said about this man was true."
43Jn 10:42 And many believed in Him there.
43Jn 11:1 Now a man was sick, Lazarus, from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
43Jn 11:2 Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, and it was her brother Lazarus who was sick.
43Jn 11:3 So the sisters sent a message to Him: "Lord, the one You love is sick."
43Jn 11:4 When Jesus heard it, He said, "This sickness will not end in death but is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
43Jn 11:5 (Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus.)
43Jn 11:6 So when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was.
43Jn 11:7 Then after that, He said to the disciples, "Let's go to Judea again."
43Jn 11:8 "Rabbi," the disciples told Him, "just now the Jews tried to stone You, and You're going there again?"
43Jn 11:9 "Aren't there 12 hours in a day?" Jesus answered. "If anyone walks during the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
43Jn 11:10 If anyone walks during the night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him."
43Jn 11:11 He said this, and then He told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I'm on My way to wake him up."
43Jn 11:12 Then the disciples said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well."
43Jn 11:13 Jesus, however, was speaking about his death, but they thought He was speaking about natural sleep.
43Jn 11:14 So Jesus then told them plainly, "Lazarus has died.
43Jn 11:15 I'm glad for you that I wasn't there so that you may believe. But let's go to him."
43Jn 11:16 Then Thomas (called "Twin") said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go so that we may die with Him."
43Jn 11:17 When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.
43Jn 11:18 Bethany was near Jerusalem (about two miles away).
43Jn 11:19 Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother.
43Jn 11:20 As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet Him. But Mary remained seated in the house.
43Jn 11:21 Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.
43Jn 11:22 Yet even now I know that whatever You ask from God, God will give You."
43Jn 11:23 "Your brother will rise again," Jesus told her.
43Jn 11:24 Martha said, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43Jn 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in Me, even if he dies, will live.
43Jn 11:26 Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die-- ever. Do you believe this?"
43Jn 11:27 "Yes, Lord," she told Him, "I believe You are the Messiah, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
43Jn 11:28 Having said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, saying in private, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
43Jn 11:29 As soon as she heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
43Jn 11:30 Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met Him.
43Jn 11:31 The Jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw that Mary got up quickly and went out. So they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to cry there.
43Jn 11:32 When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet and told Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died!"
43Jn 11:33 When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, He was angry in His spirit and deeply moved.
43Jn 11:34 "Where have you put him?" He asked. "Lord," they told Him, "come and see."
43Jn 11:35 Jesus wept.
43Jn 11:36 So the Jews said, "See how He loved him!"
43Jn 11:37 But some of them said, "Couldn't He who opened the blind man's eyes also have kept this man from dying?"
43Jn 11:38 Then Jesus, angry in Himself again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
43Jn 11:39 "Remove the stone," Jesus said. Martha, the dead man's sister, told Him, "Lord, he already stinks. It's been four days."
43Jn 11:40 Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?"
43Jn 11:41 So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You heard Me.
43Jn 11:42 I know that You always hear Me, but because of the crowd standing here I said this, so they may believe You sent Me."
43Jn 11:43 After He said this, He shouted with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
43Jn 11:44 The dead man came out bound hand and foot with linen strips and with his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Loose him and let him go."
43Jn 11:45 Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what He did believed in Him.
43Jn 11:46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43Jn 11:47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, "What are we going to do since this man does many signs?
43Jn 11:48 If we let Him continue in this way, everybody will believe in Him! Then the Romans will come and remove both our place and our nation."
43Jn 11:49 One of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all!
43Jn 11:50 You're not considering that it is to your advantage that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish."
43Jn 11:51 He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
43Jn 11:52 and not for the nation only, but also to unite the scattered children of God.
43Jn 11:53 So from that day on they plotted to kill Him.
43Jn 11:54 Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews but departed from there to the countryside near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim. And He stayed there with the disciples.
43Jn 11:55 The Jewish Passover was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country to purify themselves before the Passover.
43Jn 11:56 They were looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple complex: "What do you think? He won't come to the festival, will He?"
43Jn 11:57 The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it so they could arrest Him.
43Jn 12:1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, the one Jesus had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:2 So they gave a dinner for Him there; Martha was serving them, and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.
43Jn 12:3 Then Mary took a pound of fragrant oil-- pure and expensive nard-- anointed Jesus' feet, and wiped His feet with her hair. So the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
43Jn 12:4 Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was about to betray Him), said,
43Jn 12:5 "Why wasn't this fragrant oil sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?"
43Jn 12:6 He didn't say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the money-bag and would steal part of what was put in it.
43Jn 12:7 Jesus answered, "Leave her alone; she has kept it for the day of My burial.
43Jn 12:8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me."
43Jn 12:9 Then a large crowd of the Jews learned He was there. They came not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus the one He had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:10 Therefore the chief priests decided to also kill Lazarus,
43Jn 12:11 because he was the reason many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus.
43Jn 12:12 The next day, when the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
43Jn 12:13 they took palm branches and went out to meet Him. They kept shouting: " Hosanna!</> Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord-- the King of Israel!"
43Jn 12:14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written:
43Jn 12:15 Fear no more, Daughter Zion; look! your King is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt.
43Jn 12:16 His disciples did not understand these things at first. However, when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.
43Jn 12:17 Meanwhile the crowd, which had been with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify.
43Jn 12:18 This is also why the crowd met Him, because they heard He had done this sign.
43Jn 12:19 Then the Pharisees said to one another, "You see? You've accomplished nothing. Look-- the world has gone after Him!"
43Jn 12:20 Now some Greeks were among those who went up to worship at the festival.
43Jn 12:21 So they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
43Jn 12:22 Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
43Jn 12:23 Jesus replied to them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43Jn 12:24 "I assure you: Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself. But if it dies, it produces a large crop.
43Jn 12:25 The one who loves his life will lose it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
43Jn 12:26 If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me. Where I am, there My servant also will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
43Jn 12:27 "Now My soul is troubled. What should I say-- Father, save Me from this hour? But that is why I came to this hour.
43Jn 12:28 Father, glorify Your name!" Then a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!"
43Jn 12:29 The crowd standing there heard it and said it was thunder. Others said, "An angel has spoken to Him!"
43Jn 12:30 Jesus responded, "This voice came, not for Me, but for you.
43Jn 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
43Jn 12:32 As for Me, if I am lifted up from the earth I will draw all [people] to Myself."
43Jn 12:33 He said this to signify what kind of death He was about to die.
43Jn 12:34 Then the crowd replied to Him, "We have heard from the law that the Messiah will remain forever. So how can You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
43Jn 12:35 Jesus answered, "The light will be with you only a little longer. Walk while you have the light so that darkness doesn't overtake you. The one who walks in darkness doesn't know where he's going.
43Jn 12:36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light." Jesus said this, then went away and hid from them.
43Jn 12:37 Even though He had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in Him.
43Jn 12:38 But this was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet, who said: Lord, who has believed our message? And who has the arm of the Lord been revealed to?
43Jn 12:39 This is why they were unable to believe, because Isaiah also said:
43Jn 12:40 He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they would not see with their eyes or understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I would heal them.
43Jn 12:41 Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke about Him.
43Jn 12:42 Nevertheless, many did believe in Him even among the rulers, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so they would not be banned from the synagogue.
43Jn 12:43 For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.
43Jn 12:44 Then Jesus cried out, "The one who believes in Me believes not in Me, but in Him who sent Me.
43Jn 12:45 And the one who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.
43Jn 12:46 I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me would not remain in darkness.
43Jn 12:47 If anyone hears My words and doesn't keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
43Jn 12:48 The one who rejects Me and doesn't accept My sayings has this as his judge: the word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
43Jn 12:49 For I have not spoken on My own, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a command as to what I should say and what I should speak.
43Jn 12:50 I know that His command is eternal life. So the things that I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me."
43Jn 13:1 Before the Passover Festival, Jesus knew that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
43Jn 13:2 Now by the time of supper, the Devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, Simon Iscariot's son, to betray Him.
43Jn 13:3 Jesus knew that the Father had given everything into His hands, that He had come from God, and that He was going back to God.
43Jn 13:4 So He got up from supper, laid aside His robe, took a towel, and tied it around Himself.
43Jn 13:5 Next, He poured water into a basin and began to wash His disciples' feet and to dry them with the towel tied around Him.
43Jn 13:6 He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, "Lord, are You going to wash my feet?"
43Jn 13:7 Jesus answered him, "What I'm doing you don't understand now, but afterwards you will know."
43Jn 13:8 "You will never wash my feet-- ever!" Peter said. Jesus replied, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with Me."
43Jn 13:9 Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head."
43Jn 13:10 "One who has bathed," Jesus told him, "doesn't need to wash anything except his feet, but he is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
43Jn 13:11 For He knew who would betray Him. This is why He said, "You are not all clean."
43Jn 13:12 When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His robe, He reclined again and said to them, "Do you know what I have done for you?
43Jn 13:13 You call Me Teacher and Lord. This is well said, for I am.
43Jn 13:14 So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
43Jn 13:15 For I have given you an example that you also should do just as I have done for you.
43Jn 13:16 "I assure you: A slave is not greater than his master, and a messenger is not greater than the one who sent him.
43Jn 13:17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
43Jn 13:18 I'm not speaking about all of you; I know those I have chosen. But the Scripture must be fulfilled: The one who eats My bread has raised his heel against Me.
43Jn 13:19 "I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am [He].
43Jn 13:20 I assure you: The one who receives whomever I send receives Me, and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
43Jn 13:21 When Jesus had said this, He was troubled in His spirit and testified, "I assure you: One of you will betray Me!"
43Jn 13:22 The disciples started looking at one another-- uncertain which one He was speaking about.
43Jn 13:23 One of His disciples, the one Jesus loved, was reclining close beside Jesus.
43Jn 13:24 Simon Peter motioned to him to find out who it was He was talking about.
43Jn 13:25 So he leaned back against Jesus and asked Him, "Lord, who is it?"
43Jn 13:26 Jesus replied, "He's the one I give the piece of bread to after I have dipped it." When He had dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas, Simon Iscariot's son.
43Jn 13:27 After [Judas ate] the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus told him, "What you're doing, do quickly."
43Jn 13:28 None of those reclining at the table knew why He told him this.
43Jn 13:29 Since Judas kept the money-bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the festival," or that he should give something to the poor.
43Jn 13:30 After receiving the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.
43Jn 13:31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
43Jn 13:32 If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself and will glorify Him at once.
43Jn 13:33 "Children, I am with you a little while longer. You will look for Me, and just as I told the Jews, 'Where I am going you cannot come,' so now I tell you.
43Jn 13:34 "I give you a new commandment: love one another. Just as I have loved you, you must also love one another.
43Jn 13:35 By this all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."
43Jn 13:36 "Lord," Simon Peter said to Him, "where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later."
43Jn 13:37 "Lord," Peter asked, "why can't I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You!"
43Jn 13:38 Jesus replied, "Will you lay down your life for Me? I assure you: A rooster will not crow until you have denied Me three times.
43Jn 14:1 "Your heart must not be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in Me.
43Jn 14:2 In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if not, I would have told you. I am going away to prepare a place for you.
43Jn 14:3 If I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come back and receive you to Myself, so that where I am you may be also.
43Jn 14:4 You know the way where I am going."
43Jn 14:5 "Lord," Thomas said, "we don't know where You're going. How can we know the way?"
43Jn 14:6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
43Jn 14:7 "If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him."
43Jn 14:8 "Lord," said Philip, "show us the Father, and that's enough for us."
43Jn 14:9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been among you all this time without your knowing Me, Philip? The one who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
43Jn 14:10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I speak to you I do not speak on My own. The Father who lives in Me does His works.
43Jn 14:11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me. Otherwise, believe because of the works themselves.
43Jn 14:12 "I assure you: The one who believes in Me will also do the works that I do. And he will do even greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.
43Jn 14:13 Whatever you ask in My name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
43Jn 14:14 If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.
43Jn 14:15 "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
43Jn 14:16 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Counselor to be with you forever.
43Jn 14:17 He is the Spirit of truth. The world is unable to receive Him because it doesn't see Him or know Him. But you do know Him, because He remains with you and will be in you.
43Jn 14:18 I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
43Jn 14:19 "In a little while the world will see Me no longer, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live too.
43Jn 14:20 In that day you will know that I am in My Father, you are in Me, and I am in you.
43Jn 14:21 The one who has My commands and keeps them is the one who loves Me. And the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father. I also will love him and will reveal Myself to him."
43Jn 14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, how is it You're going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?"
43Jn 14:23 Jesus answered, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.
43Jn 14:24 The one who doesn't love Me will not keep My words. The word that you hear is not Mine but is from the Father who sent Me.
43Jn 14:25 "I have spoken these things to you while I remain with you.
43Jn 14:26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit-- the Father will send Him in My name-- will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have told you.
43Jn 14:27 "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Your heart must not be troubled or fearful.
43Jn 14:28 You have heard Me tell you, 'I am going away and I am coming to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
43Jn 14:29 I have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen you may believe.
43Jn 14:30 I will not talk with you much longer, because the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over Me.
43Jn 14:31 On the contrary, [I am going away] so that the world may know that I love the Father. Just as the Father commanded Me, so I do. "Get up; let's leave this place.
43Jn 15:1 "I am the true vine, and My Father is the vineyard keeper.
43Jn 15:2 Every branch in Me that does not produce fruit He removes, and He prunes every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce more fruit.
43Jn 15:3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
43Jn 15:4 Remain in Me, and I in you. Just as a branch is unable to produce fruit by itself unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in Me.
43Jn 15:5 "I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without Me.
43Jn 15:6 If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown aside like a branch and he withers. They gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
43Jn 15:7 If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be done for you.
43Jn 15:8 My Father is glorified by this: that you produce much fruit and prove to be My disciples.
43Jn 15:9 "As the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Remain in My love.
43Jn 15:10 If you keep My commands you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commands and remain in His love.
43Jn 15:11 "I have spoken these things to you so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
43Jn 15:12 This is My command: love one another as I have loved you.
43Jn 15:13 No one has greater love than this, that someone would lay down his life for his friends.
43Jn 15:14 You are My friends if you do what I command you.
43Jn 15:15 I do not call you slaves anymore, because a slave doesn't know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything I have heard from My Father.
43Jn 15:16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you. I appointed you that you should go out and produce fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.
43Jn 15:17 This is what I command you: love one another.
43Jn 15:18 "If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me before it hated you.
43Jn 15:19 If you were of the world, the world would love [you as] its own. However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you.
43Jn 15:20 Remember the word I spoke to you: 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will also keep yours.
43Jn 15:21 But they will do all these things to you on account of My name, because they don't know the One who sent Me.
43Jn 15:22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. Now they have no excuse for their sin.
43Jn 15:23 The one who hates Me also hates My Father.
43Jn 15:24 If I had not done the works among them that no one else has done, they would not have sin. Now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.
43Jn 15:25 But [this happened] so that the statement written in their law might be fulfilled: They hated Me for no reason.
43Jn 15:26 "When the Counselor comes, the One I will send to you from the Father-- the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father-- He will testify about Me.
43Jn 15:27 You also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
43Jn 16:1 "I have told you these things to keep you from stumbling.
43Jn 16:2 They will ban you from the synagogues. In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering service to God.
43Jn 16:3 They will do these things because they haven't known the Father or Me.
43Jn 16:4 But I have told you these things so that when their time comes you may remember I told them to you. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
43Jn 16:5 "But now I am going away to Him who sent Me, and not one of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'
43Jn 16:6 Yet, because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
43Jn 16:7 Nevertheless, I am telling you the truth. It is for your benefit that I go away, because if I don't go away the Counselor will not come to you. If I go, I will send Him to you.
43Jn 16:8 When He comes, He will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment:
43Jn 16:9 about sin, because they do not believe in Me;
43Jn 16:10 about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see Me;
43Jn 16:11 and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
43Jn 16:12 "I still have many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.
43Jn 16:13 When the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth. For He will not speak on His own, but He will speak whatever He hears. He will also declare to you what is to come.
43Jn 16:14 He will glorify Me, because He will take from what is Mine and declare it to you.
43Jn 16:15 Everything the Father has is Mine. This is why I told you that He takes from what is Mine and will declare it to you.
43Jn 16:16 "A little while and you will no longer see Me; again a little while and you will see Me."
43Jn 16:17 Therefore some of His disciples said to one another, "What is this He tells us: 'A little while and you will not see Me; again a little while and you will see Me'; and, 'because I am going to the Father'?"
43Jn 16:18 They said, "What is this He is saying, 'A little while'? We don't know what He's talking about!"
43Jn 16:19 Jesus knew they wanted to question Him, so He said to them, "Are you asking one another about what I said, 'A little while and you will not see Me; again a little while and you will see Me'?
43Jn 16:20 "I assure you: You will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice. You will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn to joy.
43Jn 16:21 When a woman is in labor she has pain because her time has come. But when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the suffering because of the joy that a person has been born into the world.
43Jn 16:22 So you also have sorrow now. But I will see you again. Your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.
43Jn 16:23 In that day you will not ask Me anything. "I assure you: Anything you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.
43Jn 16:24 Until now you have asked for nothing in My name. Ask and you will receive, that your joy may be complete.
43Jn 16:25 "I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. A time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.
43Jn 16:26 In that day you will ask in My name. I am not telling you that I will make requests to the Father on your behalf.
43Jn 16:27 For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God.
43Jn 16:28 I came from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father."
43Jn 16:29 "Ah!" His disciples said. "Now You're speaking plainly and not using any figurative language.
43Jn 16:30 Now we know that You know everything and don't need anyone to question You. By this we believe that You came from God."
43Jn 16:31 Jesus responded to them, "Do you now believe?
43Jn 16:32 Look: An hour is coming, and has come, when each of you will be scattered to his own home, and you will leave Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
43Jn 16:33 I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. You will have suffering in this world. Be courageous! I have conquered the world."
43Jn 17:1 Jesus spoke these things, looked up to heaven, and said: Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son so that the Son may glorify You,
43Jn 17:2 for You gave Him authority over all flesh; so He may give eternal life to all You have given Him.
43Jn 17:3 This is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and the One You have sent-- Jesus Christ.
43Jn 17:4 I have glorified You on the earth by completing the work You gave Me to do.
43Jn 17:5 Now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with that glory I had with You before the world existed.
43Jn 17:6 I have revealed Your name to the men You gave Me from the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
43Jn 17:7 Now they know that all things You have given to Me are from You,
43Jn 17:8 because the words that You gave Me, I have given them. They have received them and have known for certain that I came from You. They have believed that You sent Me.
43Jn 17:9 I pray for them. I am not praying for the world but for those You have given Me, because they are Yours.
43Jn 17:10 All My things are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I have been glorified in them.
43Jn 17:11 I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, protect them by Your name that You have given Me, so that they may be one as We are one.
43Jn 17:12 While I was with them, I was protecting them by Your name that You have given Me. I guarded them and not one of them is lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
43Jn 17:13 Now I am coming to You, and I speak these things in the world so that they may have My joy completed in them.
43Jn 17:14 I have given them Your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
43Jn 17:15 I am not praying that You take them out of the world but that You protect them from the evil one.
43Jn 17:16 They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
43Jn 17:17 Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.
43Jn 17:18 As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
43Jn 17:19 I sanctify Myself for them, so they also may be sanctified by the truth.
43Jn 17:20 I pray not only for these, but also for those who believe in Me through their message.
43Jn 17:21 May they all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I am in You. May they also be one in Us, so the world may believe You sent Me.
43Jn 17:22 I have given them the glory You have given Me. May they be one as We are one.
43Jn 17:23 I am in them and You are in Me. May they be made completely one, so the world may know You have sent Me and have loved them as You have loved Me.
43Jn 17:24 Father, I desire those You have given Me to be with Me where I am. Then they will see My glory, which You have given Me because You loved Me before the world's foundation.
43Jn 17:25 Righteous Father! The world has not known You. However, I have known You, and these have known that You sent Me.
43Jn 17:26 I made Your name known to them and will make it known, so the love You have loved Me with may be in them and I may be in them.
43Jn 18:1 After Jesus had said these things, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, and He and His disciples went into it.
43Jn 18:2 Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, because Jesus often met there with His disciples.
43Jn 18:3 So Judas took a company of soldiers and some temple police from the chief priests and the Pharisees and came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
43Jn 18:4 Then Jesus, knowing everything that was about to happen to Him, went out and said to them, "Who is it you're looking for?"
43Jn 18:5 "Jesus the Nazarene," they answered. "I am He," Jesus told them. Judas, who betrayed Him, was also standing with them.
43Jn 18:6 When He told them, "I am He," they stepped back and fell to the ground.
43Jn 18:7 Then He asked them again, "Who is it you're looking for?" "Jesus the Nazarene," they said.
43Jn 18:8 "I told you I am [He]," Jesus replied. "So if you're looking for Me, let these men go."
43Jn 18:9 This was to fulfill the words He had said: "I have not lost one of those You have given Me."
43Jn 18:10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. (The slave's name was Malchus.)
43Jn 18:11 At that, Jesus said to Peter, "Sheathe your sword! Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given Me?"
43Jn 18:12 Then the company of soldiers, the commander, and the Jewish temple police arrested Jesus and tied Him up.
43Jn 18:13 First they led Him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
43Jn 18:14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was advantageous that one man should die for the people.
43Jn 18:15 Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, as was another disciple. That disciple was an acquaintance of the high priest; so he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard.
43Jn 18:16 But Peter remained standing outside by the door. So the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who was the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
43Jn 18:17 Then the slave girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, "You aren't one of this man's disciples too, are you?" "I am not!" he said.
43Jn 18:18 Now the slaves and the temple police had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. They were standing there warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, warming himself.
43Jn 18:19 The high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching.
43Jn 18:20 "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus answered him. "I have always taught in the synagogue and in the temple complex, where all the Jews congregate, and I haven't spoken anything in secret.
43Jn 18:21 Why do you question Me? Question those who heard what I told them. Look, they know what I said."
43Jn 18:22 When He had said these things, one of the temple police standing by slapped Jesus, saying, "Is this the way you answer the high priest?"
43Jn 18:23 "If I have spoken wrongly," Jesus answered him, "give evidence about the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit Me?"
43Jn 18:24 Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
43Jn 18:25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, "You aren't one of His disciples too, are you?" He denied it and said, "I am not!"
43Jn 18:26 One of the high priest's slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you with Him in the garden?"
43Jn 18:27 Peter then denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.
43Jn 18:28 Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They did not enter the headquarters themselves; otherwise they would be defiled and unable to eat the Passover.
43Jn 18:29 Then Pilate came out to them and said, "What charge do you bring against this man?"
43Jn 18:30 They answered him, "If this man weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed Him over to you."
43Jn 18:31 So Pilate told them, "Take Him yourselves and judge Him according to your law." "It's not legal for us to put anyone to death," the Jews declared.
43Jn 18:32 They said this so that Jesus' words might be fulfilled signifying what sort of death He was going to die.
43Jn 18:33 Then Pilate went back into the headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"
43Jn 18:34 Jesus answered, "Are you asking this on your own, or have others told you about Me?"
43Jn 18:35 "I'm not a Jew, am I?" Pilate replied. "Your own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?"
43Jn 18:36 "My kingdom is not of this world," said Jesus. "If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I wouldn't be handed over to the Jews. As it is, My kingdom does not have its origin here."
43Jn 18:37 "You are a king then?" Pilate asked. "You say that I'm a king," Jesus replied. "I was born for this, and I have come into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice."
43Jn 18:38 "What is truth?" said Pilate. After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, "I find no grounds for charging Him.
43Jn 18:39 You have a custom that I release one [prisoner] to you at the Passover. So, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
43Jn 18:40 They shouted back, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.
43Jn 19:1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged.
43Jn 19:2 The soldiers also twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on His head, and threw a purple robe around Him.
43Jn 19:3 And they repeatedly came up to Him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and were slapping His face.
43Jn 19:4 Pilate went outside again and said to them, "Look, I'm bringing Him outside to you to let you know I find no grounds for charging Him."
43Jn 19:5 Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
43Jn 19:6 When the chief priests and the temple police saw Him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate responded, "Take Him and crucify Him yourselves, for I find no grounds for charging Him."
43Jn 19:7 "We have a law," the Jews replied to him, "and according to that law He must die, because He made Himself the Son of God."
43Jn 19:8 When Pilate heard this statement, he was more afraid than ever.
43Jn 19:9 He went back into the headquarters and asked Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus did not give him an answer.
43Jn 19:10 So Pilate said to Him, "You're not talking to me? Don't You know that I have the authority to release You and the authority to crucify You?"
43Jn 19:11 "You would have no authority over Me at all," Jesus answered him, "if it hadn't been given you from above. This is why the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin."
43Jn 19:12 From that moment Pilate made every effort to release Him. But the Jews shouted, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Anyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar!"
43Jn 19:13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside. He sat down on the judge's bench in a place called the Stone Pavement (but in Hebrew Gabbatha).
43Jn 19:14 It was the preparation day for the Passover, and it was about six in the morning. Then he told the Jews, "Here is your king!"
43Jn 19:15 But they shouted, "Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him!" Pilate said to them, "Should I crucify your king?" "We have no king but Caesar!" the chief priests answered.
43Jn 19:16 So then, because of them, he handed Him over to be crucified. Therefore they took Jesus away.
43Jn 19:17 Carrying His own cross, He went out to what is called Skull Place, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
43Jn 19:18 There they crucified Him and two others with Him, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.
43Jn 19:19 Pilate also had a sign lettered and put on the cross. The inscription was: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS
43Jn 19:20 Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
43Jn 19:21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but that He said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'"
43Jn 19:22 Pilate replied, "What I have written, I have written."
43Jn 19:23 When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took His clothes and divided them into four parts, a part for each soldier. They also took the tunic, which was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.
43Jn 19:24 So they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but toss for it, to see who gets it." [They did this] to fulfill the Scripture that says: They divided My clothes among themselves, and they cast lots for My clothing. And this is what the soldiers did.
43Jn 19:25 Standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother, His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43Jn 19:26 When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple He loved standing there, He said to His mother, "Woman, here is your son."
43Jn 19:27 Then He said to the disciple, "Here is your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.
43Jn 19:28 After this, when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He said, "I'm thirsty!"
43Jn 19:29 A jar full of sour wine was sitting there; so they fixed a sponge full of sour wine on hyssop and held it up to His mouth.
43Jn 19:30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" Then bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
43Jn 19:31 Since it was the preparation day, the Jews did not want the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special day). They requested that Pilate have the men's legs broken and that [their bodies] be taken away.
43Jn 19:32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been crucified with Him.
43Jn 19:33 When they came to Jesus, they did not break His legs since they saw that He was already dead.
43Jn 19:34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out.
43Jn 19:35 He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows he is telling the truth.
43Jn 19:36 For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: Not one of His bones will be broken.
43Jn 19:37 Also, another Scripture says: They will look at the One they pierced.
43Jn 19:38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus-- but secretly because of his fear of the Jews-- asked Pilate that he might remove Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and took His body away.
43Jn 19:39 Nicodemus (who had previously come to Him at night) also came, bringing a mixture of about 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes.
43Jn 19:40 Then they took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen cloths with the aromatic spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.
43Jn 19:41 There was a garden in the place where He was crucified. A new tomb was in the garden; no one had yet been placed in it.
43Jn 19:42 They place Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation and since the tomb was nearby.
43Jn 20:1 On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark. She saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.
43Jn 20:2 So she ran to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put Him!"
43Jn 20:3 At that, Peter and the other disciple went out, heading for the tomb.
43Jn 20:4 The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and got to the tomb first.
43Jn 20:5 Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, yet he did not go in.
43Jn 20:6 Then, following him, Simon Peter came also. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there.
43Jn 20:7 The wrapping that had been on His head was not lying with the linen cloths but was folded up in a separate place by itself.
43Jn 20:8 The other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, then entered the tomb, saw, and believed.
43Jn 20:9 For they still did not understand the Scripture that He must rise from the dead.
43Jn 20:10 Then the disciples went home again.
43Jn 20:11 But Mary stood outside facing the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she stooped to look into the tomb.
43Jn 20:12 She saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet, where Jesus' body had been lying.
43Jn 20:13 They said to her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "Because they've taken away my Lord," she told them, "and I don't know where they've put Him."
43Jn 20:14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, though she did not know it was Jesus.
43Jn 20:15 "Woman," Jesus said to her, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Supposing He was the gardener, she replied, "Sir, if you've removed Him, tell me where you've put Him, and I will take Him away."
43Jn 20:16 Jesus said, "Mary." Turning around, she said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni!"-- which means "Teacher."
43Jn 20:17 "Don't cling to Me," Jesus told her, "for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to My brothers and tell them that I am ascending to My Father and your Father-- to My God and your God."
43Jn 20:18 Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them what He had said to her.
43Jn 20:19 In the evening of that first day of the week, the disciples were [gathered together] with the doors locked because of their fear of the Jews. Then Jesus came, stood among them, and said to them, "Peace to you!"
43Jn 20:20 Having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. So the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
43Jn 20:21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you."
43Jn 20:22 After saying this, He breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43Jn 20:23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain [the sins of] any, they are retained."
43Jn 20:24 But one of the Twelve, Thomas (called "Twin"), was not with them when Jesus came.
43Jn 20:25 So the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "If I don't see the mark of the nails in His hands, put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe!"
43Jn 20:26 After eight days His disciples were indoors again, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them. He said, "Peace to you!"
43Jn 20:27 Then He said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and observe My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Don't be an unbeliever, but a believer."
43Jn 20:28 Thomas responded to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
43Jn 20:29 Jesus said, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Those who believe without seeing are blessed."
43Jn 20:30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples that are not written in this book.
43Jn 20:31 But these are written so that you may believe Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and by believing you may have life in His name.
43Jn 21:1 After this, Jesus revealed Himself again to His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. He revealed Himself in this way:
43Jn 21:2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called "Twin"), Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two others of His disciples were together.
43Jn 21:3 "I'm going fishing," Simon Peter said to them. "We're coming with you," they told him. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
43Jn 21:4 When daybreak came, Jesus stood on the shore. However, the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
43Jn 21:5 "Men," Jesus called to them, "you don't have any fish, do you?" "No," they answered.
43Jn 21:6 "Cast the net on the right side of the boat," He told them, "and you'll find some." So they did, and they were unable to haul it in because of the large number of fish.
43Jn 21:7 Therefore the disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tied his outer garment around him (for he was stripped) and plunged into the sea.
43Jn 21:8 But since they were not far from land (about 100 yards away), the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish.
43Jn 21:9 When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread.
43Jn 21:10 "Bring some of the fish you've just caught," Jesus told them.
43Jn 21:11 So Simon Peter got up and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish-- 153 of them. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.
43Jn 21:12 "Come and have breakfast," Jesus told them. None of the disciples dared ask Him, "Who are You?" because they knew it was the Lord.
43Jn 21:13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish.
43Jn 21:14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.
43Jn 21:15 When they had eaten breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said to Him, "You know that I love You." "Feed My lambs," He told him.
43Jn 21:16 A second time He asked him, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" "Yes, Lord," he said to Him, "You know that I love You." "Shepherd My sheep," He told him.
43Jn 21:17 He asked him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved that He asked him the third time, "Do you love Me?" He said, "Lord, You know everything! You know that I love You." "Feed My sheep," Jesus said.
43Jn 21:18 "I assure you: When you were young, you would tie your belt and walk wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will tie you and carry you where you don't want to go."
43Jn 21:19 He said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. After saying this, He told him, "Follow Me!"
43Jn 21:20 So Peter turned around and saw the disciple Jesus loved following them. [That disciple] was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is the one that's going to betray You?"
43Jn 21:21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord-- what about him?"
43Jn 21:22 "If I want him to remain until I come," Jesus answered, "what is that to you? As for you, follow Me."
43Jn 21:23 So this report spread to the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not tell him that he would not die, but, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"
43Jn 21:24 This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
43Jn 21:25 And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.
