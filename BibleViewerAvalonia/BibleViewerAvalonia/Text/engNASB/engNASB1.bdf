01Gn 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01Gn 1:2 And the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.
01Gn 1:3 Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
01Gn 1:4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
01Gn 1:5 And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
01Gn 1:6 Then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."
01Gn 1:7 And God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
01Gn 1:8 And God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
01Gn 1:9 Then God said, "Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.
01Gn 1:10 And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:11 Then God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, [and] fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth"; and it was so.
01Gn 1:12 And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
01Gn 1:14 Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
01Gn 1:15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth ";and it was so.
01Gn 1:16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; [He made] the stars also.
01Gn 1:17 And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
01Gn 1:18 and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
01Gn 1:20 Then God said, "Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens."
01Gn 1:21 And God created the great sea monsters, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
01Gn 1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
01Gn 1:24 Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind£º cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind"; and it was so.
01Gn 1:25 And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
01Gn 1:27 And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
01Gn 1:28 And God blessed them; and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
01Gn 1:29 Then God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;
01Gn 1:30 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, [I have given] every green plant for food ";and it was so.
01Gn 1:31 And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
01Gn 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts.
01Gn 2:2 And by the seventh day God completed His work which He had done; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.
01Gn 2:3 Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
01Gn 2:4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
01Gn 2:5 Now no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth; and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
01Gn 2:6 But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
01Gn 2:7 Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
01Gn 2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed.
01Gn 2:9 And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01Gn 2:10 Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.
01Gn 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon; it flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
01Gn 2:12 And the gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
01Gn 2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the whole land of Cush.
01Gn 2:14 And the name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01Gn 2:15 Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.
01Gn 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "From any tree of the garden you may eat freely;
01Gn 2:17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you shall surely die. "
01Gn 2:18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him."
01Gn 2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought [them] to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
01Gn 2:20 And the man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.
01Gn 2:21 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh at that place.
01Gn 2:22 And the LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
01Gn 2:23 And the man said, "This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."
01Gn 2:24 For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.
01Gn 2:25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
01Gn 3:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?"
01Gn 3:2 And the woman said to the serpent, "From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;
01Gn 3:3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, lest you die.' "
01Gn 3:4 And the serpent said to the woman, "You surely shall not die!
01Gn 3:5 "For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
01Gn 3:6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make [one] wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
01Gn 3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
01Gn 3:8 And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
01Gn 3:9 Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
01Gn 3:10 And he said, "I heard the sound of Thee in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself."
01Gn 3:11 And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
01Gn 3:12 And the man said, "The woman whom Thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate."
01Gn 3:13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said," The serpent deceived me, and I ate. "
01Gn 3:14 And the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the field; On your belly shall you go, And dust shall you eat All the days of your life;
01Gn 3:15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel. "
01Gn 3:16 To the woman He said, "I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you shall bring forth children; Yet your desire shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you."
01Gn 3:17 Then to Adam He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ' You shall not eat from it ';Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life.
01Gn 3:18 "Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you; And you shall eat the plants of the field;
01Gn 3:19 By the sweat of your face You shall eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return. "
01Gn 3:20 Now the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all [the] living.
01Gn 3:21 And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.
01Gn 3:22 Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
01Gn 3:23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken.
01Gn 3:24 So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every direction, to guard the way to the tree of life.
01Gn 4:1 Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, "I have gotten a manchild with [the help of] the LORD."
01Gn 4:2 And again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
01Gn 4:3 So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground.
01Gn 4:4 And Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering;
01Gn 4:5 but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.
01Gn 4:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen?
01Gn 4:7 "If you do well, will not [your countenance] be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it."
01Gn 4:8 And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came about when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
01Gn 4:9 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
01Gn 4:10 And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground.
01Gn 4:11 "And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
01Gn 4:12 "When you cultivate the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you; you shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth."
01Gn 4:13 And Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is too great to bear!
01Gn 4:14 "Behold, Thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground; and from Thy face I shall be hidden, and I shall be a vagrant and a wanderer on the earth, and it will come about that whoever finds me will kill me."
01Gn 4:15 So the LORD said to him, "Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should slay him.
01Gn 4:16 Then Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01Gn 4:17 And Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city Enoch, after the name of his son.
01Gn 4:18 Now to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad became the father of Mehujael; and Mehujael became the father of Methushael; and Methushael became the father of Lamech.
01Gn 4:19 And Lamech took to himself two wives£º the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah.
01Gn 4:20 And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and [have] livestock.
01Gn 4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
01Gn 4:22 As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
01Gn 4:23 And Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Listen to my voice, You wives of Lamech, Give heed to my speech, For I have killed a man for wounding me; And a boy for striking me;
01Gn 4:24 If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold. "
01Gn 4:25 And Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for, [she said,] "God has appointed me another offspring in place of Abel; for Cain killed him."
01Gn 4:26 And to Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then [men] began to call upon the name of the LORD.
01Gn 5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
01Gn 5:2 He created them male and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were created.
01Gn 5:3 When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became the father of [a son] in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
01Gn 5:4 Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:5 So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
01Gn 5:6 And Seth lived one hundred and five years, and became the father of Enosh.
01Gn 5:7 Then Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after he became the father of Enosh, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:8 So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
01Gn 5:9 And Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.
01Gn 5:10 Then Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he became the father of Kenan, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:11 So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
01Gn 5:12 And Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel.
01Gn 5:13 Then Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after he became the father of Mahalalel, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:14 So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
01Gn 5:15 And Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.
01Gn 5:16 Then Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Jared, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:17 So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.
01Gn 5:18 And Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch.
01Gn 5:19 Then Jared lived eight hundred years after he became the father of Enoch, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:20 So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.
01Gn 5:21 And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah.
01Gn 5:22 Then Enoch walked with God three hundred years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:23 So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
01Gn 5:24 And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
01Gn 5:25 And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech.
01Gn 5:26 Then Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after he became the father of Lamech, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:27 So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.
01Gn 5:28 And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and became the father of a son.
01Gn 5:29 Now he called his name Noah, saying, "This one shall give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands [arising] from the ground which the LORD has cursed."
01Gn 5:30 Then Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after he became the father of Noah, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:31 So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.
01Gn 5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:1 Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them,
01Gn 6:2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose.
01Gn 6:3 Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."
01Gn 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore [children] to them. Those were the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown.
01Gn 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
01Gn 6:6 And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
01Gn 6:7 And the LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."
01Gn 6:8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
01Gn 6:9 These are [the records of] the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God.
01Gn 6:10 And Noah became the father of three sons£º Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence.
01Gn 6:12 And God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
01Gn 6:13 Then God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I am about to destroy them with the earth.
01Gn 6:14 "Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch.
01Gn 6:15 "And this is how you shall make it£º the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
01Gn 6:16 "You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks.
01Gn 6:17 "And behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish.
01Gn 6:18 "But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark-- you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
01Gn 6:19 "And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every [kind] into the ark, to keep [them] alive with you; they shall be male and female.
01Gn 6:20 "Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every [kind] shall come to you to keep [them] alive.
01Gn 6:21 "And as for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, and gather [it] to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them."
01Gn 6:22 Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
01Gn 7:1 Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household; for you [alone] I have seen [to be] righteous before Me in this time.
01Gn 7:2 "You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female;
01Gn 7:3 also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
01Gn 7:4 "For after seven more days, I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made."
01Gn 7:5 And Noah did according to all that the LORD had commanded him.
01Gn 7:6 Now Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of water came upon the earth.
01Gn 7:7 Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood.
01Gn 7:8 Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground,
01Gn 7:9 there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
01Gn 7:10 And it came about after the seven days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth.
01Gn 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.
01Gn 7:12 And the rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
01Gn 7:13 On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark,
01Gn 7:14 they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds.
01Gn 7:15 So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life.
01Gn 7:16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed [it] behind him.
01Gn 7:17 Then the flood came upon the earth for forty days; and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth.
01Gn 7:18 And the water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
01Gn 7:19 And the water prevailed more and more upon the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered.
01Gn 7:20 The water prevailed fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered.
01Gn 7:21 And all flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind;
01Gn 7:22 of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died.
01Gn 7:23 Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.
01Gn 7:24 And the water prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
01Gn 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided.
01Gn 8:2 Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained;
01Gn 8:3 and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of one hundred and fifty days the water decreased.
01Gn 8:4 And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.
01Gn 8:5 And the water decreased steadily until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
01Gn 8:6 Then it came about at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;
01Gn 8:7 and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth.
01Gn 8:8 Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land;
01Gn 8:9 but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him into the ark; for the water was on the surface of all the earth. Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself.
01Gn 8:10 So he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark.
01Gn 8:11 And the dove came to him toward evening; and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth.
01Gn 8:12 Then he waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again.
01Gn 8:13 Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first [month,] on the first of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried up.
01Gn 8:14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
01Gn 8:15 Then God spoke to Noah, saying,
01Gn 8:16 "Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
01Gn 8:17 "Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth."
01Gn 8:18 So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
01Gn 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark.
01Gn 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
01Gn 8:21 And the LORD smelled the soothing aroma; and the LORD said to Himself, "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done.
01Gn 8:22 "While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, And cold and heat, And summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease."
01Gn 9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
01Gn 9:2 "And the fear of you and the terror of you shall be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given.
01Gn 9:3 "Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as [I gave] the green plant.
01Gn 9:4 "Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, [that is,] its blood.
01Gn 9:5 "And surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from [every] man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man.
01Gn 9:6 "Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man.
01Gn 9:7 "And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it."
01Gn 9:8 Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
01Gn 9:9 "Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you;
01Gn 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
01Gn 9:11 "And I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth."
01Gn 9:12 And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all successive generations;
01Gn 9:13 I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.
01Gn 9:14 "And it shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
01Gn 9:15 and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh.
01Gn 9:16 "When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
01Gn 9:17 And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth."
01Gn 9:18 Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.
01Gn 9:19 These three [were] the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was populated.
01Gn 9:20 Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard.
01Gn 9:21 And he drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent.
01Gn 9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
01Gn 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness.
01Gn 9:24 When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him.
01Gn 9:25 So he said, "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers."
01Gn 9:26 He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
01Gn 9:27 "May God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant."
01Gn 9:28 And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood.
01Gn 9:29 So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
01Gn 10:1 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood.
01Gn 10:2 The sons of Japheth [were] Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
01Gn 10:3 And the sons of Gomer [were] Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
01Gn 10:4 And the sons of Javan [were] Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
01Gn 10:5 From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
01Gn 10:6 And the sons of Ham [were] Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.
01Gn 10:7 And the sons of Cush [were] Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah [were] Sheba and Dedan.
01Gn 10:8 Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth.
01Gn 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD."
01Gn 10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
01Gn 10:11 From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-ir and Calah,
01Gn 10:12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
01Gn 10:13 And Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
01Gn 10:14 and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
01Gn 10:15 And Canaan became the father of Sidon, his first-born, and Heth
01Gn 10:16 and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite
01Gn 10:17 and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite
01Gn 10:18 and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.
01Gn 10:19 And the territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01Gn 10:20 These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations.
01Gn 10:21 And also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, [and] the older brother of Japheth, children were born.
01Gn 10:22 The sons of Shem [were] Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
01Gn 10:23 And the sons of Aram [were] Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
01Gn 10:24 And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
01Gn 10:25 And two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one [was] Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name [was] Joktan.
01Gn 10:26 And Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
01Gn 10:27 and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
01Gn 10:28 and Obal and Abimael and Sheba
01Gn 10:29 and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
01Gn 10:30 Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.
01Gn 10:31 These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.
01Gn 10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.
01Gn 11:1 Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
01Gn 11:2 And it came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
01Gn 11:3 And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn [them] thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
01Gn 11:4 And they said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top [will reach] into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name; lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."
01Gn 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
01Gn 11:6 And the LORD said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them.
01Gn 11:7 "Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
01Gn 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
01Gn 11:9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.
01Gn 11:10 These are [the records of] the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old, and became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood;
01Gn 11:11 and Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:12 And Arpachshad lived thirty-five years, and became the father of Shelah;
01Gn 11:13 and Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Shelah, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber;
01Gn 11:15 and Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:16 And Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg;
01Gn 11:17 and Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu;
01Gn 11:19 and Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he became the father of Reu, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:20 And Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug;
01Gn 11:21 and Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he became the father of Serug, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor;
01Gn 11:23 and Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:24 And Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah;
01Gn 11:25 and Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and he had [other] sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
01Gn 11:27 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot.
01Gn 11:28 And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
01Gn 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.
01Gn 11:30 And Sarai was barren; she had no child.
01Gn 11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan; and they went as far as Haran, and settled there.
01Gn 11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.
01Gn 12:1 Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you;
01Gn 12:2 And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing;
01Gn 12:3 And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. "
01Gn 12:4 So Abram went forth as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
01Gn 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to the land of Canaan.
01Gn 12:6 And Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanite [was] then in the land.
01Gn 12:7 And the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your descendants I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him.
01Gn 12:8 Then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
01Gn 12:9 And Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev.
01Gn 12:10 Now there was a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
01Gn 12:11 And it came about when he came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman;
01Gn 12:12 and it will come about when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife'; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.
01Gn 12:13 "Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you."
01Gn 12:14 And it came about when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
01Gn 12:15 And Pharaoh's officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
01Gn 12:16 Therefore he treated Abram well for her sake; and gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels.
01Gn 12:17 But the LORD struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
01Gn 12:18 Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
01Gn 12:19 "Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife, take her and go."
01Gn 12:20 And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him; and they escorted him away, with his wife and all that belonged to him.
01Gn 13:1 So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, he and his wife and all that belonged to him; and Lot with him.
01Gn 13:2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold.
01Gn 13:3 And he went on his journeys from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
01Gn 13:4 to the place of the altar, which he had made there formerly; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
01Gn 13:5 Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
01Gn 13:6 And the land could not sustain them while dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together.
01Gn 13:7 And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land.
01Gn 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.
01Gn 13:9 "Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me£º if [to] the left, then I will go to the right; or if [to] the right, then I will go to the left."
01Gn 13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere-- [this was] before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah-- like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar.
01Gn 13:11 So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they separated from each other.
01Gn 13:12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the valley, and moved his tents as far as Sodom.
01Gn 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the LORD.
01Gn 13:14 And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, " Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;
01Gn 13:15 for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.
01Gn 13:16 "And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered.
01Gn 13:17 "Arise, walk about the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to you."
01Gn 13:18 Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
01Gn 14:1 And it came about in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
01Gn 14:2 [that] they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01Gn 14:3 All these came as allies to the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
01Gn 14:4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01Gn 14:5 And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
01Gn 14:7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and conquered all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
01Gn 14:8 And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they arrayed for battle against them in the valley of Siddim,
01Gn 14:9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar-- four kings against five.
01Gn 14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell into them. But those who survived fled to the hill country.
01Gn 14:11 Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply, and departed.
01Gn 14:12 And they also took Lot, Abram's nephew, and his possessions and departed, for he was living in Sodom.
01Gn 14:13 Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were allies with Abram.
01Gn 14:14 And when Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01Gn 14:15 And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
01Gn 14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot with his possessions, and also the women, and the people.
01Gn 14:17 Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
01Gn 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.
01Gn 14:19 And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth;
01Gn 14:20 And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your enemies into your hand. "And he gave him a tenth of all.
01Gn 14:21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give the people to me and take the goods for yourself."
01Gn 14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
01Gn 14:23 that I will not take a thread or a sandal thong or anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
01Gn 14:24 "I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share."
01Gn 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great."
01Gn 15:2 And Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"
01Gn 15:3 And Abram said, "Since Thou hast given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir."
01Gn 15:4 Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir; but one who shall come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir."
01Gn 15:5 And He took him outside and said, "Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." And He said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
01Gn 15:6 Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.
01Gn 15:7 And He said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it."
01Gn 15:8 And he said, "O Lord GOD, how may I know that I shall possess it?"
01Gn 15:9 So He said to him, "Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
01Gn 15:10 Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds.
01Gn 15:11 And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
01Gn 15:12 Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror [and] great darkness fell upon him.
01Gn 15:13 And [God] said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.
01Gn 15:14 "But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve; and afterward they will come out with many possessions.
01Gn 15:15 "And as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age.
01Gn 15:16 "Then in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete."
01Gn 15:17 And it came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, [there appeared] a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces.
01Gn 15:18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates£º
01Gn 15:19 the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
01Gn 15:20 and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
01Gn 15:21 and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite. "
01Gn 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife had borne him no [children,] and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.
01Gn 16:2 So Sarai said to Abram, "Now behold, the LORD has prevented me from bearing [children.] Please go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children through her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
01Gn 16:3 And after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife.
01Gn 16:4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her sight.
01Gn 16:5 And Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done me be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms; but when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her sight. May the LORD judge between you and me."
01Gn 16:6 But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her what is good in your sight." So Sarai treated her harshly, and she fled from her presence.
01Gn 16:7 Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.
01Gn 16:8 And he said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where have you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai."
01Gn 16:9 Then the angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority."
01Gn 16:10 Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, "I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they shall be too many to count."
01Gn 16:11 The angel of the LORD said to her further, "Behold, you are with child, And you shall bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction.
01Gn 16:12 "And he will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand [will be] against everyone, And everyone's hand [will be] against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers."
01Gn 16:13 Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "Thou art a God who sees"; for she said, "Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?"
01Gn 16:14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
01Gn 16:15 So Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
01Gn 16:16 And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
01Gn 17:1 Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be blameless.
01Gn 17:2 "And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will multiply you exceedingly."
01Gn 17:3 And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
01Gn 17:4 "As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, And you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
01Gn 17:5 "No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name shall be Abraham; For I will make you the father of a multitude of nations.
01Gn 17:6 "And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.
01Gn 17:7 "And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.
01Gn 17:8 "And I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
01Gn 17:9 God said further to Abraham, "Now as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.
01Gn 17:10 "This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you£º every male among you shall be circumcised.
01Gn 17:11 "And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.
01Gn 17:12 "And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, a [servant] who is born in the house or who is bought with money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants.
01Gn 17:13 "A [servant] who is born in your house or who is bought with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall My covenant be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
01Gn 17:14 "But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant."
01Gn 17:15 Then God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah [shall be] her name.
01Gn 17:16 "And I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall come from her."
01Gn 17:17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, " Will a child be born to a man one hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear [a child?] "
01Gn 17:18 And Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before Thee!"
01Gn 17:19 But God said, "No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
01Gn 17:20 "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
01Gn 17:21 "But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year."
01Gn 17:22 And when He finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
01Gn 17:23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all [the servants] who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the very same day, as God had said to him.
01Gn 17:24 Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01Gn 17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01Gn 17:26 In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
01Gn 17:27 And all the men of his household, who were born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
01Gn 18:1 Now the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day.
01Gn 18:2 And when he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three men were standing opposite him; and when he saw [them,] he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the earth,
01Gn 18:3 and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by.
01Gn 18:4 "Please let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree;
01Gn 18:5 and I will bring a piece of bread, that you may refresh yourselves; after that you may go on, since you have visited your servant. "And they said," So do, as you have said. "
01Gn 18:6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead [it,] and make bread cakes."
01Gn 18:7 Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a tender and choice calf, and gave [it] to the servant; and he hurried to prepare it.
01Gn 18:8 And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and placed [it] before them; and he was standing by them under the tree as they ate.
01Gn 18:9 Then they said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, " Behold, in the tent. "
01Gn 18:10 And he said, "I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him.
01Gn 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past childbearing.
01Gn 18:12 And Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
01Gn 18:13 And the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Shall I indeed bear [a child,] when I am [so] old?'
01Gn 18:14 "Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son."
01Gn 18:15 Sarah denied [it] however, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. And He said, "No, but you did laugh."
01Gn 18:16 Then the men rose up from there, and looked down toward Sodom; and Abraham was walking with them to send them off.
01Gn 18:17 And the LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
01Gn 18:18 since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed?
01Gn 18:19 "For I have chosen him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him."
01Gn 18:20 And the LORD said, "The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave.
01Gn 18:21 "I will go down now, and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know."
01Gn 18:22 Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham was still standing before the LORD.
01Gn 18:23 And Abraham came near and said, "Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01Gn 18:24 "Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou indeed sweep [it] away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?
01Gn 18:25 "Far be it from Thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are [treated] alike. Far be it from Thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?"
01Gn 18:26 So the LORD said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account."
01Gn 18:27 And Abraham answered and said, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord, although I am [but] dust and ashes.
01Gn 18:28 "Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, wilt Thou destroy the whole city because of five?" And He said, "I will not destroy [it] if I find forty-five there."
01Gn 18:29 And he spoke to Him yet again and said, "Suppose forty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do [it] on account of the forty."
01Gn 18:30 Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak; suppose thirty are found there?" And He said, "I will not do [it] if I find thirty there."
01Gn 18:31 And he said, "Now behold, I have ventured to speak to the Lord; suppose twenty are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy [it] on account of the twenty."
01Gn 18:32 Then he said, "Oh may the Lord not be angry, and I shall speak only this once; suppose ten are found there?" And He said, "I will not destroy [it] on account of the ten."
01Gn 18:33 And as soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the LORD departed; and Abraham returned to his place.
01Gn 19:1 Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw [them,] he rose to meet them and bowed down [with his] face to the ground.
01Gn 19:2 And he said, "Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way." They said however, "No, but we shall spend the night in the square."
01Gn 19:3 Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
01Gn 19:4 Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
01Gn 19:5 and they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them."
01Gn 19:6 But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him,
01Gn 19:7 and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.
01Gn 19:8 "Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof."
01Gn 19:9 But they said, "Stand aside." Furthermore, they said, "This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them." So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door.
01Gn 19:10 But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
01Gn 19:11 And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied [themselves trying] to find the doorway.
01Gn 19:12 Then the men said to Lot, "Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring [them] out of the place;
01Gn 19:13 for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy it. "
01Gn 19:14 And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, "Up, get out of this place, for the LORD will destroy the city." But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
01Gn 19:15 And when morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Up, take your wife and your two daughters, who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city."
01Gn 19:16 But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the LORD [> was] upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city.
01Gn 19:17 And it came about when they had brought them outside, that one said, "Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, lest you be swept away."
01Gn 19:18 But Lot said to them, "Oh no, my lords!
01Gn 19:19 "Now behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness, which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest the disaster overtake me and I die;
01Gn 19:20 now behold, this town is near [enough] to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) that my life may be saved. "
01Gn 19:21 And he said to him, "Behold, I grant you this request also, not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken.
01Gn 19:22 "Hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar.
01Gn 19:23 The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
01Gn 19:24 Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven,
01Gn 19:25 and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
01Gn 19:26 But his wife, from behind him, looked [back;] and she became a pillar of salt.
01Gn 19:27 Now Abraham arose early in the morning [and went] to the place where he had stood before the LORD;
01Gn 19:28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace.
01Gn 19:29 Thus it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
01Gn 19:30 And Lot went up from Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to stay in Zoar; and he stayed in a cave, he and his two daughters.
01Gn 19:31 Then the first-born said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth.
01Gn 19:32 "Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father."
01Gn 19:33 So they made their father drink wine that night, and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
01Gn 19:34 And it came about on the morrow, that the first-born said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father."
01Gn 19:35 So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
01Gn 19:36 Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
01Gn 19:37 And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
01Gn 19:38 And as for the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi; he is the father of the sons of Ammon to this day.
01Gn 20:1 Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev, and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.
01Gn 20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
01Gn 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, " Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married. "
01Gn 20:4 Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, "Lord, wilt Thou slay a nation, even [though] blameless?
01Gn 20:5 "Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this."
01Gn 20:6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also kept you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.
01Gn 20:7 "Now therefore, restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not restore [her,] know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours."
01Gn 20:8 So Abimelech arose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly frightened.
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done."
01Gn 20:10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you encountered, that you have done this thing?"
01Gn 20:11 And Abraham said, "Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place; and they will kill me because of my wife.
01Gn 20:12 "Besides, she actually is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife;
01Gn 20:13 and it came about, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is the kindness which you will show to me£º everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."' "
01Gn 20:14 Abimelech then took sheep and oxen and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored his wife Sarah to him.
01Gn 20:15 And Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please."
01Gn 20:16 And to Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is your vindication before all who are with you, and before all men you are cleared."
01Gn 20:17 And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, so that they bore [children.]
01Gn 20:18 For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
01Gn 21:1 Then the LORD took note of Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah as He had promised.
01Gn 21:2 So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.
01Gn 21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
01Gn 21:4 Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
01Gn 21:5 Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01Gn 21:6 And Sarah said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me."
01Gn 21:7 And she said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
01Gn 21:8 And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
01Gn 21:9 Now Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
01Gn 21:10 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac."
01Gn 21:11 And the matter distressed Abraham greatly because of his son.
01Gn 21:12 But God said to Abraham, "Do not be distressed because of the lad and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her, for through Isaac your descendants shall be named.
01Gn 21:13 "And of the son of the maid I will make a nation also, because he is your descendant."
01Gn 21:14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave [them] to Hagar, putting [them] on her shoulder, and [gave her] the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba.
01Gn 21:15 And the water in the skin was used up, and she left the boy under one of the bushes.
01Gn 21:16 Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, "Do not let me see the boy die." And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice and wept.
01Gn 21:17 And God heard the lad crying; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, "What is the matter with you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
01Gn 21:18 "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him by the hand; for I will make a great nation of him."
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink.
01Gn 21:20 And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.
01Gn 21:21 And he lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
01Gn 21:22 Now it came about at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do;
01Gn 21:23 now therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, or with my offspring, or with my posterity; but according to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall show to me, and to the land in which you have sojourned. "
01Gn 21:24 And Abraham said, "I swear it."
01Gn 21:25 But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well of water which the servants of Abimelech had seized.
01Gn 21:26 And Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; neither did you tell me, nor did I hear of it until today."
01Gn 21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and the two of them made a covenant.
01Gn 21:28 Then Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
01Gn 21:29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs mean, which you have set by themselves?"
01Gn 21:30 And he said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand in order that it may be a witness to me, that I dug this well."
01Gn 21:31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba; because there the two of them took an oath.
01Gn 21:32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines.
01Gn 21:33 And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
01Gn 21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
01Gn 22:1 Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am."
01Gn 22:2 And He said, "Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah; and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you."
01Gn 22:3 So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
01Gn 22:4 On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
01Gn 22:5 And Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship and return to you."
01Gn 22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
01Gn 22:7 And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
01Gn 22:8 And Abraham said, "God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." So the two of them walked on together.
01Gn 22:9 Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there, and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
01Gn 22:10 And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
01Gn 22:11 But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, " Abraham, Abraham! "And he said," Here I am. "
01Gn 22:12 And he said, "Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me."
01Gn 22:13 Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.
01Gn 22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, "In the mount of the LORD it will be provided."
01Gn 22:15 Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
01Gn 22:16 and said, "By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,
01Gn 22:17 indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.
01Gn 22:18 "And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice."
01Gn 22:19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba.
01Gn 22:20 Now it came about after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor£º
01Gn 22:21 Uz his first-born and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram
01Gn 22:22 and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel. "
01Gn 22:23 And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah£º these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
01Gn 22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
01Gn 23:1 Now Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; [these were] the years of the life of Sarah.
01Gn 23:2 And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
01Gn 23:3 Then Abraham rose from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
01Gn 23:4 "I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me a burial site among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
01Gn 23:5 And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
01Gn 23:6 "Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave for burying your dead."
01Gn 23:7 So Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.
01Gn 23:8 And he spoke with them, saying, "If it is your wish [for me] to bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and approach Ephron the son of Zohar for me,
01Gn 23:9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he owns, which is at the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in your presence for a burial site. "
01Gn 23:10 Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the sons of Heth; [even] of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,
01Gn 23:11 "No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."
01Gn 23:12 And Abraham bowed before the people of the land.
01Gn 23:13 And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, "If you will only please listen to me; I will give the price of the field, accept [it] from me, that I may bury my dead there."
01Gn 23:14 Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
01Gn 23:15 "My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? So bury your dead."
01Gn 23:16 And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, commercial standard.
01Gn 23:17 So Ephron's field, which was in Machpelah, which faced Mamre, the field and cave which was in it, and all the trees which were in the field, that were within all the confines of its border, were deeded over
01Gn 23:18 to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
01Gn 23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah facing Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 23:20 So the field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded over to Abraham for a burial site by the sons of Heth.
01Gn 24:1 Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in every way.
01Gn 24:2 And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, "Please place your hand under my thigh,
01Gn 24:3 and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,
01Gn 24:4 but you shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac. "
01Gn 24:5 And the servant said to him, "Suppose the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?"
01Gn 24:6 Then Abraham said to him, "Beware lest you take my son back there!
01Gn 24:7 "The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'To your descendants I will give this land,' He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.
01Gn 24:8 "But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath; only do not take my son back there."
01Gn 24:9 So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
01Gn 24:10 Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master's in his hand; and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
01Gn 24:11 And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.
01Gn 24:12 And he said, "O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham.
01Gn 24:13 "Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;
01Gn 24:14 now may it be that the girl to whom I say, 'Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and who answers, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also';-- [may] she [be the one] whom Thou hast appointed for Thy servant Isaac; and by this I shall know that Thou hast shown lovingkindness to my master. "
01Gn 24:15 And it came about before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.
01Gn 24:16 And the girl was very beautiful, a virgin, and no man had had relations with her; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar, and came up.
01Gn 24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar."
01Gn 24:18 And she said, "Drink, my lord"; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink.
01Gn 24:19 Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, "I will draw also for your camels until they have finished drinking."
01Gn 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
01Gn 24:21 Meanwhile, the man was gazing at her in silence, to know whether the LORD had made his journey successful or not.
01Gn 24:22 Then it came about, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold,
01Gn 24:23 and said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to lodge in your father's house?"
01Gn 24:24 And she said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
01Gn 24:25 Again she said to him, "We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to lodge in."
01Gn 24:26 Then the man bowed low and worshiped the LORD.
01Gn 24:27 And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His truth toward my master; as for me, the LORD has guided me in the way to the house of my master's brothers."
01Gn 24:28 Then the girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.
01Gn 24:30 And it came about that when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me," he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
01Gn 24:31 And he said, "Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?"
01Gn 24:32 So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
01Gn 24:33 But when [food] was set before him to eat, he said, "I will not eat until I have told my business." And he said, "Speak on."
01Gn 24:34 So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
01Gn 24:35 "And the LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 24:36 "Now Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master in her old age; and he has given him all that he has.
01Gn 24:37 "And my master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;
01Gn 24:38 but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son. '
01Gn 24:39 "And I said to my master, 'Suppose the woman does not follow me.'
01Gn 24:40 "And he said to me, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives, and from my father's house;
01Gn 24:41 then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath. '
01Gn 24:42 "So I came today to the spring, and said, 'O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now Thou wilt make my journey on which I go successful;
01Gn 24:43 behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar";
01Gn 24:44 and she will say to me, "You drink, and I will draw for your camels also"; let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son. '
01Gn 24:45 "Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew; and I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'
01Gn 24:46 "And she quickly lowered her jar from her [shoulder,] and said, 'Drink, and I will water your camels also'; so I drank, and she watered the camels also.
01Gn 24:47 "Then I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' And she said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him'; and I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
01Gn 24:48 "And I bowed low and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
01Gn 24:49 "So now if you are going to deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, let me know, that I may turn to the right hand or the left."
01Gn 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, "The matter comes from the LORD; [so] we cannot speak to you bad or good.
01Gn 24:51 "Behold, Rebekah is before you, take [her] and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has spoken."
01Gn 24:52 And it came about when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed himself to the ground before the LORD.
01Gn 24:53 And the servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
01Gn 24:54 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
01Gn 24:55 But her brother and her mother said, "Let the girl stay with us [a few] days, say ten; afterward she may go."
01Gn 24:56 And he said to them, "Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
01Gn 24:57 And they said, "We will call the girl and consult her wishes."
01Gn 24:58 Then they called Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."
01Gn 24:59 Thus they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham's servant and his men.
01Gn 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "May you, our sister, Become thousands of ten thousands, And may your descendants possess The gate of those who hate them."
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.
01Gn 24:62 Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the Negev.
01Gn 24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.
01Gn 24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from the camel.
01Gn 24:65 And she said to the servant, "Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?" And the servant said, "He is my master." Then she took her veil and covered herself.
01Gn 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
01Gn 24:67 Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her; thus Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
01Gn 25:1 Now Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
01Gn 25:2 And she bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
01Gn 25:3 And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim.
01Gn 25:4 And the sons of Midian [were] Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these [were] the sons of Keturah.
01Gn 25:5 Now Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac;
01Gn 25:6 but to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the east.
01Gn 25:7 And these are all the years of Abraham's life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years.
01Gn 25:8 And Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old age, an old man and satisfied [with life;] and he was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:9 Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,
01Gn 25:10 the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.
01Gn 25:11 And it came about after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi.
01Gn 25:12 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, bore to Abraham;
01Gn 25:13 and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth£º Nebaioth, the first-born of Ishmael, and Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam
01Gn 25:14 and Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
01Gn 25:15 Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
01Gn 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages, and by their camps; twelve princes according to their tribes.
01Gn 25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:18 And they settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled in defiance of all his relatives.
01Gn 25:19 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son£º Abraham became the father of Isaac;
01Gn 25:20 and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
01Gn 25:21 And Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD answered him and Rebekah his wife conceived.
01Gn 25:22 But the children struggled together within her; and she said, "If it is so, why then am I [this way?]" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
01Gn 25:23 And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb; And two peoples shall be separated from your body; And one people shall be stronger than the other; And the older shall serve the younger."
01Gn 25:24 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
01Gn 25:25 Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.
01Gn 25:26 And afterward his brother came forth with his hand holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob; and Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.
01Gn 25:27 When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents.
01Gn 25:28 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he had a taste for game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01Gn 25:29 And when Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished;
01Gn 25:30 and Esau said to Jacob, "Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.
01Gn 25:31 But Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright."
01Gn 25:32 And Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die; so of what [use] then is the birthright to me?"
01Gn 25:33 And Jacob said, "First swear to me"; so he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
01Gn 26:1 Now there was a famine in the land, besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines.
01Gn 26:2 And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I shall tell you.
01Gn 26:3 "Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham.
01Gn 26:4 "And I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;
01Gn 26:5 because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws. "
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac lived in Gerar.
01Gn 26:7 When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "my wife," [thinking,] "the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful."
01Gn 26:8 And it came about, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was caressing his wife Rebekah.
01Gn 26:9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, certainly she is your wife! How then did you say, 'She is my sister'?" And Isaac said to him, " Because I said, 'Lest I die on account of her.' "
01Gn 26:10 And Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
01Gn 26:11 So Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
01Gn 26:12 Now Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him,
01Gn 26:13 and the man became rich, and continued to grow richer until he became very wealthy;
01Gn 26:14 for he had possessions of flocks and herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.
01Gn 26:15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with earth.
01Gn 26:16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go away from us, for you are too powerful for us."
01Gn 26:17 And Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there.
01Gn 26:18 Then Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the same names which his father had given them.
01Gn 26:19 But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water,
01Gn 26:20 the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him.
01Gn 26:21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over it too, so he named it Sitnah.
01Gn 26:22 And he moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he named it Rehoboth, for he said, "At last the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
01Gn 26:23 Then he went up from there to Beersheba.
01Gn 26:24 And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham; Do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you, and multiply your descendants, For the sake of My servant Abraham."
01Gn 26:25 So he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.
01Gn 26:26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with his adviser Ahuzzath, and Phicol the commander of his army.
01Gn 26:27 And Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
01Gn 26:28 And they said, "We see plainly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, [even] between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
01Gn 26:29 that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD. '"
01Gn 26:30 Then he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
01Gn 26:31 And in the morning they arose early and exchanged oaths; then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace.
01Gn 26:32 Now it came about on the same day, that Isaac's servants came in and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."
01Gn 26:33 So he called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
01Gn 26:34 And when Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;
01Gn 26:35 and they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
01Gn 27:1 Now it came about, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called his older son Esau and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Here I am."
01Gn 27:2 And Isaac said, "Behold now, I am old [and] I do not know the day of my death.
01Gn 27:3 "Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me;
01Gn 27:4 and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die. "
01Gn 27:5 And Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring [home,]
01Gn 27:6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Behold, I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,
01Gn 27:7 'Bring me [some] game and prepare a savory dish for me, that I may eat, and bless you in the presence of the LORD before my death.'
01Gn 27:8 "Now therefore, my son, listen to me as I command you.
01Gn 27:9 "Go now to the flock and bring me two choice kids from there, that I may prepare them [as] a savory dish for your father, such as he loves.
01Gn 27:10 "Then you shall bring [it] to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
01Gn 27:11 And Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man.
01Gn 27:12 "Perhaps my father will feel me, then I shall be as a deceiver in his sight; and I shall bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing."
01Gn 27:13 But his mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get [them] for me."
01Gn 27:14 So he went and got [them,] and brought [them] to his mother; and his mother made savory food such as his father loved.
01Gn 27:15 Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
01Gn 27:16 And she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
01Gn 27:17 She also gave the savory food and the bread, which she had made, to her son Jacob.
01Gn 27:18 Then he came to his father and said, "My father." And he said, " Here I am. Who are you, my son? "
01Gn 27:19 And Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your first-born; I have done as you told me. Get up, please, sit and eat of my game, that you may bless me."
01Gn 27:20 And Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have [it] so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the LORD your God caused [it] to happen to me."
01Gn 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come close, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
01Gn 27:22 So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, " The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau. "
01Gn 27:23 And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.
01Gn 27:24 And he said, "Are you really my son Esau?" And he said, "I am."
01Gn 27:25 So he said, "Bring [it] to me, and I will eat of my son's game, that I may bless you." And he brought [it] to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank.
01Gn 27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Please come close and kiss me, my son."
01Gn 27:27 So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, "See, the smell of my son Is like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed;
01Gn 27:28 Now may God give you of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And an abundance of grain and new wine;
01Gn 27:29 May peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you; Be master of your brothers, And may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And blessed be those who bless you. "
01Gn 27:30 Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had hardly gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
01Gn 27:31 Then he also made savory food, and brought it to his father; and he said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."
01Gn 27:32 And Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your son, your first-born, Esau."
01Gn 27:33 Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who was he then that hunted game and brought [it] to me, so that I ate of all [of it] before you came, and blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed."
01Gn 27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, [even] me also, O my father!"
01Gn 27:35 And he said, "Your brother came deceitfully, and has taken away your blessing."
01Gn 27:36 Then he said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." And he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
01Gn 27:37 But Isaac answered and said to Esau, "Behold, I have made him your master, and all his relatives I have given to him as servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. Now as for you then, what can I do, my son?"
01Gn 27:38 And Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, [even] me also, O my father." So Esau lifted his voice and wept.
01Gn 27:39 Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, "Behold, away from the fertility of the earth shall be your dwelling, And away from the dew of heaven from above.
01Gn 27:40 "And by your sword you shall live, And your brother you shall serve; But it shall come about when you become restless, That you shall break his yoke from your neck."
01Gn 27:41 So Esau bore a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
01Gn 27:42 Now when the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent and called her younger son Jacob, and said to him, "Behold your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you, [by planning] to kill you.
01Gn 27:43 "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise, flee to Haran, to my brother Laban!
01Gn 27:44 "And stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury subsides,
01Gn 27:45 until your brother's anger against you subsides, and he forgets what you did to him. Then I shall send and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day? "
01Gn 27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?"
01Gn 28:1 So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
01Gn 28:2 "Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and from there take to yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
01Gn 28:3 "And may God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
01Gn 28:4 "May He also give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you; that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham."
01Gn 28:5 Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
01Gn 28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take to himself a wife from there, [and that] when he blessed him he charged him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,"
01Gn 28:7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram.
01Gn 28:8 So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased his father Isaac;
01Gn 28:9 and Esau went to Ishmael, and married, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 28:10 Then Jacob departed from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
01Gn 28:11 And he came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and lay down in that place.
01Gn 28:12 And he had a dream, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth with its top reaching to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
01Gn 28:13 And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your descendants.
01Gn 28:14 "Your descendants shall also be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
01Gn 28:15 "And behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
01Gn 28:16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it."
01Gn 28:17 And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
01Gn 28:18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on its top.
01Gn 28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel; however, previously the name of the city had been Luz.
01Gn 28:20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear,
01Gn 28:21 and I return to my father's house in safety, then the LORD will be my God.
01Gn 28:22 "And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God's house; and of all that Thou dost give me I will surely give a tenth to Thee."
01Gn 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the sons of the east.
01Gn 29:2 And he looked, and saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it, for from that well they watered the flocks. Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large.
01Gn 29:3 When all the flocks were gathered there, they would then roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the mouth of the well.
01Gn 29:4 And Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Haran."
01Gn 29:5 And he said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" And they said, "We know [him.]"
01Gn 29:6 And he said to them, "Is it well with him?" And they said, "It is well, and behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep."
01Gn 29:7 And he said, "Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them."
01Gn 29:8 But they said, "We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."
01Gn 29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
01Gn 29:10 And it came about, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went up, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
01Gn 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted his voice and wept.
01Gn 29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.
01Gn 29:13 So it came about, when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Then he related to Laban all these things.
01Gn 29:14 And Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh." And he stayed with him a month.
01Gn 29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"
01Gn 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
01Gn 29:17 And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of form and face.
01Gn 29:18 Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."
01Gn 29:19 And Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man; stay with me."
01Gn 29:20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her.
01Gn 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give [me] my wife, for my time is completed, that I may go in to her."
01Gn 29:22 And Laban gathered all the men of the place, and made a feast.
01Gn 29:23 Now it came about in the evening that he took his daughter Leah, and brought her to him; and [Jacob] went in to her.
01Gn 29:24 Laban also gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maid.
01Gn 29:25 So it came about in the morning that, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?"
01Gn 29:26 But Laban said, "It is not the practice in our place, to marry off the younger before the first-born.
01Gn 29:27 "Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you shall serve with me for another seven years."
01Gn 29:28 And Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
01Gn 29:29 Laban also gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.
01Gn 29:30 So [Jacob] went in to Rachel also, and indeed he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.
01Gn 29:31 Now the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
01Gn 29:32 And Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she said, "Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."
01Gn 29:33 Then she conceived again and bore a son and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me this [son] also." So she named him Simeon.
01Gn 29:34 And she conceived again and bore a son and said, "Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore he was named Levi.
01Gn 29:35 And she conceived again and bore a son and said, "This time I will praise the LORD." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
01Gn 30:1 Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die."
01Gn 30:2 Then Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he said, "Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
01Gn 30:3 And she said, "Here is my maid Bilhah, go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children."
01Gn 30:4 So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
01Gn 30:5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
01Gn 30:6 Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son." Therefore she named him Dan.
01Gn 30:7 And Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:8 So Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, [and] I have indeed prevailed." And she named him Naphtali.
01Gn 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01Gn 30:10 And Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
01Gn 30:11 Then Leah said, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad.
01Gn 30:12 And Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:13 Then Leah said, "Happy am I! For women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
01Gn 30:14 Now in the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:15 But she said to her, "Is it a small matter for you to take my husband? And would you take my son's mandrakes also?" So Rachel said, "Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:16 When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, then Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.
01Gn 30:17 And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
01Gn 30:18 Then Leah said, "God has given me my wages, because I gave my maid to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
01Gn 30:19 And Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
01Gn 30:20 Then Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
01Gn 30:21 And afterward she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.
01Gn 30:23 So she conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away my reproach."
01Gn 30:24 And she named him Joseph, saying, "May the LORD give me another son."
01Gn 30:25 Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.
01Gn 30:26 "Give [me] my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me depart; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you."
01Gn 30:27 But Laban said to him, "If now it pleases you, [stay with me;] I have divined that the LORD has blessed me on your account."
01Gn 30:28 And he continued, "Name me your wages, and I will give it."
01Gn 30:29 But he said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you and how your cattle have fared with me.
01Gn 30:30 "For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?"
01Gn 30:31 So he said, "What shall I give you?" And Jacob said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this [one] thing for me, I will again pasture [and] keep your flock£º
01Gn 30:32 let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black one among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and [such] shall be my wages.
01Gn 30:33 "So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, [if found] with me, will be considered stolen."
01Gn 30:34 And Laban said, "Good, let it be according to your word."
01Gn 30:35 So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons.
01Gn 30:36 And he put [a distance of] three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
01Gn 30:37 Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which [was] in the rods.
01Gn 30:38 And he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, [even] in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink.
01Gn 30:39 So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
01Gn 30:40 And Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.
01Gn 30:41 Moreover, it came about whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, that Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the gutters, so that they might mate by the rods;
01Gn 30:42 but when the flock was feeble, he did not put [them] in; so the feebler were Laban's and the stronger Jacob's.
01Gn 30:43 So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks and female and male servants and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 31:1 Now Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth."
01Gn 31:2 And Jacob saw the attitude of Laban, and behold, it was not [friendly] toward him as formerly.
01Gn 31:3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
01Gn 31:4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,
01Gn 31:5 and said to them, "I see your father's attitude, that it is not [friendly] toward me as formerly, but the God of my father has been with me.
01Gn 31:6 "And you know that I have served your father with all my strength.
01Gn 31:7 "Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times; however, God did not allow him to hurt me.
01Gn 31:8 "If he spoke thus, 'The speckled shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth speckled; and if he spoke thus, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock brought forth striped.
01Gn 31:9 "Thus God has taken away your father's livestock and given [them] to me.
01Gn 31:10 "And it came about at the time when the flock were mating that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which were mating [were] striped, speckled, and mottled.
01Gn 31:11 "Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'
01Gn 31:12 "And he said, 'Lift up, now, your eyes and see [that] all the male goats which are mating are striped, speckled, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
01Gn 31:13 'I am the God [of] Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you made a vow to Me; now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.' "
01Gn 31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?
01Gn 31:15 "Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also entirely consumed our purchase price.
01Gn 31:16 "Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and our children; now then, do whatever God has said to you."
01Gn 31:17 Then Jacob arose and put his children and his wives upon camels;
01Gn 31:18 and he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had gathered, his acquired livestock which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
01Gn 31:19 When Laban had gone to shear his flock, then Rachel stole the household idols that were her father's.
01Gn 31:20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he was fleeing.
01Gn 31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he arose and crossed the [Euphrates] River, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:22 When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
01Gn 31:23 then he took his kinsmen with him, and pursued him [a distance of] seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:24 And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."
01Gn 31:25 And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen camped in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:26 Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done by deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?
01Gn 31:27 "Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with timbrel and with lyre;
01Gn 31:28 and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now you have done foolishly.
01Gn 31:29 "It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to speak either good or bad to Jacob.'
01Gn 31:30 "And now you have indeed gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house; [but] why did you steal my gods?"
01Gn 31:31 Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you would take your daughters from me by force.'
01Gn 31:32 "The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our kinsmen point out what is yours among my belongings and take [it] for yourself." For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
01Gn 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find [them.] Then he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.
01Gn 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat on them. And Laban felt through all the tent, but did not find [them.]
01Gn 31:35 And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the household idols.
01Gn 31:36 Then Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, "What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
01Gn 31:37 "Though you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set [it] here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
01Gn 31:38 "These twenty years I [have been] with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.
01Gn 31:39 "That which was torn [of beasts] I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it of my hand [whether] stolen by day or stolen by night.
01Gn 31:40 "[Thus] I was£º by day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
01Gn 31:41 "These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you changed my wages ten times.
01Gn 31:42 "If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had not been for me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, so He rendered judgment last night."
01Gn 31:43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
01Gn 31:44 "So now come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:45 Then Jacob took a stone and set it up [as] a pillar.
01Gn 31:46 And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
01Gn 31:47 Now Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
01Gn 31:48 And Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me this day." Therefore it was named Galeed;
01Gn 31:49 and Mizpah, for he said, "May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent one from the other.
01Gn 31:50 "If you mistreat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, [although] no man is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap and behold the pillar which I have set between you and me.
01Gn 31:52 "This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to you for harm, and you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
01Gn 31:53 "The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
01Gn 31:54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his kinsmen to the meal; and they ate the meal and spent the night on the mountain.
01Gn 31:55 And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his place.
01Gn 32:1 Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him.
01Gn 32:2 And Jacob said when he saw them, "This is God's camp." So he named that place Mahanaim.
01Gn 32:3 Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
01Gn 32:4 He also commanded them saying, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau£º ' Thus says your servant Jacob," I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;
01Gn 32:5 and I have oxen and donkeys [and] flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight. "'"
01Gn 32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
01Gn 32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies;
01Gn 32:8 for he said, "If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape."
01Gn 32:9 And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who didst say to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,'
01Gn 32:10 I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which Thou hast shown to Thy servant; for with my staff [only] I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies.
01Gn 32:11 "Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
01Gn 32:12 "For Thou didst say, 'I will surely prosper you, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"
01Gn 32:13 So he spent the night there. Then he selected from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau£º
01Gn 32:14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
01Gn 32:15 thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
01Gn 32:16 And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between droves."
01Gn 32:17 And he commanded the one in front, saying, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and to whom do these [animals] in front of you belong?'
01Gn 32:18 then you shall say, '[These] belong to your servant Jacob; it is a present sent to my lord Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.' "
01Gn 32:19 Then he commanded also the second and the third, and all those who followed the droves, saying, "After this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him;
01Gn 32:20 and you shall say, 'Behold, your servant Jacob also is behind us.' " For he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me. Then afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
01Gn 32:21 So the present passed on before him, while he himself spent that night in the camp.
01Gn 32:22 Now he arose that same night and took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
01Gn 32:23 And he took them and sent them across the stream. And he sent across whatever he had.
01Gn 32:24 Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
01Gn 32:25 And when he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he touched the socket of his thigh; so the socket of Jacob's thigh was dislocated while he wrestled with him.
01Gn 32:26 Then he said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But he said, " I will not let you go unless you bless me. "
01Gn 32:27 So he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
01Gn 32:28 And he said, "Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have striven with God and with men and have prevailed."
01Gn 32:29 Then Jacob asked him and said, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And he blessed him there.
01Gn 32:30 So Jacob named the place Peniel, for [he said,] "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been preserved."
01Gn 32:31 Now the sun rose upon him just as he crossed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh.
01Gn 32:32 Therefore, to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
01Gn 33:1 Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.
01Gn 33:2 And he put the maids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
01Gn 33:3 But he himself passed on ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
01Gn 33:4 Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
01Gn 33:5 And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said, "Who are these with you?" So he said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
01Gn 33:6 Then the maids came near with their children, and they bowed down.
01Gn 33:7 And Leah likewise came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down.
01Gn 33:8 And he said, "What do you mean by all this company which I have met?" And he said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."
01Gn 33:9 But Esau said, "I have plenty, my brother; let what you have be your own."
01Gn 33:10 And Jacob said, "No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand, for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably.
01Gn 33:11 "Please take my gift which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have plenty." Thus he urged him and he took [it.]
01Gn 33:12 Then Esau said, "Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you."
01Gn 33:13 But he said to him, "My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds which are nursing are a care to me. And if they are driven hard one day, all the flocks will die.
01Gn 33:14 "Please let my lord pass on before his servant; and I will proceed at my leisure, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord at Seir."
01Gn 33:15 And Esau said, "Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
01Gn 33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
01Gn 33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth; and built for himself a house, and made booths for his livestock, therefore the place is named Succoth.
01Gn 33:18 Now Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city.
01Gn 33:19 And he bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.
01Gn 33:20 Then he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.
01Gn 34:1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.
01Gn 34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force.
01Gn 34:3 And he was deeply attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
01Gn 34:4 So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, "Get me this young girl for a wife."
01Gn 34:5 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob kept silent until they came in.
01Gn 34:6 Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
01Gn 34:7 Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard [it;] and the men were grieved, and they were very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.
01Gn 34:8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, "The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him in marriage.
01Gn 34:9 "And intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
01Gn 34:10 "Thus you shall live with us, and the land shall be [open] before you; live and trade in it, and acquire property in it."
01Gn 34:11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, "If I find favor in your sight, then I will give whatever you say to me.
01Gn 34:12 "Ask me ever so much bridal payment and gift, and I will give according as you say to me; but give me the girl in marriage."
01Gn 34:13 But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor, with deceit, and spoke to them, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.
01Gn 34:14 And they said to them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.
01Gn 34:15 "Only on this [condition] will we consent to you£º if you will become like us, in that every male of you be circumcised,
01Gn 34:16 then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people.
01Gn 34:17 "But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go."
01Gn 34:18 Now their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.
01Gn 34:19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Now he was more respected than all the household of his father.
01Gn 34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
01Gn 34:21 "These men are friendly with us; therefore let them live in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage, and give our daughters to them.
01Gn 34:22 "Only on this [condition] will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people£º that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
01Gn 34:23 "Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will live with us."
01Gn 34:24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
01Gn 34:25 Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male.
01Gn 34:26 And they killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem's house, and went forth.
01Gn 34:27 Jacob's sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because they had defiled their sister.
01Gn 34:28 They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field;
01Gn 34:29 and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, even all that [was] in the houses.
01Gn 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me, by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I shall be destroyed, I and my household."
01Gn 34:31 But they said, "Should he treat our sister as a harlot?"
01Gn 35:1 Then God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there; and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."
01Gn 35:2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;
01Gn 35:3 and let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and has been with me wherever I have gone. "
01Gn 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
01Gn 35:5 As they journeyed, there was a great terror upon the cities which were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
01Gn 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.
01Gn 35:7 And he built an altar there, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him, when he fled from his brother.
01Gn 35:8 Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; it was named Allon-bacuth.
01Gn 35:9 Then God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.
01Gn 35:10 And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; You shall no longer be called Jacob, But Israel shall be your name." Thus He called him Israel.
01Gn 35:11 God also said to him, "I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings shall come forth from you.
01Gn 35:12 "And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after you."
01Gn 35:13 Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
01Gn 35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a libation on it; he also poured oil on it.
01Gn 35:15 So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
01Gn 35:16 Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and she suffered severe labor.
01Gn 35:17 And it came about when she was in severe labor that the midwife said to her, "Do not fear, for now you have [another] son."
01Gn 35:18 And it came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
01Gn 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 35:20 And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
01Gn 35:21 Then Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
01Gn 35:22 And it came about while Israel was dwelling in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard [of it.] Now there were twelve sons of Jacob--
01Gn 35:23 the sons of Leah£º Reuben, Jacob's first-born, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;
01Gn 35:24 the sons of Rachel£º Joseph and Benjamin;
01Gn 35:25 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid£º Dan and Naphtali;
01Gn 35:26 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid£º Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
01Gn 35:27 And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
01Gn 35:28 Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
01Gn 35:29 And Isaac breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, an old man of ripe age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
01Gn 36:1 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
01Gn 36:2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan£º Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
01Gn 36:3 also Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 36:4 And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel,
01Gn 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 36:6 Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his goods which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to [another] land away from his brother Jacob.
01Gn 36:7 For their property had become too great for them to live together, and the land where they sojourned could not sustain them because of their livestock.
01Gn 36:8 So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.
01Gn 36:9 These then are [the records of] the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
01Gn 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons£º Eliphaz the son of Esau's wife Adah, Reuel the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho and Gatam and Kenaz.
01Gn 36:12 And Timna was a concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Esau's wife Adah.
01Gn 36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel£º Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:14 And these were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon£º she bore to Esau, Jeush and Jalam and Korah.
01Gn 36:15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the first-born of Esau, are chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
01Gn 36:16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
01Gn 36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son£º chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:18 And these are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah£º chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:19 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
01Gn 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land£º Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,
01Gn 36:21 and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
01Gn 36:22 And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
01Gn 36:23 And these are the sons of Shobal£º Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
01Gn 36:24 And these are the sons of Zibeon£º Aiah and Anah-- he is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
01Gn 36:25 And these are the children of Anah£º Dishon, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:26 And these are the sons of Dishon£º Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
01Gn 36:27 These are the sons of Ezer£º Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
01Gn 36:28 These are the sons of Dishan£º Uz and Aran.
01Gn 36:29 These are the chiefs descended from the Horites£º chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
01Gn 36:30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan. These are the chiefs descended from the Horites, according to their [various] chiefs in the land of Seir.
01Gn 36:31 Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.
01Gn 36:32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
01Gn 36:33 Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah became king in his place.
01Gn 36:34 Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites became king in his place.
01Gn 36:35 Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab, became king in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.
01Gn 36:36 Then Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah became king in his place.
01Gn 36:37 Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the [Euphrates] River became king in his place.
01Gn 36:38 Then Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor became king in his place.
01Gn 36:39 Then Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar became king in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.
01Gn 36:40 Now these are the names of the chiefs descended from Esau, according to their families [and] their localities, by their names£º chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
01Gn 36:41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
01Gn 36:42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
01Gn 36:43 chief Magdiel, chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom (that is, Esau, the father of the Edomites), according to their habitations in the land of their possession.
01Gn 37:1 Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned, in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 37:2 These are [the records of] the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when seventeen years of age, was pasturing the flock with his brothers while he was [still] a youth, along with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
01Gn 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic.
01Gn 37:4 And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and [so] they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.
01Gn 37:5 Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
01Gn 37:6 And he said to them, "Please listen to this dream which I have had;
01Gn 37:7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf rose up and also stood erect; and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf. "
01Gn 37:8 Then his brothers said to him, "Are you actually going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
01Gn 37:9 Now he had still another dream, and related it to his brothers, and said, "Lo, I have had still another dream; and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
01Gn 37:10 And he related [it] to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow ourselves down before you to the ground?"
01Gn 37:11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying [in mind.]
01Gn 37:12 Then his brothers went to pasture their father's flock in Shechem.
01Gn 37:13 And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing [the flock] in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." And he said to him, " I will go. "
01Gn 37:14 Then he said to him, "Go now and see about the welfare of your brothers and the welfare of the flock; and bring word back to me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
01Gn 37:15 And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
01Gn 37:16 And he said, "I am looking for my brothers; please tell me where they are pasturing [the flock.]"
01Gn 37:17 Then the man said, "They have moved from here; for I heard [them] say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
01Gn 37:18 When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to them, they plotted against him to put him to death.
01Gn 37:19 And they said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer!
01Gn 37:20 "Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, 'A wild beast devoured him.' Then let us see what will become of his dreams!"
01Gn 37:21 But Reuben heard [this] and rescued him out of their hands and said, "Let us not take his life."
01Gn 37:22 Reuben further said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him"-- that he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father.
01Gn 37:23 So it came about, when Joseph reached his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the varicolored tunic that was on him;
01Gn 37:24 and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, without any water in it.
01Gn 37:25 Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring [ them] down to Egypt.
01Gn 37:26 And Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover up his blood?
01Gn 37:27 "Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; for he is our brother, our [own] flesh." And his brothers listened [to him.]
01Gn 37:28 Then some Midianite traders passed by, so they pulled [him] up and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty [shekels] of silver. Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt.
01Gn 37:29 Now Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his garments.
01Gn 37:30 And he returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not [there;] as for me, where am I to go?"
01Gn 37:31 So they took Joseph's tunic, and slaughtered a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood;
01Gn 37:32 and they sent the varicolored tunic and brought it to their father and said, "We found this; please examine [it] to [see] whether it is your son's tunic or not."
01Gn 37:33 Then he examined it and said, "It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!"
01Gn 37:34 So Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
01Gn 37:35 Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. And he said, "Surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son." So his father wept for him.
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's officer, the captain of the bodyguard.
01Gn 38:1 And it came about at that time, that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
01Gn 38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her and went in to her.
01Gn 38:3 So she conceived and bore a son and he named him Er.
01Gn 38:4 Then she conceived again and bore a son and named him Onan.
01Gn 38:5 And she bore still another son and named him Shelah; and it was at Chezib that she bore him.
01Gn 38:6 Now Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name [was] Tamar.
01Gn 38:7 But Er, Judah's first-born, was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD took his life.
01Gn 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."
01Gn 38:9 And Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so it came about that when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground, in order not to give offspring to his brother.
01Gn 38:10 But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also.
01Gn 38:11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"; for he thought, "[I am afraid] that he too may die like his brothers." So Tamar went and lived in her father's house.
01Gn 38:12 Now after a considerable time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, Judah went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
01Gn 38:13 And it was told to Tamar, "Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
01Gn 38:14 So she removed her widow's garments and covered [herself] with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife.
01Gn 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she [was] a harlot, for she had covered her face.
01Gn 38:16 So he turned aside to her by the road, and said, "Here now, let me come in to you"; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
01Gn 38:17 He said, therefore, "I will send you a kid from the flock." She said, moreover, "Will you give a pledge until you send [it?]"
01Gn 38:18 And he said, "What pledge shall I give you?" And she said, "Your seal and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave [them] to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
01Gn 38:19 Then she arose and departed, and removed her veil and put on her widow's garments.
01Gn 38:20 When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
01Gn 38:21 And he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?" But they said, "There has been no temple prostitute here."
01Gn 38:22 So he returned to Judah, and said, "I did not find her; and furthermore, the men of the place said, 'There has been no temple prostitute here.'"
01Gn 38:23 Then Judah said, "Let her keep them, lest we become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this kid, but you did not find her."
01Gn 38:24 Now it was about three months later that Judah was informed, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot, and behold, she is also with child by harlotry." Then Judah said, "Bring her out and let her be burned!"
01Gn 38:25 It was while she was being brought out that she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "I am with child by the man to whom these things belong." And she said, "Please examine and see, whose signet ring and cords and staff are these?"
01Gn 38:26 And Judah recognized [them,] and said, "She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not have relations with her again.
01Gn 38:27 And it came about at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb.
01Gn 38:28 Moreover, it took place while she was giving birth, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet [thread] on his hand, saying, " This one came out first. "
01Gn 38:29 But it came about as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out. Then she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" So he was named Perez.
01Gn 38:30 And afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet [thread] on his hand; and he was named Zerah.
01Gn 39:1 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there.
01Gn 39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
01Gn 39:3 Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and [how] the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
01Gn 39:4 So Joseph found favor in his sight, and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge.
01Gn 39:5 And it came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; thus the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field.
01Gn 39:6 So he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge; and with him [there] he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
01Gn 39:7 And it came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me."
01Gn 39:8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me [here,] my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge.
01Gn 39:9 "There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil, and sin against God?"
01Gn 39:10 And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not listen to her to lie beside her, [or] be with her.
01Gn 39:11 Now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the household was there inside.
01Gn 39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!" And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside.
01Gn 39:13 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled outside,
01Gn 39:14 she called to the men of her household, and said to them, "See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed.
01Gn 39:15 "And it came about when he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, that he left his garment beside me and fled, and went outside."
01Gn 39:16 So she left his garment beside her until his master came home.
01Gn 39:17 Then she spoke to him with these words, "The Hebrew slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me;
01Gn 39:18 and it happened as I raised my voice and screamed, that he left his garment beside me and fled outside. "
01Gn 39:19 Now it came about when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your slave did to me," that his anger burned.
01Gn 39:20 So Joseph's master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; and he was there in the jail.
01Gn 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
01Gn 39:22 And the chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was responsible [for it.]
01Gn 39:23 The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made to prosper.
01Gn 40:1 Then it came about after these things the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt.
01Gn 40:2 And Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
01Gn 40:3 So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, in the jail, the [same] place where Joseph was imprisoned.
01Gn 40:4 And the captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them; and they were in confinement for some time.
01Gn 40:5 Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his [own] dream [and] each dream with its [own] interpretation.
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected.
01Gn 40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"
01Gn 40:8 Then they said to him, "We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell [it] to me, please."
01Gn 40:9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, " In my dream, behold, [there was] a vine in front of me;
01Gn 40:10 and on the vine [were] three branches. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out, [and] its clusters produced ripe grapes.
01Gn 40:11 "Now Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
01Gn 40:12 Then Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it£º the three branches are three days;
01Gn 40:13 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer.
01Gn 40:14 "Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house.
01Gn 40:15 "For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon."
01Gn 40:16 When the chief baker saw that he had interpreted favorably, he said to Joseph, "I also [saw] in my dream, and behold, [there were] three baskets of white bread on my head;
01Gn 40:17 and in the top basket [there were] some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head. "
01Gn 40:18 Then Joseph answered and said, "This is its interpretation£º the three baskets are three days;
01Gn 40:19 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh off you. "
01Gn 40:20 Thus it came about on the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
01Gn 40:21 And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand;
01Gn 40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
01Gn 40:23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
01Gn 41:1 Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.
01Gn 41:2 And lo, from the Nile there came up seven cows, sleek and fat; and they grazed in the marsh grass.
01Gn 41:3 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood by the [other] cows on the bank of the Nile.
01Gn 41:4 And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
01Gn 41:5 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good.
01Gn 41:6 Then behold, seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
01Gn 41:7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, [it was] a dream.
01Gn 41:8 Now it came about in the morning that his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I would make mention today of my [own] offenses.
01Gn 41:10 "Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, [both] me and the chief baker.
01Gn 41:11 "And we had a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his [own] dream.
01Gn 41:12 "Now a Hebrew youth [was] with us there, a servant of the captain of the bodyguard, and we related [them] to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. To each one he interpreted according to his [own] dream.
01Gn 41:13 "And it came about that just as he interpreted for us, so it happened; he restored me in my office, but he hanged him."
01Gn 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
01Gn 41:16 Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."
01Gn 41:17 So Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile;
01Gn 41:18 and behold, seven cows, fat and sleek came up out of the Nile; and they grazed in the marsh grass.
01Gn 41:19 "And lo, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such as I had never seen for ugliness in all the land of Egypt;
01Gn 41:20 and the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
01Gn 41:21 "Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had devoured them; for they were just as ugly as before. Then I awoke.
01Gn 41:22 "I saw also in my dream, and behold, seven ears, full and good, came up on a single stalk;
01Gn 41:23 and lo, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them;
01Gn 41:24 and the thin ears swallowed the seven good ears. Then I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me. "
01Gn 41:25 Now Joseph said to Pharaoh, "Pharaoh's dreams are one [and the same;] God has told to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
01Gn 41:26 "The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one [and the same.]
01Gn 41:27 "And the seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven thin ears scorched by the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
01Gn 41:28 "It is as I have spoken to Pharaoh£º God has shown to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
01Gn 41:29 "Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt;
01Gn 41:30 and after them seven years of famine will come, and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will ravage the land.
01Gn 41:31 "So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that subsequent famine; for it [will be] very severe.
01Gn 41:32 "Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, [it means] that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about.
01Gn 41:33 "And now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:34 "Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land, and let him exact a fifth [of the produce] of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.
01Gn 41:35 "Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and store up the grain for food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority, and let them guard [it.]
01Gn 41:36 "And let the food become as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish during the famine."
01Gn 41:37 Now the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.
01Gn 41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is a divine spirit?"
01Gn 41:39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are.
01Gn 41:40 "You shall be over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage; only in the throne I will be greater than you."
01Gn 41:41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:42 Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put the gold necklace around his neck.
01Gn 41:43 And he had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed before him, "Bow the knee!" And he set him over all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "[Though] I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:45 Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went forth over the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:47 And during the seven years of plenty the land brought forth abundantly.
01Gn 41:48 So he gathered all the food of [these] seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt, and placed the food in the cities; he placed in every city the food from its own surrounding fields.
01Gn 41:49 Thus Joseph stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped measuring [it,] for it was beyond measure.
01Gn 41:50 Now before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.
01Gn 41:51 And Joseph named the first-born Manasseh, "For," [he said,] "God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
01Gn 41:52 And he named the second Ephraim, "For," [he said,] "God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
01Gn 41:53 When the seven years of plenty which had been in the land of Egypt came to an end,
01Gn 41:54 and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said, then there was famine in all the lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
01Gn 41:55 So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do."
01Gn 41:56 When the famine was [spread] over all the face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:57 And [the people of] all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
01Gn 42:1 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, "Why are you staring at one another?"
01Gn 42:2 And he said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy [some] for us from that place, so that we may live and not die."
01Gn 42:3 Then ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt.
01Gn 42:4 But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, "I am afraid that harm may befall him."
01Gn 42:5 So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Canaan [also.]
01Gn 42:6 Now Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with [their] faces to the ground.
01Gn 42:7 When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. And he said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."
01Gn 42:8 But Joseph had recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him.
01Gn 42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had about them, and said to them, "You are spies; you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land."
01Gn 42:10 Then they said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.
01Gn 42:11 "We are all sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies."
01Gn 42:12 Yet he said to them, "No, but you have come to look at the undefended parts of our land!"
01Gn 42:13 But they said, "Your servants are twelve brothers [in all,] the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more."
01Gn 42:14 And Joseph said to them, "It is as I said to you, you are spies;
01Gn 42:15 by this you will be tested£º by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here!
01Gn 42:16 "Send one of you that he may get your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies."
01Gn 42:17 So he put them all together in prison for three days.
01Gn 42:18 Now Joseph said to them on the third day, "Do this and live, for I fear God£º
01Gn 42:19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your prison; but as for [the rest of] you, go, carry grain for the famine of your households,
01Gn 42:20 and bring your youngest brother to me, so your words may be verified, and you will not die. "And they did so.
01Gn 42:21 Then they said to one another, "Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us."
01Gn 42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'; and you would not listen? Now comes the reckoning for his blood."
01Gn 42:23 They did not know, however, that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.
01Gn 42:24 And he turned away from them and wept. But when he returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
01Gn 42:25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. And thus it was done for them.
01Gn 42:26 So they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
01Gn 42:27 And as one [of them] opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
01Gn 42:28 Then he said to his brothers, "My money has been returned, and behold, it is even in my sack." And their hearts sank, and they [turned] trembling to one another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
01Gn 42:29 When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
01Gn 42:30 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
01Gn 42:31 "But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.
01Gn 42:32 'We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.'
01Gn 42:33 "And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men£º leave one of your brothers with me and take [grain for] the famine of your households, and go.
01Gn 42:34 'But bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies, but honest men. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.' "
01Gn 42:35 Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money [was] in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were dismayed.
01Gn 42:36 And their father Jacob said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children£º Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me."
01Gn 42:37 Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him [back] to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you."
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should befall him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow."
01Gn 43:1 Now the famine was severe in the land.
01Gn 43:2 So it came about when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, "Go back, buy us a little food."
01Gn 43:3 Judah spoke to him, however, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, ' You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you. '
01Gn 43:4 "If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
01Gn 43:5 "But if you do not send [him,] we will not go down; for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
01Gn 43:6 Then Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man whether you still had [another] brother?"
01Gn 43:7 But they said, "The man questioned particularly about us and our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you [another] brother?' So we answered his questions. Could we possibly know that he would say,' Bring your brother down '?"
01Gn 43:8 And Judah said to his father Israel, "Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, we as well as you and our little ones.
01Gn 43:9 "I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him [back] to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever.
01Gn 43:10 "For if we had not delayed, surely by now we could have returned twice."
01Gn 43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, "If [it must be] so, then do this£º take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and carry down to the man as a present, a little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.
01Gn 43:12 "And take double [the] money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.
01Gn 43:13 "Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;
01Gn 43:14 and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. "
01Gn 43:15 So the men took this present, and they took double [the] money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
01Gn 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, "Bring the men into the house, and slay [an animal] and make ready; for the men are to dine with me at noon."
01Gn 43:17 So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph's house.
01Gn 43:18 Now the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, "[It is] because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, and take us for slaves with our donkeys."
01Gn 43:19 So they came near to Joseph's house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,
01Gn 43:20 and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food,
01Gn 43:21 and it came about when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand.
01Gn 43:22 "We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put our money in our sacks."
01Gn 43:23 And he said, "Be at ease, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
01Gn 43:24 Then the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.
01Gn 43:25 So they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which was in their hand and bowed to the ground before him.
01Gn 43:27 Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, "Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"
01Gn 43:28 And they said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And they bowed down in homage.
01Gn 43:29 As he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, he said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?" And he said, "May God be gracious to you, my son."
01Gn 43:30 And Joseph hurried [out] for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he sought [a place] to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.
01Gn 43:31 Then he washed his face, and came out; and he controlled himself and said, "Serve the meal."
01Gn 43:32 So they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians.
01Gn 43:33 Now they were seated before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.
01Gn 43:34 And he took portions to them from his own table; but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
01Gn 44:1 Then he commanded his house steward, saying, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack.
01Gn 44:2 "And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph had told [him].
01Gn 44:3 As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys.
01Gn 44:4 They had [just] gone out of the city, [and] were not far off, when Joseph said to his house steward, "Up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?
01Gn 44:5 'Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.' "
01Gn 44:6 So he overtook them and spoke these words to them.
01Gn 44:7 And they said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.
01Gn 44:8 "Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
01Gn 44:9 "With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves."
01Gn 44:10 So he said, "Now let it also be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and [the rest of] you shall be innocent."
01Gn 44:11 Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
01Gn 44:12 And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
01Gn 44:13 Then they tore their clothes, and when each man loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.
01Gn 44:14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.
01Gn 44:15 And Joseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed practice divination?"
01Gn 44:16 So Judah said, "What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been found."
01Gn 44:17 But he said, "Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose possession the cup has been found, he shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
01Gn 44:18 Then Judah approached him, and said, "Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal to Pharaoh.
01Gn 44:19 "My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father or a brother?'
01Gn 44:20 "And we said to my lord, 'We have an old father and a little child of [his] old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.'
01Gn 44:21 "Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'
01Gn 44:22 "But we said to my lord, 'The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'
01Gn 44:23 "You said to your servants, however, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'
01Gn 44:24 "Thus it came about when we went up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
01Gn 44:25 "And our father said, 'Go back, buy us a little food.'
01Gn 44:26 "But we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
01Gn 44:27 "And your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons;
01Gn 44:28 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces," and I have not seen him since.
01Gn 44:29 'And if you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.'
01Gn 44:30 "Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad's life,
01Gn 44:31 it will come about when he sees that the lad is not [with us], that he will die. Thus your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
01Gn 44:32 "For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, ' If I do not bring him [back] to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever. '
01Gn 44:33 "Now, therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
01Gn 44:34 "For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest I see the evil that would overtake my father?"
01Gn 45:1 Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried, "Have everyone go out from me." So there was no man with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
01Gn 45:2 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard [it], and the household of Pharaoh heard [of it].
01Gn 45:3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
01Gn 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Please come closer to me." And they came closer. And he said, "I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
01Gn 45:5 "And now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
01Gn 45:6 "For the famine [has been] in the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
01Gn 45:7 "And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
01Gn 45:8 "Now, therefore, it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 45:9 "Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph," God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
01Gn 45:10 "And you shall live in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.
01Gn 45:11 "There I will also provide for you, for there are still five years of famine [to come], lest you and your household and all that you have be impoverished." '
01Gn 45:12 "And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin [see], that it is my mouth which is speaking to you.
01Gn 45:13 "Now you must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and all that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here."
01Gn 45:14 Then he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.
01Gn 45:15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.
01Gn 45:16 Now when the news was heard in Pharaoh's house that Joseph's brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
01Gn 45:17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this£º load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan,
01Gn 45:18 and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you shall eat the fat of the land. '
01Gn 45:19 "Now you are ordered, 'Do this£º take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come.
01Gn 45:20 'And do not concern yourselves with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.' "
01Gn 45:21 Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
01Gn 45:22 To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces of] silver and five changes of garments.
01Gn 45:23 And to his father he sent as follows£º ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and sustenance for his father on the journey.
01Gn 45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, "Do not quarrel on the journey."
01Gn 45:25 Then they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
01Gn 45:26 And they told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt." But he was stunned, for he did not believe them.
01Gn 45:27 When they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
01Gn 45:28 Then Israel said, "It is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
01Gn 46:1 So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
01Gn 46:2 And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am."
01Gn 46:3 And He said, "I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there.
01Gn 46:4 "I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and Joseph will close your eyes."
01Gn 46:5 Then Jacob arose from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their little ones and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
01Gn 46:6 And they took their livestock and their property, which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him£º
01Gn 46:7 his sons and his grandsons with him, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.
01Gn 46:8 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt£º Reuben, Jacob's first-born.
01Gn 46:9 And the sons of Reuben£º Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.
01Gn 46:10 And the sons of Simeon£º Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
01Gn 46:11 And the sons of Levi£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
01Gn 46:12 And the sons of Judah£º Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
01Gn 46:13 And the sons of Issachar£º Tola and Puvvah and Iob and Shimron.
01Gn 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun£º Sered and Elon and Jahleel.
01Gn 46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all his sons and his daughters [numbered] thirty-three.
01Gn 46:16 And the sons of Gad£º Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
01Gn 46:17 And the sons of Asher£º Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah£º Heber and Malchiel.
01Gn 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons.
01Gn 46:19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel£º Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 46:20 Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.
01Gn 46:21 And the sons of Benjamin£º Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
01Gn 46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; [there were] fourteen persons in all.
01Gn 46:23 And the sons of Dan£º Hushim.
01Gn 46:24 And the sons of Naphtali£º Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.
01Gn 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel, and she bore these to Jacob; [there were] seven persons in all.
01Gn 46:26 All the persons belonging to Jacob, who came to Egypt, his direct descendants, not including the wives of Jacob's sons, [were] sixty-six persons in all,
01Gn 46:27 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt were two; all the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, [were] seventy.
01Gn 46:28 Now he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to point out [the way] before him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
01Gn 46:29 And Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time.
01Gn 46:30 Then Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
01Gn 46:31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who [were] in the land of Canaan, have come to me;
01Gn 46:32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have. '
01Gn 46:33 "And it shall come about when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'
01Gn 46:34 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' that you may live in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians. "
01Gn 47:1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
01Gn 47:2 And he took five men from among his brothers, and presented them to Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:3 Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?" So they said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers."
01Gn 47:4 And they said to Pharaoh, "We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now, therefore, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen."
01Gn 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.
01Gn 47:6 "The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land, let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know any capable men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
01Gn 47:7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many years have you lived?"
01Gn 47:9 So Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty; few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, nor have they attained the years that my fathers lived during the days of their sojourning."
01Gn 47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from his presence.
01Gn 47:11 So Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered.
01Gn 47:12 And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to their little ones.
01Gn 47:13 Now there was no food in all the land, because the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
01Gn 47:14 And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
01Gn 47:15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For [our] money is gone."
01Gn 47:16 Then Joseph said, "Give up your livestock, and I will give you [food] for your livestock, since [your] money is gone."
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
01Gn 47:18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent, and the cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our lands.
01Gn 47:19 "Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. So give us seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate."
01Gn 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. Thus the land became Pharaoh's.
01Gn 47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of Egypt's border to the other.
01Gn 47:22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore, they did not sell their land.
01Gn 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have today bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, [here] is seed for you, and you may sow the land.
01Gn 47:24 "And at the harvest you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and as food for your little ones."
01Gn 47:25 So they said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves."
01Gn 47:26 And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt [valid] to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh's.
01Gn 47:27 Now Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in Goshen, and they acquired property in it and were fruitful and became very numerous.
01Gn 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob's life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
01Gn 47:29 When the time for Israel to die drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "Please, if I have found favor in your sight, place now your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt,
01Gn 47:30 but when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. "And he said," I will do as you have said. "
01Gn 47:31 And he said, "Swear to me." So he swore to him. Then Israel bowed [ in worship] at the head of the bed.
01Gn 48:1 Now it came about after these things that Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is sick." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him.
01Gn 48:2 When it was told to Jacob, "Behold, your son Joseph has come to you," Israel collected his strength and sat up in the bed.
01Gn 48:3 Then Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
01Gn 48:4 and He said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.'
01Gn 48:5 "And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
01Gn 48:6 "But your offspring that have been born after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the names of their brothers in their inheritance.
01Gn 48:7 "Now as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."
01Gn 48:8 When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"
01Gn 48:9 And Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." So he said, "Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them."
01Gn 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were [so] dim from age [that] he could not see. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
01Gn 48:11 And Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well."
01Gn 48:12 Then Joseph took them from his knees, and bowed with his face to the ground.
01Gn 48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them close to him.
01Gn 48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the first-born.
01Gn 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
01Gn 48:16 The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads; And may my name live on in them, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. "
01Gn 48:17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head, it displeased him; and he grasped his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
01Gn 48:18 And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father, for this one is the first-born. Place your right hand on his head."
01Gn 48:19 But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people and he also shall be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."
01Gn 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel shall pronounce blessing, saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!'" Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
01Gn 48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
01Gn 48:22 "And I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow."
01Gn 49:1 Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what shall befall you in the days to come.
01Gn 49:2 "Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob; And listen to Israel your father.
01Gn 49:3 "Reuben, you are my first-born; My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.
01Gn 49:4 "Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled [it]-- he went up to my couch.
01Gn 49:5 "Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are implements of violence.
01Gn 49:6 "Let my soul not enter into their council; Let not my glory be united with their assembly; Because in their anger they slew men, And in their self-will they lamed oxen.
01Gn 49:7 "Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.
01Gn 49:8 "Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons shall bow down to you.
01Gn 49:9 "Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him up?
01Gn 49:10 "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him [shall be] the obedience of the peoples.
01Gn 49:11 "He ties [his] foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes.
01Gn 49:12 "His eyes are dull from wine, And his teeth white from milk.
01Gn 49:13 "Zebulun shall dwell at the seashore; And he [shall be] a haven for ships, And his flank [shall be] toward Sidon.
01Gn 49:14 "Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds.
01Gn 49:15 "When he saw that a resting place was good And that the land was pleasant, He bowed his shoulder to bear [burdens], And became a slave at forced labor.
01Gn 49:16 "Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
01Gn 49:17 "Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.
01Gn 49:18 "For Thy salvation I wait, O LORD.
01Gn 49:19 "As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he shall raid [at] their heels.
01Gn 49:20 "As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he shall yield royal dainties.
01Gn 49:21 "Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words.
01Gn 49:22 "Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; [Its] branches run over a wall.
01Gn 49:23 "The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot [at him] and harassed him;
01Gn 49:24 But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),
01Gn 49:25 From the God of your father who helps you, And by the Almighty who blesses you [With] blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
01Gn 49:26 "The blessings of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
01Gn 49:27 "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoil."
01Gn 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him.
01Gn 49:29 Then he charged them and said to them, "I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
01Gn 49:30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site.
01Gn 49:31 "There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah--
01Gn 49:32 the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth. "
01Gn 49:33 When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
01Gn 50:1 Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him and kissed him.
01Gn 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
01Gn 50:3 Now forty days were required for it, for such is the period required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
01Gn 50:4 And when the days of mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying,
01Gn 50:5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am about to die; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.' "
01Gn 50:6 And Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear."
01Gn 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
01Gn 50:8 and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father's household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.
01Gn 50:9 There also went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company.
01Gn 50:10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he observed seven days mourning for his father.
01Gn 50:11 Now when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
01Gn 50:12 And thus his sons did for him as he had charged them;
01Gn 50:13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
01Gn 50:14 And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
01Gn 50:15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph should bear a grudge against us and pay us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him!"
01Gn 50:16 So they sent [a message] to Joseph, saying, "Your father charged before he died, saying,
01Gn 50:17 'Thus you shall say to Joseph, "Please forgive, I beg you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. "And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
01Gn 50:18 Then his brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants."
01Gn 50:19 But Joseph said to them, "Do not be afraid, for am I in God's place?
01Gn 50:20 "And as for you, you meant evil against me, [but] God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive.
01Gn 50:21 "So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones." So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
01Gn 50:22 Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father's household, and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
01Gn 50:23 And Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees.
01Gn 50:24 And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you, and bring you up from this land to the land which He promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob."
01Gn 50:25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry my bones up from here."
01Gn 50:26 So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.
02
02Ex 1:1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household£º
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
02Ex 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
02Ex 1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
02Ex 1:5 And all the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was [already] in Egypt.
02Ex 1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
02Ex 1:7 But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them.
02Ex 1:8 Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
02Ex 1:9 And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.
02Ex 1:10 "Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and in the event of war, they also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us, and depart from the land."
02Ex 1:11 So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses.
02Ex 1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel.
02Ex 1:13 And the Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously;
02Ex 1:14 and they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all [kinds] of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them.
02Ex 1:15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other was named Puah;
02Ex 1:16 and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see [them] upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
02Ex 1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live.
02Ex 1:18 So the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?"
02Ex 1:19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and they give birth before the midwife can get to them."
02Ex 1:20 So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
02Ex 1:21 And it came about because the midwives feared God, that He established households for them.
02Ex 1:22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born you are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive."
02Ex 2:1 Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.
02Ex 2:2 And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.
02Ex 2:3 But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket and covered it over with tar and pitch. Then she put the child into it, and set [it] among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.
02Ex 2:4 And his sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.
02Ex 2:5 Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it [to her.]
02Ex 2:6 When she opened [it,] she saw the child, and behold, [the] boy was crying. And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
02Ex 2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"
02Ex 2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go [ahead]." So the girl went and called the child's mother.
02Ex 2:9 Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I shall give [you] your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
02Ex 2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
02Ex 2:11 Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
02Ex 2:12 So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one [around,] he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
02Ex 2:13 And he went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, "Why are you striking your companion?"
02Ex 2:14 But he said, "Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
02Ex 2:15 When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.
02Ex 2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
02Ex 2:17 Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
02Ex 2:18 When they came to Reuel their father, he said, "Why have you come [ back] so soon today?"
02Ex 2:19 So they said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds; and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock."
02Ex 2:20 And he said to his daughters, "Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat."
02Ex 2:21 And Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.
02Ex 2:22 Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
02Ex 2:23 Now it came about in [the course of] those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of [their] bondage rose up to God.
02Ex 2:24 So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
02Ex 2:25 And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice [of them.]
02Ex 3:1 Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
02Ex 3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed.
02Ex 3:3 So Moses said, "I must turn aside now, and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up."
02Ex 3:4 When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am."
02Ex 3:5 Then He said, "Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
02Ex 3:6 He said also, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
02Ex 3:7 And the LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
02Ex 3:8 "So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
02Ex 3:9 "And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
02Ex 3:10 "Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."
02Ex 3:11 But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?"
02Ex 3:12 And He said, "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you£º when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain."
02Ex 3:13 Then Moses said to God, "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I shall say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.' Now they may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?"
02Ex 3:14 And God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM"; and He said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
02Ex 3:15 And God, furthermore, said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations.
02Ex 3:16 "Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying," I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt.
02Ex 3:17 "So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey." '
02Ex 3:18 "And they will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'
02Ex 3:19 "But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion.
02Ex 3:20 "So I will stretch out My hand, and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go.
02Ex 3:21 "And I will grant this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
02Ex 3:22 "But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the Egyptians."
02Ex 4:1 Then Moses answered and said, "What if they will not believe me, or listen to what I say? For they may say, 'The LORD has not appeared to you.' "
02Ex 4:2 And the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A staff."
02Ex 4:3 Then He said, "Throw it on the ground." So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.
02Ex 4:4 But the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand and grasp [it] by its tail"-- so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand--
02Ex 4:5 "that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
02Ex 4:6 And the LORD furthermore said to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom." So he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.
02Ex 4:7 Then He said, "Put your hand into your bosom again." So he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was restored like [the rest of] his flesh.
02Ex 4:8 "And it shall come about that if they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign.
02Ex 4:9 "But it shall be that if they will not believe even these two signs or heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."
02Ex 4:10 Then Moses said to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since Thou hast spoken to Thy servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
02Ex 4:11 And the LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes [him] dumb or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
02Ex 4:12 "Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say."
02Ex 4:13 But he said, "Please, Lord, now send [the message] by whomever Thou wilt."
02Ex 4:14 Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, "Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
02Ex 4:15 "And you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I, even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do.
02Ex 4:16 "Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and it shall come about that he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as God to him.
02Ex 4:17 "And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs."
02Ex 4:18 Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
02Ex 4:19 Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.
02Ex 4:21 And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
02Ex 4:22 "Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD," Israel is My son, My first-born.
02Ex 4:23 "So I said to you, 'Let My son go, that he may serve Me'; but you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your first-born." '"
02Ex 4:24 Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.
02Ex 4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and threw [it] at Moses' feet, and she said, "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me."
02Ex 4:26 So He let him alone. At that time she said, "[You are] a bridegroom of blood"-- because of the circumcision.
02Ex 4:27 Now the LORD said to Aaron, "Go to meet Moses in the wilderness." So he went and met him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him.
02Ex 4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him [to do.]
02Ex 4:29 Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel;
02Ex 4:30 and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. He then performed the signs in the sight of the people.
02Ex 4:31 So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped.
02Ex 5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.'"
02Ex 5:2 But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go."
02Ex 5:3 Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
02Ex 5:4 But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get [back] to your labors!"
02Ex 5:5 Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!"
02Ex 5:6 So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,
02Ex 5:7 "You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
02Ex 5:8 "But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
02Ex 5:9 "Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it that they may pay no attention to false words."
02Ex 5:10 So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you [any] straw.
02Ex 5:11 'You go [and] get straw for yourselves wherever you can find [it;] but none of your labor will be reduced.' "
02Ex 5:12 So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
02Ex 5:13 And the taskmasters pressed them, saying, "Complete your work quota, [your] daily amount, just as when you had straw."
02Ex 5:14 Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?"
02Ex 5:15 Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?
02Ex 5:16 "There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your [own] people."
02Ex 5:17 But he said, "You are lazy, [very] lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go [and] sacrifice to the LORD.'
02Ex 5:18 "So go now [and] work; for you shall be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks."
02Ex 5:19 And the foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, "You must not reduce [your] daily amount of bricks."
02Ex 5:20 When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.
02Ex 5:21 And they said to them, "May the LORD look upon you and judge [you,] for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
02Ex 5:22 Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why hast Thou brought harm to this people? Why didst Thou ever send me?
02Ex 5:23 "Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he has done harm to this people; and Thou hast not delivered Thy people at all."
02Ex 6:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he shall let them go, and under compulsion he shall drive them out of his land."
02Ex 6:2 God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD;
02Ex 6:3 and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but [by] My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them.
02Ex 6:4 "And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned.
02Ex 6:5 "And furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant.
02Ex 6:6 "Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
02Ex 6:7 'Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
02Ex 6:8 'And I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you [for] a possession; I am the LORD.' "
02Ex 6:9 So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of [their] despondency and cruel bondage.
02Ex 6:10 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 6:11 "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land."
02Ex 6:12 But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?"
02Ex 6:13 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
02Ex 6:14 These are the heads of their fathers' households. The sons of Reuben, Israel's first-born£º Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
02Ex 6:15 And the sons of Simeon£º Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
02Ex 6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations£º Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the length of Levi's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
02Ex 6:17 The sons of Gershon£º Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
02Ex 6:18 And the sons of Kohath£º Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the length of Kohath's life was one hundred and thirty-three years.
02Ex 6:19 And the sons of Merari£º Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
02Ex 6:20 And Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.
02Ex 6:21 And the sons of Izhar£º Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.
02Ex 6:22 And the sons of Uzziel£º Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.
02Ex 6:23 And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02Ex 6:24 And the sons of Korah£º Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
02Ex 6:25 And Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' [households] of the Levites according to their families.
02Ex 6:26 It was [the same] Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts."
02Ex 6:27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was [the same] Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 6:28 Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
02Ex 6:29 that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."
02Ex 6:30 But Moses said before the LORD, "Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?"
02Ex 7:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I make you [as] God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
02Ex 7:2 "You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
02Ex 7:3 "But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:4 "When Pharaoh will not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt, and bring out My hosts, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments.
02Ex 7:5 "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst."
02Ex 7:6 So Moses and Aaron did [it;] as the LORD commanded them, thus they did.
02Ex 7:7 And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02Ex 7:8 Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
02Ex 7:9 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw [it] down before Pharaoh, [that] it may become a serpent.'"
02Ex 7:10 So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
02Ex 7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for [the] wise men and [the] sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.
02Ex 7:12 For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
02Ex 7:13 Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.
02Ex 7:15 "Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.
02Ex 7:16 "And you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying," Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now. "
02Ex 7:17 'Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD£º behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood.
02Ex 7:18 "And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul; and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile." '"
02Ex 7:19 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in [vessels of] wood and in [vessels of] stone.'"
02Ex 7:20 So Moses and Aaron did even as the LORD had commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that [was] in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that [was] in the Nile was turned to blood.
02Ex 7:21 And the fish that [were] in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. And the blood was through all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:22 But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:23 Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.
02Ex 7:24 So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile.
02Ex 7:25 And seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
02Ex 8:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD," Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
02Ex 8:2 "But if you refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite your whole territory with frogs.
02Ex 8:3 "And the Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.
02Ex 8:4 "So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants." '"
02Ex 8:5 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 8:6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:7 And the magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Entreat the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD."
02Ex 8:9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, "The honor is yours to tell me£º when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, [that] they may be left only in the Nile?"
02Ex 8:10 Then he said, "Tomorrow." So he said, "[May it be] according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
02Ex 8:11 "And the frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:12 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.
02Ex 8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts, and the fields.
02Ex 8:14 So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul.
02Ex 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:16 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats through all the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 8:17 And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:18 And the magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast.
02Ex 8:19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:20 Now the LORD said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD," Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
02Ex 8:21 "For if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of insects on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of insects, and also the ground on which they [dwell.]
02Ex 8:22 "But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of insects will be there, in order that you may know that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the land.
02Ex 8:23 "And I will put a division between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall occur." '"
02Ex 8:24 Then the LORD did so. And there came great swarms of insects into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of insects in all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."
02Ex 8:26 But Moses said, "It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not then stone us?
02Ex 8:27 "We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us."
02Ex 8:28 And Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me."
02Ex 8:29 Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the LORD that the swarms of insects may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
02Ex 8:30 So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
02Ex 8:31 And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained.
02Ex 8:32 But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
02Ex 9:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews," Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
02Ex 9:2 "For if you refuse to let [them] go, and continue to hold them,
02Ex 9:3 behold, the hand of the LORD will come [with] a very severe pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks.
02Ex 9:4 "But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel." '"
02Ex 9:5 And the LORD set a definite time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."
02Ex 9:6 So the LORD did this thing on the morrow, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died.
02Ex 9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
02Ex 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
02Ex 9:9 "And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt."
02Ex 9:10 So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast.
02Ex 9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.
02Ex 9:12 And the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses.
02Ex 9:13 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews," Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
02Ex 9:14 "For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
02Ex 9:15 "For [if by] now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth.
02Ex 9:16 "But, indeed, for this cause I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power, and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth.
02Ex 9:17 "Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go.
02Ex 9:18 "Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been [seen] in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
02Ex 9:19 "Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die." '"
02Ex 9:20 The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;
02Ex 9:21 but he who paid no regard to the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.
02Ex 9:22 Now the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
02Ex 9:23 And Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 9:24 So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
02Ex 9:25 And the hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
02Ex 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel [were,] there was no hail.
02Ex 9:27 Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; the LORD is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones.
02Ex 9:28 "Make supplication to the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
02Ex 9:29 And Moses said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease, and there will be hail no longer, that you may know that the earth is the Lord's.
02Ex 9:30 "But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God."
02Ex 9:31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
02Ex 9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they [ripen] late.)
02Ex 9:33 So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth.
02Ex 9:34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
02Ex 9:35 And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
02Ex 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them,
02Ex 10:2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians, and how I performed My signs among them; that you may know that I am the LORD. "
02Ex 10:3 And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
02Ex 10:4 'For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
02Ex 10:5 'And they shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one shall be able to see the land. They shall also eat the rest of what has escaped-- what is left to you from the hail-- and they shall eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field.
02Ex 10:6 'Then your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, [something] which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.' "And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
02Ex 10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?"
02Ex 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go, serve the LORD your God! Who are the ones that are going?"
02Ex 10:9 And Moses said, "We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."
02Ex 10:10 Then he said to them, "Thus may the LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go! Take heed, for evil is in your mind.
02Ex 10:11 "Not so! Go now, the men [among you,] and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire." So they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
02Ex 10:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every plant of the land, [even] all that the hail has left."
02Ex 10:13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
02Ex 10:14 And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; [they were] very numerous. There had never been so [many] locusts, nor would there be so [many] again.
02Ex 10:15 For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 10:16 Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
02Ex 10:17 "Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me."
02Ex 10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.
02Ex 10:19 So the LORD shifted [the wind] to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.
02Ex 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.
02Ex 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt."
02Ex 10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
02Ex 10:23 They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.
02Ex 10:24 Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Even your little ones may go with you."
02Ex 10:25 But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice [them] to the LORD our God.
02Ex 10:26 "Therefore, our livestock, too, will go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD."
02Ex 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
02Ex 10:28 Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
02Ex 10:29 And Moses said, "You are right; I shall never see your face again!"
02Ex 11:1 Now the LORD said to Moses, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely.
02Ex 11:2 "Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold."
02Ex 11:3 And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses [himself] was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, [both] in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
02Ex 11:4 And Moses said, "Thus says the LORD, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,
02Ex 11:5 and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the first-born of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; all the first-born of the cattle as well.
02Ex 11:6 'Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been [before] and such as shall never be again.
02Ex 11:7 'But against any of the sons of Israel a dog shall not [even] bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'
02Ex 11:8 "And all these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, 'Go out, you and all the people who follow you,' and after that I will go out." And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
02Ex 11:9 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
02Ex 11:10 And Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
02Ex 12:1 Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
02Ex 12:2 "This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you.
02Ex 12:3 "Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household.
02Ex 12:4 'Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons [in them;] according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
02Ex 12:5 'Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
02Ex 12:6 'And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight.
02Ex 12:7 'Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
02Ex 12:8 'And they shall eat the flesh that [same] night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
02Ex 12:9 'Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, [both] its head and its legs along with its entrails.
02Ex 12:10 'And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.
02Ex 12:11 'Now you shall eat it in this manner£º [with] your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste-- it is the Lord's Passover.
02Ex 12:12 'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments-- I am the LORD.
02Ex 12:13 'And the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy [you] when I strike the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:14 'Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it [as] a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it [as] a permanent ordinance.
02Ex 12:15 'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
02Ex 12:16 'And on the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and [another] holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you.
02Ex 12:17 'You shall also observe the [Feast of] Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.
02Ex 12:18 'In the first [month,] on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
02Ex 12:19 'Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether [he is] an alien or a native of the land.
02Ex 12:20 'You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.' "
02Ex 12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover [lamb.]
02Ex 12:22 "And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.
02Ex 12:23 "For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite [you.]
02Ex 12:24 "And you shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever.
02Ex 12:25 "And it will come about when you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, that you shall observe this rite.
02Ex 12:26 "And it will come about when your children will say to you, 'What does this rite mean to you?'
02Ex 12:27 that you shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but spared our homes.' "And the people bowed low and worshiped.
02Ex 12:28 Then the sons of Israel went and did [so;] just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
02Ex 12:29 Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of cattle.
02Ex 12:30 And Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.
02Ex 12:31 Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said.
02Ex 12:32 "Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also."
02Ex 12:33 And the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We shall all be dead."
02Ex 12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, [with] their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.
02Ex 12:35 Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;
02Ex 12:36 and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
02Ex 12:37 Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.
02Ex 12:38 And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.
02Ex 12:39 And they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
02Ex 12:40 Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
02Ex 12:41 And it came about at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:42 It is a night to be observed for the LORD for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.
02Ex 12:43 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover£º no foreigner is to eat of it;
02Ex 12:44 but every man's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it.
02Ex 12:45 "A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it.
02Ex 12:46 "It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it.
02Ex 12:47 "All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this.
02Ex 12:48 "But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat of it.
02Ex 12:49 "The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you."
02Ex 12:50 Then all the sons of Israel did [so;] they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:51 And it came about on that same day that the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
02Ex 13:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 13:2 "Sanctify to Me every first-born, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me."
02Ex 13:3 And Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
02Ex 13:4 "On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth.
02Ex 13:5 "And it shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall observe this rite in this month.
02Ex 13:6 "For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
02Ex 13:7 "Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your borders.
02Ex 13:8 "And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
02Ex 13:9 "And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
02Ex 13:10 "Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year.
02Ex 13:11 "Now it shall come about when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,
02Ex 13:12 that you shall devote to the LORD the first offspring of every womb, and the first offspring of every beast that you own; the males belong to the LORD.
02Ex 13:13 "But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem [it,] then you shall break its neck; and every first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem.
02Ex 13:14 "And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ' What is this? 'then you shall say to him,' With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
02Ex 13:15 'And it came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man and the first-born of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every first-born of my sons I redeem.'
02Ex 13:16 "So it shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."
02Ex 13:17 Now it came about when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, "Lest the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt."
02Ex 13:18 Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt.
02Ex 13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God shall surely take care of you; and you shall carry my bones from here with you."
02Ex 13:20 Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
02Ex 13:21 And the LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
02Ex 13:22 He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
02Ex 14:1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 14:2 "Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea.
02Ex 14:3 "For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
02Ex 14:4 "Thus I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." And they did so.
02Ex 14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
02Ex 14:6 So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him;
02Ex 14:7 and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the [other] chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
02Ex 14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly.
02Ex 14:9 Then the Egyptians chased after them [with] all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
02Ex 14:10 And as Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.
02Ex 14:11 Then they said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?
02Ex 14:12 "Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
02Ex 14:13 But Moses said to the people, "Do not fear! Stand by and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
02Ex 14:14 "The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent."
02Ex 14:15 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward.
02Ex 14:16 "And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land.
02Ex 14:17 "And as for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
02Ex 14:18 "Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen."
02Ex 14:19 And the angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
02Ex 14:20 So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.
02Ex 14:21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea [back] by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.
02Ex 14:22 And the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters [were like] a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
02Ex 14:23 Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.
02Ex 14:24 And it came about at the morning watch, that the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion.
02Ex 14:25 And He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians."
02Ex 14:26 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen."
02Ex 14:27 So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
02Ex 14:28 And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.
02Ex 14:29 But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters [were like] a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
02Ex 14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
02Ex 14:31 And when Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses.
02Ex 15:1 Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said, "I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
02Ex 15:2 "The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; This is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will extol Him.
02Ex 15:3 "The LORD is a warrior; The LORD is His name.
02Ex 15:4 "Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
02Ex 15:5 "The deeps cover them; They went down into the depths like a stone.
02Ex 15:6 "Thy right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power, Thy right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.
02Ex 15:7 "And in the greatness of Thine excellence Thou dost overthrow those who rise up against Thee; Thou dost send forth Thy burning anger, [and] it consumes them as chaff.
02Ex 15:8 "And at the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The flowing waters stood up like a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
02Ex 15:9 "The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be gratified against them; I will draw out my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
02Ex 15:10 "Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02Ex 15:11 "Who is like Thee among the gods, O LORD? Who is like Thee, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?
02Ex 15:12 "Thou didst stretch out Thy right hand, The earth swallowed them.
02Ex 15:13 "In Thy lovingkindness Thou hast led the people whom Thou hast redeemed; In Thy strength Thou hast guided [them] to Thy holy habitation.
02Ex 15:14 "The peoples have heard, they tremble; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
02Ex 15:15 "Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
02Ex 15:16 "Terror and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of Thine arm they are motionless as stone; Until Thy people pass over, O LORD, Until the people pass over whom Thou hast purchased.
02Ex 15:17 "Thou wilt bring them and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, The place, O LORD, which Thou hast made for Thy dwelling, The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.
02Ex 15:18 "The LORD shall reign forever and ever."
02Ex 15:19 For the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.
02Ex 15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.
02Ex 15:21 And Miriam answered them, "Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea."
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
02Ex 15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah.
02Ex 15:24 So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
02Ex 15:25 Then he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; and he threw [it] into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them.
02Ex 15:26 And He said, "If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer."
02Ex 15:27 Then they came to Elim where there [were] twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.
02Ex 16:1 Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
02Ex 16:2 And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
02Ex 16:3 And the sons of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
02Ex 16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction.
02Ex 16:5 "And it will come about on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, "At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt;
02Ex 16:7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD; and what are we, that you grumble against us? "
02Ex 16:8 And Moses said, "[This will happen] when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD. "
02Ex 16:9 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.'"
02Ex 16:10 And it came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
02Ex 16:11 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 16:12 "I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
02Ex 16:13 So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
02Ex 16:14 When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.
02Ex 16:15 When the sons of Israel saw [it,] they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.
02Ex 16:16 "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.'"
02Ex 16:17 And the sons of Israel did so, and [some] gathered much and [some] little.
02Ex 16:18 When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat.
02Ex 16:19 And Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it until morning."
02Ex 16:20 But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.
02Ex 16:21 And they gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the sun grew hot, it would melt.
02Ex 16:22 Now it came about on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
02Ex 16:23 then he said to them, "This is what the LORD meant£º Tomorrow is a sabbath observance, a holy sabbath to the LORD. Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning."
02Ex 16:24 So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul, nor was there any worm in it.
02Ex 16:25 And Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
02Ex 16:26 "Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, [the] sabbath, there will be none."
02Ex 16:27 And it came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
02Ex 16:28 Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions?
02Ex 16:29 "See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
02Ex 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
02Ex 16:31 And the house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.
02Ex 16:32 Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 16:33 And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations."
02Ex 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept.
02Ex 16:35 And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
02Ex 16:36 (Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
02Ex 17:1 Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
02Ex 17:2 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water that we may drink." And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?"
02Ex 17:3 But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, "Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"
02Ex 17:4 So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "What shall I do to this people? A little more and they will stone me."
02Ex 17:5 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
02Ex 17:6 "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02Ex 17:7 And he named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us, or not?"
02Ex 17:8 Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.
02Ex 17:9 So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."
02Ex 17:10 And Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
02Ex 17:11 So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.
02Ex 17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set.
02Ex 17:13 So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
02Ex 17:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial, and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
02Ex 17:15 And Moses built an altar, and named it The LORD is My Banner;
02Ex 17:16 and he said, "The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation."
02Ex 18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02Ex 18:2 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Moses' wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away,
02Ex 18:3 and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
02Ex 18:4 And the other was named Eliezer, for [he said,] "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
02Ex 18:5 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God.
02Ex 18:6 And he sent word to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her."
02Ex 18:7 Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and went into the tent.
02Ex 18:8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and [how] the LORD had delivered them.
02Ex 18:9 And Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:10 So Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, [and] who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:11 "Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people."
02Ex 18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law before God.
02Ex 18:13 And it came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening.
02Ex 18:14 Now when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit [as judge] and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"
02Ex 18:15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
02Ex 18:16 "When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and make known the statutes of God and His laws."
02Ex 18:17 And Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you are doing is not good.
02Ex 18:18 "You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.
02Ex 18:19 "Now listen to me£º I shall give you counsel, and God be with you. You be the people's representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God,
02Ex 18:20 then teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk, and the work they are to do.
02Ex 18:21 "Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place [ these] over them, [as] leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
02Ex 18:22 "And let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear [the burden] with you.
02Ex 18:23 "If you do this thing and God [so] commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace."
02Ex 18:24 So Moses listened to his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
02Ex 18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.
02Ex 18:26 And they judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge.
02Ex 18:27 Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land.
02Ex 19:1 In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
02Ex 19:2 When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain.
02Ex 19:3 And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel£º
02Ex 19:4 'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and [how] I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself.
02Ex 19:5 'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;
02Ex 19:6 and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. 'These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel. "
02Ex 19:7 So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 19:8 And all the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do!" And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD.
02Ex 19:9 And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I shall come to you in a thick cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe in you forever." Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
02Ex 19:10 The LORD also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments;
02Ex 19:11 and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
02Ex 19:12 "And you shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 19:13 'No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.' When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain. "
02Ex 19:14 So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments.
02Ex 19:15 And he said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."
02Ex 19:16 So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who [were] in the camp trembled.
02Ex 19:17 And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 19:18 Now Mount Sinai [was] all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
02Ex 19:19 When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.
02Ex 19:20 And the LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
02Ex 19:21 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
02Ex 19:22 "And also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them."
02Ex 19:23 And Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for Thou didst warn us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it.'"
02Ex 19:24 Then the LORD said to him, "Go down and come up [again,] you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break forth upon them."
02Ex 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
02Ex 20:1 Then God spoke all these words, saying,
02Ex 20:2 "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
02Ex 20:3 "You shall have no other gods before Me.
02Ex 20:4 "You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
02Ex 20:5 "You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,
02Ex 20:6 but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
02Ex 20:7 "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
02Ex 20:8 "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
02Ex 20:9 "Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; [in it] you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you.
02Ex 20:11 "For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.
02Ex 20:12 "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
02Ex 20:13 "You shall not murder.
02Ex 20:14 "You shall not commit adultery.
02Ex 20:15 "You shall not steal.
02Ex 20:16 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
02Ex 20:17 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
02Ex 20:18 And all the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw [it,] they trembled and stood at a distance.
02Ex 20:19 Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, lest we die."
02Ex 20:20 And Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin."
02Ex 20:21 So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God [was.]
02Ex 20:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.
02Ex 20:23 'You shall not make [other gods] besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.
02Ex 20:24 'You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
02Ex 20:25 'And if you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.
02Ex 20:26 'And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.'
02Ex 21:1 "Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them.
02Ex 21:2 "If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment.
02Ex 21:3 "If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him.
02Ex 21:4 "If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone.
02Ex 21:5 "But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,'
02Ex 21:6 then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently.
02Ex 21:7 "And if a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do.
02Ex 21:8 "If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her.
02Ex 21:9 "And if he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters.
02Ex 21:10 "If he takes to himself another woman, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights.
02Ex 21:11 "And if he will not do these three [things] for her, then she shall go out for nothing, without [payment of] money.
02Ex 21:12 "He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 21:13 "But if he did not lie in wait [for him,] but God let [him] fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee.
02Ex 21:14 "If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him [even] from My altar, that he may die.
02Ex 21:15 "And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 21:16 "And he who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 21:17 "And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 21:18 "And if men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with [his] fist, and he does not die but remains in bed;
02Ex 21:19 if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and shall take care of him until he is completely healed.
02Ex 21:20 "And if a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished.
02Ex 21:21 "If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property.
02Ex 21:22 "And [if] men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no [further] injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges [decide.]
02Ex 21:23 "But if there is [any further] injury, then you shall appoint [as a penalty] life for life,
02Ex 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02Ex 21:25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
02Ex 21:26 "And if a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye.
02Ex 21:27 "And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.
02Ex 21:28 "And if an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall go unpunished.
02Ex 21:29 "If, however, an ox was previously in the habit of goring, and its owner has been warned, yet he does not confine it, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
02Ex 21:30 "If a ransom is demanded of him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is demanded of him.
02Ex 21:31 "Whether it gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule.

02Ex 21:35 "And if one man's ox hurts another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price equally; and also they shall divide the dead [ox.]

02Ex 22:2 "If the thief is caught while breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness on his account.
02Ex 22:3 "[But] if the sun has risen on him, there will be bloodguiltiness on his account. He shall surely make restitution; if he owns nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
02Ex 22:4 "If what he stole is actually found alive in his possession, whether an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall pay double.

02Ex 22:6 "If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, so that stacked grain or the standing grain or the field [itself] is consumed, he who started the fire shall surely make restitution.
02Ex 22:7 "If a man gives his neighbor money or goods to keep [for him,] and it is stolen from the man's house, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double.
02Ex 22:8 "If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house shall appear before the judges, [to] determine whether he laid his hands on his neighbor's property.
02Ex 22:9 "For every breach of trust, [whether it is] for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, [or] for any lost thing about which one says, 'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.
02Ex 22:10 "If a man gives his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep [for him,] and it dies or is hurt or is driven away while no one is looking,
02Ex 22:11 an oath before the LORD shall be made by the two of them, that he has not laid hands on his neighbor's property; and its owner shall accept [it,] and he shall not make restitution.

02Ex 22:15 "If its owner is with it, he shall not make restitution; if it is hired, it came for its hire.
02Ex 22:16 "And if a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her [to be] his wife.

02Ex 22:25 "If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest.
02Ex 22:26 "If you ever take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets,
02Ex 22:27 for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body. What else shall he sleep in? And it shall come about that when he cries out to Me, I will hear [him,] for I am gracious.
02Ex 22:28 "You shall not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
02Ex 22:29 "You shall not delay [the offering from] your harvest and your vintage. The first-born of your sons you shall give to Me.

02Ex 23:7 "Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty.
02Ex 23:8 "And you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just.
02Ex 23:9 "And you shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you [also] were strangers in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 23:10 "And you shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield,
02Ex 23:11 but [on] the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the needy of your people may eat; and whatever they leave the beast of the field may eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard [and] your olive grove.
02Ex 23:12 "Six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease [from labor] in order that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave, as well as your stranger, may refresh themselves.
02Ex 23:13 "Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; and do not mention the name of other gods, nor let [them] be heard from your mouth.
02Ex 23:14 "Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me.
02Ex 23:15 "You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. And none shall appear before Me empty-handed.
02Ex 23:16 "Also [you shall observe] the Feast of the Harvest [of] the first fruits of your labors [from] what you sow in the field; also the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in [the fruit of] your labors from the field.

02Ex 23:19 "You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. You are not to boil a kid in the milk of its mother.
02Ex 23:20 "Behold, I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
02Ex 23:21 "Be on your guard before him and obey his voice; do not be rebellious toward him, for he will not pardon your transgression, since My name is in him.
02Ex 23:22 "But if you will truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.
02Ex 23:23 "For My angel will go before you and bring you in to [the land of] the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will completely destroy them.
02Ex 23:24 "You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you shall utterly overthrow them, and break their [sacred] pillars in pieces.

02Ex 23:26 "There shall be no one miscarrying or barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
02Ex 23:27 "I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn [their] backs to you.
02Ex 23:28 "And I will send hornets ahead of you, that they may drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites before you.
02Ex 23:29 "I will not drive them out before you in a single year, that the land may not become desolate, and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.
02Ex 23:30 "I will drive them out before you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land.
02Ex 23:31 "And I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River [Euphrates;] for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.
02Ex 23:32 "You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
02Ex 23:33 "They shall not live in your land, lest they make you sin against Me; for [if] you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."
02Ex 24:1 Then He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance.
02Ex 24:2 "Moses alone, however, shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him."
02Ex 24:3 Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!"
02Ex 24:4 And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
02Ex 24:5 And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
02Ex 24:6 And Moses took half of the blood and put [it] in basins, and the [other] half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
02Ex 24:7 Then he took the book of the covenant and read [it] in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!"
02Ex 24:8 So Moses took the blood and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, " Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words. "
02Ex 24:9 Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
02Ex 24:10 and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.
02Ex 24:11 Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they beheld God, and they ate and drank.
02Ex 24:12 Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction."
02Ex 24:13 So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God.
02Ex 24:14 But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them."
02Ex 24:15 Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
02Ex 24:16 And the glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.
02Ex 24:17 And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top.
02Ex 24:18 And Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
02Ex 25:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for Me; from every man whose heart moves him you shall raise My contribution.
02Ex 25:3 "And this is the contribution which you are to raise from them£º gold, silver and bronze,

02Ex 25:8 "And let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may dwell among them.
02Ex 25:9 "According to all that I am going to show you, [as] the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, just so you shall construct [it.]
02Ex 25:10 "And they shall construct an ark of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high.
02Ex 25:11 "And you shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and you shall make a gold molding around it.
02Ex 25:12 "And you shall cast four gold rings for it, and fasten them on its four feet, and two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side of it.
02Ex 25:13 "And you shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
02Ex 25:14 "And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark with them.
02Ex 25:15 "The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it.
02Ex 25:16 "And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.
02Ex 25:17 "And you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
02Ex 25:18 "And you shall make two cherubim of gold, make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat.
02Ex 25:19 "And make one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; you shall make the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat at its two ends.
02Ex 25:20 "And the cherubim shall have [their] wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings and facing one another; the faces of the cherubim are to be [turned] toward the mercy seat.
02Ex 25:21 "And you shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I shall give to you.
02Ex 25:22 "And there I will meet with you; and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about all that I will give you in commandment for the sons of Israel.
02Ex 25:23 "And you shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long and one cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.
02Ex 25:24 "And you shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold border around it.
02Ex 25:25 "And you shall make for it a rim of a handbreadth around [it;] and you shall make a gold border for the rim around it.
02Ex 25:26 "And you shall make four gold rings for it and put rings on the four corners which are on its four feet.
02Ex 25:27 "The rings shall be close to the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table.
02Ex 25:28 "And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that with them the table may be carried.
02Ex 25:29 "And you shall make its dishes and its pans and its jars and its bowls, with which to pour libations; you shall make them of pure gold.
02Ex 25:30 "And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before Me at all times.
02Ex 25:31 "Then you shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand [and] its base and its shaft are to be made of hammered work; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers shall be [of one piece] with it.
02Ex 25:32 "And six branches shall go out from its sides; three branches of the lampstand from its one side, and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.

02Ex 30:11 The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 30:12 "When you take a census of the sons of Israel to number them, then each one of them shall give a ransom for himself to the LORD, when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them.

02Ex 30:18 "You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
02Ex 30:19 "And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it;

02Ex 30:21 "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die; and it shall be a perpetual statute for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations."
02Ex 30:22 Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 30:23 "Take also for yourself the finest of spices£º of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels,] and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant cane two hundred and fifty,

02Ex 30:25 "And you shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
02Ex 30:26 "And with it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,
02Ex 30:27 and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,

02Ex 30:33 'Whoever shall mix [any] like it, or whoever puts any of it on a layman, shall be cut off from his people.' "
02Ex 30:34 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each.
02Ex 30:35 "And with it you shall make incense, a perfume, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, [and] holy.
02Ex 30:36 "And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I shall meet with you; it shall be most holy to you.
02Ex 30:37 "And the incense which you shall make, you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD.
02Ex 30:38 "Whoever shall make [any] like it, to use as perfume, shall be cut off from his people."
02Ex 31:1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 31:2 "See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 31:3 "And I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all [kinds of] craftsmanship,

02Ex 31:6 "And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill, that they may make all that I have commanded you£º

02Ex 31:9 the altar of burnt offering also with all its utensils, and the laver and its stand,
02Ex 31:10 the woven garments as well, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, [with which] to carry on their priesthood;
02Ex 31:11 the anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the holy place, they are to make [them] according to all that I have commanded you. "
02Ex 31:12 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 31:13 "But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for [this] is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
02Ex 31:14 'Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.
02Ex 31:15 'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 31:16 'So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.'
02Ex 31:17 "It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased [ from labor,] and was refreshed."
02Ex 31:18 And when He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.
02Ex 32:1 Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
02Ex 32:2 And Aaron said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring [them] to me."
02Ex 32:3 Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears, and brought [them] to Aaron.
02Ex 32:4 And he took [this] from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it into a molten calf; and they said, "This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."
02Ex 32:5 Now when Aaron saw [this,] he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow [shall be] a feast to the LORD."
02Ex 32:6 So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
02Ex 32:7 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted [themselves.]
02Ex 32:8 "They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!'"
02Ex 32:9 And the LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people.
02Ex 32:10 "Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them, and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation."
02Ex 32:11 Then Moses entreated the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why doth Thine anger burn against Thy people whom Thou hast brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
02Ex 32:12 "Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'With evil [intent] He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? Turn from Thy burning anger and change Thy mind about [doing] harm to Thy people.
02Ex 32:13 "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants to whom Thou didst swear by Thyself, and didst say to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit [it] forever.' "
02Ex 32:14 So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.
02Ex 32:15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one [side] and the other.
02Ex 32:16 And the tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing engraved on the tablets.
02Ex 32:17 Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp."
02Ex 32:18 But he said, "It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, Nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; But the sound of singing I hear."
02Ex 32:19 And it came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and [the] dancing; and Moses' anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 32:20 And he took the calf which they had made and burned [it] with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water, and made the sons of Israel drink [it.]
02Ex 32:21 Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought [such] great sin upon them?"
02Ex 32:22 And Aaron said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil.
02Ex 32:23 "For they said to me, 'Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
02Ex 32:24 "And I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.' So they gave [it] to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
02Ex 32:25 Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control-- for Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies--
02Ex 32:26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, [come] to me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.
02Ex 32:27 And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Every man [of you] put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'"
02Ex 32:28 So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
02Ex 32:29 Then Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD-- for every man has been against his son and against his brother-- in order that He may bestow a blessing upon you today."
02Ex 32:30 And it came about on the next day that Moses said to the people, " You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the LORD, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin. "
02Ex 32:31 Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves.
02Ex 32:32 "But now, if Thou wilt, forgive their sin-- and if not, please blot me out from Thy book which Thou hast written!"
02Ex 32:33 And the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.
02Ex 32:34 "But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
02Ex 32:35 Then the LORD smote the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aaron had made.
02Ex 33:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.'
02Ex 33:2 "And I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.
02Ex 33:3 "[Go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are an obstinate people, lest I destroy you on the way."
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments.
02Ex 33:5 For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the sons of Israel, 'You are an obstinate people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I will do with you.'"
02Ex 33:6 So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb [onward.]
02Ex 33:7 Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting. And it came about, that everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
02Ex 33:8 And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent.
02Ex 33:9 And it came about, whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses.
02Ex 33:10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent.
02Ex 33:11 Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
02Ex 33:12 Then Moses said to the LORD, "See, Thou dost say to me, 'Bring up this people!' But Thou Thyself hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Moreover, Thou hast said, 'I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.'
02Ex 33:13 "Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found favor in Thy sight, let me know Thy ways, that I may know Thee, so that I may find favor in Thy sight. Consider too, that this nation is Thy people."
02Ex 33:14 And He said, "My presence shall go [with you,] and I will give you rest."
02Ex 33:15 Then he said to Him, "If Thy presence does not go [with us,] do not lead us up from here.
02Ex 33:16 "For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Thy sight, I and Thy people? Is it not by Thy going with us, so that we, I and Thy people, may be distinguished from all the [other] people who are upon the face of the earth?"
02Ex 33:17 And the LORD said to Moses, "I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight, and I have known you by name."
02Ex 33:18 Then Moses said, "I pray Thee, show me Thy glory!"
02Ex 33:19 And He said, "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."
02Ex 33:20 But He said, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!"
02Ex 33:21 Then the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand [there] on the rock;
02Ex 33:22 and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
02Ex 33:23 "Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen."
02Ex 34:1 Now the LORD said to Moses, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered.
02Ex 34:2 "So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain.
02Ex 34:3 "And no man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain."
02Ex 34:4 So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand.
02Ex 34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD.
02Ex 34:6 Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth;
02Ex 34:7 who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave [the guilty] unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations. "
02Ex 34:8 And Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship.
02Ex 34:9 And he said, "If now I have found favor in Thy sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate; and do Thou pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Thine own possession."
02Ex 34:10 Then God said, "Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you.
02Ex 34:11 "Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day£º behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.
02Ex 34:12 "Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, lest it become a snare in your midst.
02Ex 34:13 "But [rather,] you are to tear down their altars and smash their [ sacred] pillars and cut down their Asherim
02Ex 34:14 --for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God--
02Ex 34:15 lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they play the harlot with their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and someone invite you to eat of his sacrifice;
02Ex 34:16 and you take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters play the harlot with their gods, and cause your sons [also] to play the harlot with their gods.
02Ex 34:17 "You shall make for yourself no molten gods.
02Ex 34:18 "You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
02Ex 34:19 "The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, and all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep.
02Ex 34:20 "And you shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from a donkey; and if you do not redeem [it,] then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the first-born of your sons. And none shall appear before Me empty-handed.
02Ex 34:21 "You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; [ even] during plowing time and harvest you shall rest.
02Ex 34:22 "And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, [that is,] the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
02Ex 34:23 "Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
02Ex 34:24 "For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
02Ex 34:25 "You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning.
02Ex 34:26 "You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
02Ex 34:27 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
02Ex 34:28 So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
02Ex 34:29 And it came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony [were] in Moses' hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him.
02Ex 34:30 So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
02Ex 34:31 Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.
02Ex 34:32 And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them [to do] everything that the LORD had spoken to him on Mount Sinai.
02Ex 34:33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
02Ex 34:34 But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded,
02Ex 34:35 the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone. So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.
02Ex 35:1 Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded [you] to do.
02Ex 35:2 "For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy [day,] a sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
02Ex 35:3 "You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day."
02Ex 35:4 And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,
02Ex 35:5 'Take from among you a contribution to the LORD; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the Lord's contribution£º gold, silver, and bronze,
02Ex 35:6 and blue, purple and scarlet [material,] fine linen, goats' [hair,]
02Ex 35:7 and rams' skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,
02Ex 35:8 and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense,
02Ex 35:9 and onyx stones and setting stones, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
02Ex 35:10 'And let every skillful man among you come, and make all that the LORD has commanded£º
02Ex 35:11 the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
02Ex 35:12 the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain of the screen;
02Ex 35:13 the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 35:14 the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light;
02Ex 35:15 and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle;
02Ex 35:16 the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;
02Ex 35:17 the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
02Ex 35:18 the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords;
02Ex 35:19 the woven garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests. '"
02Ex 35:20 Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses' presence.
02Ex 35:21 And everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came [and] brought the Lord's contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.
02Ex 35:22 Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came [and] brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so [did] every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD.
02Ex 35:23 And every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet [material] and fine linen and goats' [hair] and rams' skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them.
02Ex 35:24 Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the Lord's contribution; and every man, who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
02Ex 35:25 And all the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, [in] blue and purple [and] scarlet [material] and [in] fine linen.
02Ex 35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' [hair.]
02Ex 35:27 And the rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece;
02Ex 35:28 and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
02Ex 35:29 The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring [material] for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD.
02Ex 35:30 Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 35:31 "And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;
02Ex 35:32 to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze,
02Ex 35:33 and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work.
02Ex 35:34 "He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
02Ex 35:35 "He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple [and] in scarlet [material,] and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs.
02Ex 36:1 "Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the LORD has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 36:2 Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it.
02Ex 36:3 And they received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary. And they still [continued] bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
02Ex 36:4 And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing,
02Ex 36:5 and they said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded [us] to perform."
02Ex 36:6 So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary." Thus the people were restrained from bringing [any more.]
02Ex 36:7 For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it.
02Ex 36:8 And all the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet [material,] with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman, Bezalel made them.
02Ex 36:9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements.
02Ex 36:10 And he joined five curtains to one another, and [the other] five curtains he joined to one another.
02Ex 36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.
02Ex 36:12 He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other.
02Ex 36:13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit.
02Ex 36:14 Then he made curtains of goats' [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all.
02Ex 36:15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements.
02Ex 36:16 And he joined five curtains by themselves, and [the other] six curtains by themselves.
02Ex 36:17 Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the [first] set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain [that was outermost in] the second set.
02Ex 36:18 And he made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together, that it might be a unit.
02Ex 36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above.
02Ex 36:20 Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.
02Ex 36:21 Ten cubits was the length of each board, and one and a half cubits the width of each board.
02Ex 36:22 There were two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:23 And he made the boards for the tabernacle£º twenty boards for the south side;
02Ex 36:24 and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
02Ex 36:25 Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,
02Ex 36:26 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.
02Ex 36:27 And for the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards.
02Ex 36:28 And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.
02Ex 36:29 And they were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners.
02Ex 36:30 And there were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board.
02Ex 36:31 Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle,
02Ex 36:32 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear [side] to the west.
02Ex 36:33 And he made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.
02Ex 36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold [ as] holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
02Ex 36:35 Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet [material,] and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.
02Ex 36:36 And he made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.
02Ex 36:37 And he made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet [material,] and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;
02Ex 36:38 and [he made] its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of bronze.
02Ex 37:1 Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits;
02Ex 37:2 and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around.
02Ex 37:3 And he cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
02Ex 37:4 And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:5 And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry it.
02Ex 37:6 And he made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide.
02Ex 37:7 And he made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work, at the two ends of the mercy seat;
02Ex 37:8 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat at the two ends.
02Ex 37:9 And the cherubim had [their] wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
02Ex 37:10 Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.
02Ex 37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around.
02Ex 37:12 And he made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around, and made a gold molding for its rim all around.
02Ex 37:13 And he cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.
02Ex 37:14 Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table.
02Ex 37:15 And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.
02Ex 37:16 And he made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out libations, of pure gold.
02Ex 37:17 Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were [of one piece] with it.
02Ex 37:18 And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it;
02Ex 37:19 three cups shaped like almond [blossoms,] a bulb and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond [blossoms,] a bulb and a flower in the other branch-- so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
02Ex 37:20 And in the lampstand [there were] four cups shaped like almond [blossoms,] its bulbs and its flowers;
02Ex 37:21 and a bulb was under the [first] pair of branches [coming] out of it, and a bulb under the [second] pair of branches [coming] out of it, and a bulb under the [third] pair of branches [coming] out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.
02Ex 37:22 Their bulbs and their branches were [of one piece] with it; the whole of it [was] a single hammered work of pure gold.
02Ex 37:23 And he made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.
02Ex 37:24 He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
02Ex 37:25 Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood£º a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were [of one piece] with it.
02Ex 37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around.
02Ex 37:27 And he made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides-- on opposite sides-- as holders for poles with which to carry it.
02Ex 37:28 And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.
02Ex 38:1 Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high.
02Ex 38:2 And he made its horns on its four corners, its horns being [of one piece] with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
02Ex 38:3 And he made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze.
02Ex 38:4 And he made for the altar a grating of bronze network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up.
02Ex 38:5 And he cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating [as] holders for the poles.
02Ex 38:6 And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
02Ex 38:7 And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it hollow with planks.
02Ex 38:8 Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
02Ex 38:9 Then he made the court£º for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;
02Ex 38:10 their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, [made] of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands [were] of silver.
02Ex 38:11 And for the north side [there were] one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets [were] of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands [were] of silver.
02Ex 38:12 And for the west side [there were] hangings of fifty cubits [with] their ten pillars and their ten sockets; the hooks of the pillars and their bands [were] of silver.
02Ex 38:13 And for the east side fifty cubits.
02Ex 38:14 The hangings for the [one] side [of the gate were] fifteen cubits, [ with] their three pillars and their three sockets,
02Ex 38:15 and so for the other side. On both sides of the gate of the court [ were] hangings of fifteen cubits, [with] their three pillars and their three sockets.
02Ex 38:16 All the hangings of the court all around [were] of fine twisted linen.
02Ex 38:17 And the sockets for the pillars [were] of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were furnished with silver bands.
02Ex 38:18 And the screen of the gate of the court was the work of the weaver, of blue and purple and scarlet [material], and fine twisted linen. And the length was twenty cubits and the height was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
02Ex 38:19 And their four pillars and their four sockets [were] of bronze; their hooks [were] of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their bands [were] of silver.
02Ex 38:20 And all the pegs of the tabernacle and of the court all around [were] of bronze.
02Ex 38:21 This is the number of [the things for] the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were numbered according to the command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
02Ex 38:22 Now Bezalel, the son of Uri the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 38:23 And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet [material,] and fine linen.
02Ex 38:24 All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
02Ex 38:25 And the silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was 100 talents and 17755 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;
02Ex 38:26 a beka a head ([that is,] half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for each one who passed over to those who were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for 6035500 men.
02Ex 38:27 And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
02Ex 38:28 And of the 17755 [shekels,] he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them.
02Ex 38:29 And the bronze of the wave offering was 70 talents, and 24000 shekels.
02Ex 38:30 And with it he made the sockets to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar,
02Ex 38:31 and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around.
02Ex 39:1 Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet [material,] they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place, as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, [and] of blue and purple and scarlet [material,] and fine twisted linen.
02Ex 39:3 Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut [them] into threads to be woven in [with] the blue and the purple and the scarlet [material,] and the fine linen, the work of a skillful workman.
02Ex 39:4 They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two [upper] ends.
02Ex 39:5 And the skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material£º of gold [and] of blue and purple and scarlet [material,] and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:6 And they made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree [settings;] they were engraved [like] the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.
02Ex 39:7 And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, [as] memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:8 And he made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod£º of gold [and] of blue and purple and scarlet [material] and fine twisted linen.
02Ex 39:9 It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double.
02Ex 39:10 And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row [was] a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald;
02Ex 39:11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;
02Ex 39:12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
02Ex 39:13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set in gold filigree [settings] when they were mounted.
02Ex 39:14 And the stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, [engraved with] the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes.
02Ex 39:15 And they made on the breastpiece chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold.
02Ex 39:16 And they made two gold filigree [settings] and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.
02Ex 39:17 Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece.
02Ex 39:18 And they put the [other] two ends of the two cords on the two filigree [settings,] and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it.
02Ex 39:19 And they made two gold rings and placed [them] on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod.
02Ex 39:20 Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod.
02Ex 39:21 And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, that it might be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece might not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:22 Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;
02Ex 39:23 and the opening of the robe was [at the top] in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, that it might not be torn.
02Ex 39:24 And they made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet [material and] twisted [linen] on the hem of the robe.
02Ex 39:25 They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe,
02Ex 39:26 alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe, for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:27 And they made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,
02Ex 39:28 and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twisted linen,
02Ex 39:29 and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet [material,] the work of the weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."
02Ex 39:31 And they fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:32 Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
02Ex 39:33 And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings£º its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets;
02Ex 39:34 and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the screening veil;
02Ex 39:35 the ark of the testimony and its poles and the mercy seat;
02Ex 39:36 the table, all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 39:37 the pure [gold] lampstand, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
02Ex 39:38 and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the veil for the doorway of the tent;
02Ex 39:39 the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its stand;
02Ex 39:40 the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
02Ex 39:41 the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.
02Ex 39:42 So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:43 And Moses examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, this they had done. So Moses blessed them.
02Ex 40:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
02Ex 40:2 "On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
02Ex 40:3 "And you shall place the ark of the testimony there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
02Ex 40:4 "And you shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps.
02Ex 40:5 "Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:6 "And you shall set the altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
02Ex 40:7 "And you shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
02Ex 40:8 "And you shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court.
02Ex 40:9 "Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy.
02Ex 40:10 "And you shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; and the altar shall be most holy.
02Ex 40:11 "And you shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it.
02Ex 40:12 "Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
02Ex 40:13 "And you shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as a priest to Me.
02Ex 40:14 "And you shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;
02Ex 40:15 and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priests to Me; and their anointing shall qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations. "
02Ex 40:16 Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did.
02Ex 40:17 Now it came about in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was erected.
02Ex 40:18 And Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets, and set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars.
02Ex 40:19 And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:20 Then he took the testimony and put [it] into the ark, and attached the poles to the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark.
02Ex 40:21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up a veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:22 Then he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
02Ex 40:23 And he set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:24 Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:26 Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil;
02Ex 40:27 and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:28 Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:29 And he set the altar of burnt offering [before] the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:30 And he placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing.
02Ex 40:31 And from it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet.
02Ex 40:32 When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:33 And he erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the veil for the gateway of the court. Thus Moses finished the work.
02Ex 40:34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:35 And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:36 And throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out;
02Ex 40:37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up.
02Ex 40:38 For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.

03Lv 1:1 Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,

03Lv 7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings,
03Lv 7:38 which the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to present their offerings to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.
03Lv 8:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 8:2 "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread;
03Lv 8:3 and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting. "
03Lv 8:4 So Moses did just as the LORD commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting,
03Lv 8:5 Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded to do."
03Lv 8:6 Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near, and washed them with water.
03Lv 8:7 And he put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the artistic band of the ephod, with which he tied [it] to him.
03Lv 8:8 He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.
03Lv 8:9 He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:10 Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
03Lv 8:11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
03Lv 8:12 Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
03Lv 8:13 Next Moses had Aaron's sons come near and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with sashes, and bound caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
03Lv 8:15 Next Moses slaughtered [it] and took the blood and with his finger put [some of it] around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out [the rest of] the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
03Lv 8:16 He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar.
03Lv 8:17 But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse, he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:18 Then he presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
03Lv 8:19 And Moses slaughtered [it] and sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
03Lv 8:20 When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke.
03Lv 8:21 After he had washed the entrails and the legs with water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:22 Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
03Lv 8:23 And Moses slaughtered [it] and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
03Lv 8:24 He also had Aaron's sons come near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then sprinkled [the rest of] the blood around on the altar.
03Lv 8:25 And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
03Lv 8:26 And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread [mixed with] oil and one wafer, and placed [them] on the portions of fat and on the right thigh.
03Lv 8:27 He then put all [these] on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons, and presented them as a wave offering before the LORD.
03Lv 8:28 Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to the LORD.
03Lv 8:29 Moses also took the breast and presented it for a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses' portion of the ram of ordination, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:30 So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
03Lv 8:31 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'
03Lv 8:32 "And the remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire.
03Lv 8:33 "And you shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days.
03Lv 8:34 "The LORD has commanded to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf.
03Lv 8:35 "At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that you may not die, for so I have been commanded."
03Lv 8:36 Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD had commanded through Moses.
03Lv 9:1 Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;
03Lv 9:2 and he said to Aaron, "Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, [both] without defect, and offer [them] before the LORD.
03Lv 9:3 "Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, for a burnt offering,
03Lv 9:4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the LORD shall appear to you. '"
03Lv 9:5 So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the LORD.
03Lv 9:6 And Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
03Lv 9:7 Moses then said to Aaron, "Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 9:8 So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
03Lv 9:9 And Aaron's sons presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [some] on the horns of the altar, and poured out [the rest of] the blood at the base of the altar.
03Lv 9:10 The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering, he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 9:11 The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp.
03Lv 9:12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
03Lv 9:13 And they handed the burnt offering to him in pieces with the head, and he offered [them] up in smoke on the altar.
03Lv 9:14 He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered [them] up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.
03Lv 9:15 Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.
03Lv 9:16 He also presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
03Lv 9:17 Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his hand with some of it and offered [it] up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
03Lv 9:18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
03Lv 9:19 As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail, and the [fat] covering, and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver,
03Lv 9:20 they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
03Lv 9:21 But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded.
03Lv 9:22 Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
03Lv 9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
03Lv 9:24 Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw [ it], they shouted and fell on their faces.
03Lv 10:1 Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them.
03Lv 10:2 And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
03Lv 10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "It is what the LORD spoke, saying, ' By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honored. '"So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.
03Lv 10:4 Moses called also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come forward, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp."
03Lv 10:5 So they came forward and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said.
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you may not die, and that He may not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the burning which the LORD has brought about.
03Lv 10:7 "You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the Lord's anointing oil is upon you." So they did according to the word of Moses.
03Lv 10:8 The LORD then spoke to Aaron, saying,
03Lv 10:9 "Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you may not die-- it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations--
03Lv 10:10 and so as to make a distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
03Lv 10:11 and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses. "
03Lv 10:12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that is left over from the Lord's offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
03Lv 10:13 "You shall eat it, moreover, in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due out of the Lord's offerings by fire; for thus I have been commanded.
03Lv 10:14 "The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons' due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
03Lv 10:15 "The thigh offered by lifting up and the breast offered by waving, they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering before the LORD; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just as the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 10:16 But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron's surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,
03Lv 10:17 "Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD.
03Lv 10:18 "Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded."
03Lv 10:19 But Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of the LORD?"
03Lv 10:20 And when Moses heard [that], it seemed good in his sight.
03Lv 11:1 The LORD spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

03Lv 20:27 'Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.' "
03Lv 21:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, 'No one shall defile himself for a [dead] person among his people,
03Lv 21:2 except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother and his father and his son and his daughter and his brother,

03Lv 21:7 'They shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God.
03Lv 21:8 'You shall consecrate him, therefore, for he offers the bread of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy.
03Lv 21:9 'Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire.
03Lv 21:10 'And the priest who is the highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor tear his clothes;
03Lv 21:11 nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself [even] for his father or his mother;
03Lv 21:12 nor shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him£º I am the LORD.
03Lv 21:13 'And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
03Lv 21:14 'A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is profaned by harlotry, these he may not take; but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people;
03Lv 21:15 that he may not profane his offspring among his people£º for I am the LORD who sanctifies him. '"
03Lv 21:16 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 21:17 "Speak to Aaron, saying, 'No man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to offer the bread of his God.
03Lv 21:18 'For no one who has a defect shall approach£º a blind man, or a lame man, or he who has a disfigured [face], or any deformed [limb],

03Lv 21:24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
03Lv 22:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 22:2 "Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy [gifts] of the sons of Israel, which they dedicate to Me, so as not to profane My holy name; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:3 "Say to them, 'If any man among all your descendants throughout your generations approaches the holy [gifts] which the sons of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from before Me. I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:4 'No man, of the descendants of Aaron, who is a leper or who has a discharge, may eat of the holy [gifts] until he is clean. And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse or if a man has a seminal emission,
03Lv 22:5 or if a man touches any teeming things, by which he is made unclean, or any man by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness;
03Lv 22:6 a person who touches any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy [gifts], unless he has bathed his body in water.
03Lv 22:7 'But when the sun sets, he shall be clean, and afterward he shall eat of the holy [gifts], for it is his food.
03Lv 22:8 'He shall not eat [an animal] which dies or is torn [by beasts], becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:9 'They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they may not bear sin because of it, and die thereby because they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
03Lv 22:10 'No layman, however, is to eat the holy [gift]; a sojourner with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy [gift.]
03Lv 22:11 'But if a priest buys a slave as [his] property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food.
03Lv 22:12 'And if a priest's daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the offering of the [gifts.]
03Lv 22:13 'But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no child and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's food; but no layman shall eat of it.
03Lv 22:14 'But if a man eats a holy [gift] unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy [gift] to the priest.
03Lv 22:15 'And they shall not profane the holy [gifts] of the sons of Israel which they offer to the LORD,
03Lv 22:16 and [so] cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy [gifts]; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them. '"
03Lv 22:17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 22:18 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'Any man of the house of Israel or of the aliens in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings, which they present to the LORD for a burnt offering--

03Lv 22:20 'Whatever has a defect, you shall not offer, for it will not be accepted for you.
03Lv 22:21 'And when a man offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it.
03Lv 22:22 'Those [that are] blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore or eczema or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD, nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to the LORD.
03Lv 22:23 'In respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted [ member], you may present it for a freewill offering, but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
03Lv 22:24 'Also anything [with its testicles] bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not offer to the LORD, or sacrifice in your land,
03Lv 22:25 nor shall you accept any such from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect, they shall not be accepted for you. '"
03Lv 22:26 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 22:27 "When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the LORD.
03Lv 22:28 "But, [whether] it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not kill [both] it and its young in one day.
03Lv 22:29 "And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.

03Lv 22:33 who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to be your God£º I am the LORD. "
03Lv 23:1 The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying,
03Lv 23:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'The Lord's appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy convocations-- My appointed times are these£º
03Lv 23:3 'For six days work may be done; but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings.
03Lv 23:4 'These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them.
03Lv 23:5 'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the Lord's Passover.
03Lv 23:6 'Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
03Lv 23:7 'On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.
03Lv 23:8 'But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.' "
03Lv 23:9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 23:10 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.
03Lv 23:11 'And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
03Lv 23:12 'Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD.
03Lv 23:13 'Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the LORD [for] a soothing aroma, with its libation, a fourth of a hin of wine.
03Lv 23:14 'Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
03Lv 23:15 'You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths.
03Lv 23:16 'You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD.
03Lv 23:17 'You shall bring in from your dwelling places two [loaves] of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths [of an ephah]; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD.
03Lv 23:18 'Along with the bread, you shall present seven one year old male lambs without defect, and a bull of the herd, and two rams; they are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their libations, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the LORD.

03Lv 23:20 'The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering with two lambs before the LORD; they are to be holy to the LORD for the priest.
03Lv 23:21 'On this same day you shall make a proclamation as well; you are to have a holy convocation. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a perpetual statute in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
03Lv 23:22 'When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the needy and the alien. I am the LORD your God.' "
03Lv 23:23 Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 23:24 "Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month on the first of the month, you shall have a rest, a reminder by blowing [of trumpets], a holy convocation.
03Lv 23:25 'You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.' "
03Lv 23:26 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 23:27 "On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the LORD.
03Lv 23:28 "Neither shall you do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God.
03Lv 23:29 "If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
03Lv 23:30 "As for any person who does any work on this same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
03Lv 23:31 "You shall do no work at all. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
03Lv 23:32 "It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath."
03Lv 23:33 Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 23:34 "Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'On the fifteenth of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD.
03Lv 23:35 'On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any kind.
03Lv 23:36 'For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall do no laborious work.
03Lv 23:37 'These are the appointed times of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to present offerings by fire to the LORD-- burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and libations, [each] day's matter on its own day--
03Lv 23:38 besides [those of] the sabbaths of the LORD, and besides your gifts, and besides all your votive and freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
03Lv 23:39 'On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day.
03Lv 23:40 'Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
03Lv 23:41 'You shall thus celebrate it [as] a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It [shall be] a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
03Lv 23:42 'You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths,
03Lv 23:43 so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. '"
03Lv 23:44 So Moses declared to the sons of Israel the appointed times of the LORD.
03Lv 24:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 24:2 "Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually.
03Lv 24:3 "Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD continually; [it shall be] a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
03Lv 24:4 "He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure [gold] lampstand before the LORD continually.
03Lv 24:5 "Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths [of an ephah] shall be [in] each cake.
03Lv 24:6 "And you shall set them [in] two rows, six [to] a row, on the pure [ gold] table before the LORD.
03Lv 24:7 "And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be a memorial portion for the bread, [even] an offering by fire to the LORD.
03Lv 24:8 "Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel.
03Lv 24:9 "And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the Lord's offerings by fire, [his] portion forever."
03Lv 24:10 Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp.
03Lv 24:11 And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
03Lv 24:12 And they put him in custody so that the command of the LORD might be made clear to them.
03Lv 24:13 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 24:14 "Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him.
03Lv 24:15 "And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If anyone curses his God, then he shall bear his sin.
03Lv 24:16 'Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The alien as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
03Lv 24:17 'And if a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.
03Lv 24:18 'And the one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good, life for life.
03Lv 24:19 'And if a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him£º
03Lv 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him.
03Lv 24:21 'Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man shall be put to death.
03Lv 24:22 'There shall be one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the LORD your God.' "
03Lv 24:23 Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 25:1 The LORD then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying,
03Lv 25:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the LORD.
03Lv 25:3 'Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop,
03Lv 25:4 but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard.
03Lv 25:5 'Your harvest's aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical year.
03Lv 25:6 'And all of you shall have the sabbath [products] of the land for food; yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you.
03Lv 25:7 'Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.
03Lv 25:8 'You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, [namely,] forty-nine years.
03Lv 25:9 'You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.
03Lv 25:10 'You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.
03Lv 25:11 'You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its aftergrowth, nor gather in [from] its untrimmed vines.
03Lv 25:12 'For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.
03Lv 25:13 'On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.

03Lv 25:22 'When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop, eating [the old] until the ninth year when its crop comes in.
03Lv 25:23 'The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are [but] aliens and sojourners with Me.
03Lv 25:24 'Thus for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.

03Lv 25:49 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
03Lv 25:50 'He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. [It is] like the days of a hired man [that] he shall be with him.

03Lv 26:4 then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
03Lv 26:5 'Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land.
03Lv 26:6 'I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making [you] tremble. I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land.
03Lv 26:7 'But you will chase your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword;
03Lv 26:8 five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
03Lv 26:9 'So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you.
03Lv 26:10 'And you will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new.
03Lv 26:11 'Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject you.
03Lv 26:12 'I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people.
03Lv 26:13 'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that [you] should not be their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect.
03Lv 26:14 'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these commandments,
03Lv 26:15 if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, [and] so break My covenant,
03Lv 26:16 I, in turn, will do this to you£º I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that shall waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you shall sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies shall eat it up.
03Lv 26:17 'And I will set My face against you so that you shall be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when no one is pursuing you.
03Lv 26:18 'If also after these things, you do not obey Me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
03Lv 26:19 'And I will also break down your pride of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.
03Lv 26:20 'And your strength shall be spent uselessly, for your land shall not yield its produce and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.
03Lv 26:21 'If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins.
03Lv 26:22 'And I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which shall bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie deserted.
03Lv 26:23 'And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me,
03Lv 26:24 then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:25 'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy hands.
03Lv 26:26 'When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied.
03Lv 26:27 'Yet if in spite of this, you do not obey Me, but act with hostility against Me,
03Lv 26:28 then I will act with wrathful hostility against you; and I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins.
03Lv 26:29 'Further, you shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters you shall eat.
03Lv 26:30 'I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols; for My soul shall abhor you.
03Lv 26:31 'I will lay waste your cities as well, and will make your sanctuaries desolate; and I will not smell your soothing aromas.
03Lv 26:32 'And I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it shall be appalled over it.
03Lv 26:33 'You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste.
03Lv 26:34 'Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
03Lv 26:35 'All the days of [its] desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it.
03Lv 26:36 'As for those of you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them and even when no one is pursuing, they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall.
03Lv 26:37 'They will therefore stumble over each other as if [running] from the sword, although no one is pursuing; and you will have [no strength] to stand up before your enemies.
03Lv 26:38 'But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies' land will consume you.
03Lv 26:39 'So those of you who may be left will rot away because of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them.
03Lv 26:40 'If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also in their acting with hostility against Me--
03Lv 26:41 I also was acting with hostility against them, to bring them into the land of their enemies-- or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make amends for their iniquity,
03Lv 26:42 then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land.
03Lv 26:43 'For the land shall be abandoned by them, and shall make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, shall be making amends for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and their soul abhorred My statutes.
03Lv 26:44 'Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.
03Lv 26:45 'But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.' "
03Lv 26:46 These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai.
03Lv 27:1 Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
03Lv 27:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man makes a difficult vow, he [shall be valued] according to your valuation of persons belonging to the LORD.
03Lv 27:3 'If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
03Lv 27:4 'Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
03Lv 27:5 'And if it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
03Lv 27:6 'But if [they are] from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
03Lv 27:7 'And if [they are] from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
03Lv 27:8 'But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.
03Lv 27:9 'Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy.
03Lv 27:10 'He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy.
03Lv 27:11 'If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the LORD, then he shall place the animal before the priest.
03Lv 27:12 'And the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.
03Lv 27:13 'But if he should ever [wish to] redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation.
03Lv 27:14 'Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
03Lv 27:15 'Yet if the one who consecrates it should [wish to] redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his.
03Lv 27:16 'Again, if a man consecrates to the LORD part of the fields of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it£º a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.
03Lv 27:17 'If he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.
03Lv 27:18 'If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation.
03Lv 27:19 'And if the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may pass to him.
03Lv 27:20 'Yet if he will not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed;
03Lv 27:21 and when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart; it shall be for the priest as his property.
03Lv 27:22 'Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own property,
03Lv 27:23 then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:24 'In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs.
03Lv 27:25 'Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.
03Lv 27:26 'However, a first-born among animals, which as a first-born belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate it; whether ox or sheep, it is the Lord's.
03Lv 27:27 'But if [it is] among the unclean animals, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation, and add to it one-fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
03Lv 27:28 'Nevertheless, anything which a man sets apart to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own property, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:29 'No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
03Lv 27:30 'Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:31 'If, therefore, a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it.
03Lv 27:32 'And for every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:33 'He is not to be concerned whether [it is] good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; or if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. It shall not be redeemed.' "
03Lv 27:34 These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai.
04
04Nm 1:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
04Nm 1:2 "Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head
04Nm 1:3 from twenty years old and upward, whoever [is able to] go out to war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
04Nm 1:4 "With you, moreover, there shall be a man of each tribe, each one head of his father's household.
04Nm 1:5 "These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you£º of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;

04Nm 1:7 of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
04Nm 1:8 of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;
04Nm 1:9 of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;

04Nm 1:15 of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.
04Nm 1:16 "These are they who were called of the congregation, the leaders of their fathers' tribes; they were the heads of divisions of Israel."
04Nm 1:17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
04Nm 1:18 and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month. Then they registered by ancestry in their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head,
04Nm 1:19 just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 1:20 Now the sons of Reuben, Israel's first-born, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:21 their numbered men, of the tribe of Reuben, [were] 465000.
04Nm 1:22 Of the sons of Simeon, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, their numbered men, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,

04Nm 1:28 Of the sons of Issachar, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:29 their numbered men, of the tribe of Issachar, [were] 544000.
04Nm 1:30 Of the sons of Zebulun, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,

04Nm 1:32 Of the sons of Joseph, [namely,] of the sons of Ephraim, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [ was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:33 their numbered men, of the tribe of Ephraim, [were] 405000.
04Nm 1:34 Of the sons of Manasseh, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:35 their numbered men, of the tribe of Manasseh, [were] 322000.
04Nm 1:36 Of the sons of Benjamin, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:37 their numbered men, of the tribe of Benjamin, [were] 354000.
04Nm 1:38 Of the sons of Dan, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:39 their numbered men, of the tribe of Dan, [were] 627000.
04Nm 1:40 Of the sons of Asher, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:41 their numbered men, of the tribe of Asher, [were] 415000.
04Nm 1:42 Of the sons of Naphtali, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war,
04Nm 1:43 their numbered men, of the tribe of Naphtali, [were] 534000.
04Nm 1:44 These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each of whom was of his father's household.
04Nm 1:45 So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households, from twenty years old and upward, whoever [was able to] go out to war in Israel,
04Nm 1:46 even all the numbered men were 6035500.
04Nm 1:47 The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers' tribe.
04Nm 1:48 For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,
04Nm 1:49 "Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel.
04Nm 1:50 "But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it; they shall also camp around the tabernacle.
04Nm 1:51 "So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death.
04Nm 1:52 "And the sons of Israel shall camp, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard, according to their armies.
04Nm 1:53 "But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony."
04Nm 1:54 Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all which the LORD had commanded Moses, so they did.
04Nm 2:1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
04Nm 2:2 "The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers' households; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance.
04Nm 2:3 "Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise [shall be] of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Judah£º Nahshon the son of Amminadab,
04Nm 2:4 and his army, even their numbered men, 746000.
04Nm 2:5 "And those who camp next to him [shall be] the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar£º Nethanel the son of Zuar,
04Nm 2:6 and his army, even their numbered men, 544000.
04Nm 2:7 "Then [comes] the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun£º Eliab the son of Helon,
04Nm 2:8 and his army, even his numbered men, 574000.
04Nm 2:9 "The total of the numbered men of the camp of Judah£º 1864000, by their armies. They shall set out first.
04Nm 2:10 "On the south side [shall be] the standard of the camp of Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben£º Elizur the son of Shedeur,
04Nm 2:11 and his army, even their numbered men, 465000.
04Nm 2:12 "And those who camp next to him [shall be] the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon£º Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,
04Nm 2:13 and his army, even their numbered men, 593000.
04Nm 2:14 "Then [comes] the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad£º Eliasaph the son of Deuel,
04Nm 2:15 and his army, even their numbered men, 456500.
04Nm 2:16 "The total of the numbered men of the camp of Reuben£º 1514500 by their armies. And they shall set out second.
04Nm 2:17 "Then the tent of meeting shall set out [with] the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; just as they camp, so they shall set out, every man in his place, by their standards.
04Nm 2:18 "On the west side [shall be] the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim [shall be] Elishama the son of Ammihud,
04Nm 2:19 and his army, even their numbered men, 405000.
04Nm 2:20 "And next to him [shall be] the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh£º Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,
04Nm 2:21 and his army, even their numbered men, 322000.
04Nm 2:22 "Then [comes] the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin£º Abidan the son of Gideoni,
04Nm 2:23 and his army, even their numbered men, 354000.
04Nm 2:24 "The total of the numbered men of the camp of Ephraim£º 1081000, by their armies. And they shall set out third.
04Nm 2:25 "On the north side [shall be] the standard of the camp of Dan by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Dan£º Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,
04Nm 2:26 and his army, even their numbered men, 627000.
04Nm 2:27 "And those who camp next to him [shall be] the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher£º Pagiel the son of Ochran,
04Nm 2:28 and his army, even their numbered men, 415000.
04Nm 2:29 "Then [comes] the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali£º Ahira the son of Enan,
04Nm 2:30 and his army, even their numbered men, 534000.
04Nm 2:31 "The total of the numbered men of the camp of Dan, [was] 1576000. They shall set out last by their standards."
04Nm 2:32 These are the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers' households; the total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 6035500.
04Nm 2:33 The Levites, however, were not numbered among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:34 Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, every one by his family, according to his father's household.
04Nm 3:1 Now these are [the records of] the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
04Nm 3:2 These then are the names of the sons of Aaron£º Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04Nm 3:3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to serve as priests.
04Nm 3:4 But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.
04Nm 3:5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 3:6 "Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.
04Nm 3:7 "And they shall perform the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:8 "They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, along with the duties of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:9 "You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel.
04Nm 3:10 "So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes near shall be put to death."
04Nm 3:11 Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 3:12 "Now, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every first-born, the first issue of the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine.
04Nm 3:13 "For all the first-born are Mine; on the day that I struck down all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the first-born in Israel, from man to beast. They shall be Mine; I am the LORD."
04Nm 3:14 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
04Nm 3:15 "Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number."
04Nm 3:16 So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, just as he had been commanded.
04Nm 3:17 These then are the sons of Levi by their names£º Gershon and Kohath and Merari.
04Nm 3:18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families£º Libni and Shimei;
04Nm 3:19 and the sons of Kohath by their families£º Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel;
04Nm 3:20 and the sons of Merari by their families£º Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' households.
04Nm 3:21 Of Gershon [was] the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these [were] the families of the Gershonites.
04Nm 3:22 Their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, [even] their numbered men [were] 75000.
04Nm 3:23 The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward,
04Nm 3:24 and the leader of the fathers' households of the Gershonites [was] Eliasaph the son of Lael.
04Nm 3:25 Now the duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting [involved] the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
04Nm 3:26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the court, which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords, according to all the service concerning them.
04Nm 3:27 And of Kohath [was] the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
04Nm 3:28 In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, [there were] 86000, performing the duties of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:29 The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle,
04Nm 3:30 and the leader of the fathers' households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
04Nm 3:31 Now their duties [involved] the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the screen, and all the service concerning them;
04Nm 3:32 and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest [was] the chief of the leaders of Levi, [and had] the oversight of those who perform the duties of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:33 Of Merari [was] the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these [were] the families of Merari.
04Nm 3:34 Their numbered men in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, [were] 62000.
04Nm 3:35 And the leader of the fathers' households of the families of Merari [was] Zuriel the son of Abihail. They [were] to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:36 Now the appointed duties of the sons of Merari [involved] the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, all its equipment, and the service concerning them,
04Nm 3:37 and the pillars around the court with their sockets and their pegs and their cords.
04Nm 3:38 Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the layman coming near was to be put to death.
04Nm 3:39 All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the LORD by their families, every male from a month old and upward, [were] 220000.
04Nm 3:40 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Number every first-born male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names.
04Nm 3:41 "And you shall take the Levites for Me, I am the LORD, instead of all the first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the first-born among the cattle of the sons of Israel."
04Nm 3:42 So Moses numbered all the first-born among the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded him;
04Nm 3:43 and all the first-born males by the number of names from a month old and upward, for their numbered men were 222733.
04Nm 3:44 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 3:45 "Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am the LORD.
04Nm 3:46 "And for the ransom of the 273 of the first-born of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites,
04Nm 3:47 you shall take five shekels apiece, per head; you shall take [them] in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs),
04Nm 3:48 and give the money, the ransom of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons. "
04Nm 3:49 So Moses took the ransom money from those who were in excess, beyond those ransomed by the Levites;
04Nm 3:50 from the first-born of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 13655.
04Nm 3:51 Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 4:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
04Nm 4:2 "Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' households,
04Nm 4:3 from thirty years and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:4 "This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of meeting, [concerning] the most holy things.
04Nm 4:5 "When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it;
04Nm 4:6 and they shall lay a covering of porpoise skin on it, and shall spread over [it] a cloth of pure blue, and shall insert its poles.
04Nm 4:7 "Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the pans and the sacrificial bowls and the jars for the libation, and the continual bread shall be on it.
04Nm 4:8 "And they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet [material,] and cover the same with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its poles.
04Nm 4:9 "Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps and its snuffers, and its trays and all its oil vessels, by which they serve it;
04Nm 4:10 and they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying bars.
04Nm 4:11 "And over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall insert its poles;
04Nm 4:12 and they shall take all the utensils of service, with which they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and put them on the carrying bars.
04Nm 4:13 "Then they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.
04Nm 4:14 "They shall also put on it all its utensils by which they serve in connection with it£º the firepans, the forks and shovels and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a cover of porpoise skin over it and insert its poles.
04Nm 4:15 "And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy [objects] and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry [them,] so that they may not touch the holy [objects] and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.
04Nm 4:16 "And the responsibility of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light and the fragrant incense and the continual grain offering and the anointing oil-- the responsibility of all the tabernacle and of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings."
04Nm 4:17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
04Nm 4:18 "Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites.
04Nm 4:19 "But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy [objects:] Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his work and to his load;
04Nm 4:20 but they shall not go in to see the holy [objects] even for a moment, lest they die. "
04Nm 4:21 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 4:22 "Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' households, by their families;
04Nm 4:23 from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter to perform the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:24 "This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying£º
04Nm 4:25 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting [with] its covering and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting,
04Nm 4:26 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform.
04Nm 4:27 "All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their loads and in all their work, shall be [performed] at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a duty all their loads.
04Nm 4:28 "This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their duties [shall be] under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 4:29 "[As for] the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers' households;
04Nm 4:30 from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:31 "Now this is the duty of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting£º the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets,
04Nm 4:32 and the pillars around the court and their sockets and their pegs and their cords, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign [each man] by name the items he is to carry.
04Nm 4:33 "This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
04Nm 4:34 So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers' households,
04Nm 4:35 from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:36 And their numbered men by their families were 27500.
04Nm 4:37 These are the numbered men of the Kohathite families, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
04Nm 4:38 And the numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their families, and by their fathers' households,
04Nm 4:39 from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:40 And their numbered men by their families, by their fathers' households, were 26300.
04Nm 4:41 These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD.
04Nm 4:42 And the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari by their families, by their fathers' households,
04Nm 4:43 from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:44 And their numbered men by their families were 32000.
04Nm 4:45 These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
04Nm 4:46 All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers' households,
04Nm 4:47 from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:48 And their numbered men were 85800.
04Nm 4:49 According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying; thus these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 5:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 5:2 "Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone having a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a [dead] person.
04Nm 5:3 "You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst."
04Nm 5:4 And the sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had spoken to Moses, thus the sons of Israel did.
04Nm 5:5 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 5:6 "Speak to the sons of Israel, 'When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind, acting unfaithfully against the LORD, and that person is guilty,
04Nm 5:7 then he shall confess his sins which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong, and add to it one-fifth of it, and give [it] to him whom he has wronged.
04Nm 5:8 'But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong [must go] to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which atonement is made for him.
04Nm 5:9 'Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy [gifts] of the sons of Israel, which they offer to the priest, shall be his.
04Nm 5:10 'So every man's holy [gifts] shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.' "
04Nm 5:11 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 5:12 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'If any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
04Nm 5:13 and a man has intercourse with her and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,
04Nm 5:14 if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself,
04Nm 5:15 the man shall then bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring [as] an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of iniquity.
04Nm 5:16 'Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before the LORD,
04Nm 5:17 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put [it] into the water.
04Nm 5:18 'The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD and let [the hair of] the woman's head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
04Nm 5:19 'And the priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, "If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness, [being] under [the authority of] your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse;
04Nm 5:20 if you, however, have gone astray, [being] under [the authority of] your husband, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you "
04Nm 5:21 (then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), "the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the Lord's making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell;
04Nm 5:22 and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away. "And the woman shall say," Amen. Amen."
04Nm 5:23 'The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness.
04Nm 5:24 'Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and [ cause] bitterness.
04Nm 5:25 'And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;
04Nm 5:26 and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer [it] up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.
04Nm 5:27 'When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings a curse shall go into her and [cause] bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
04Nm 5:28 'But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive children.
04Nm 5:29 'This is the law of jealousy£º when a wife, [being] under [the authority of] her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,
04Nm 5:30 or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply all this law to her.
04Nm 5:31 'Moreover, the man shall be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.' "
04Nm 6:1 Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 6:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself to the LORD,
04Nm 6:3 he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat fresh or dried grapes.
04Nm 6:4 'All the days of his separation he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine, from [the] seeds even to [the] skin.
04Nm 6:5 'All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to the LORD; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
04Nm 6:6 'All the days of his separation to the LORD he shall not go near to a dead person.
04Nm 6:7 'He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is on his head.
04Nm 6:8 'All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
04Nm 6:9 'But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his dedicated head [of hair,] then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day.
04Nm 6:10 'Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 6:11 'And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and [the] other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the [dead] person. And that same day he shall consecrate his head,
04Nm 6:12 and shall dedicate to the LORD his days as a Nazirite, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days shall be void because his separation was defiled.
04Nm 6:13 'Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 6:14 'And he shall present his offering to the LORD£º one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering and one ram without defect for a peace offering,
04Nm 6:15 and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their libations.
04Nm 6:16 'Then the priest shall present [them] before the LORD and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
04Nm 6:17 'He shall also offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its libation.
04Nm 6:18 'The Nazirite shall then shave his dedicated head [of hair] at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and take the dedicated hair of his head and put [it] on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
04Nm 6:19 'And the priest shall take the ram's shoulder [when it has been] boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put [them] on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated [hair].
04Nm 6:20 'Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by lifting up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.'
04Nm 6:21 "This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD according to his separation, in addition to what [else] he can afford; according to his vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his separation."
04Nm 6:22 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 6:23 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them£º
04Nm 6:24 The LORD bless you, and keep you;
04Nm 6:25 The LORD make His face shine on you, And be gracious to you;
04Nm 6:26 The LORD lift up His countenance on you, And give you peace. '
04Nm 6:27 "So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them."
04Nm 7:1 Now it came about on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also.
04Nm 7:2 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men).
04Nm 7:3 When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for [every] two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them before the tabernacle.
04Nm 7:4 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 7:5 "Accept [these things] from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, [to] each man according to his service."
04Nm 7:6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
04Nm 7:7 Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,
04Nm 7:8 and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 7:9 But he did not give [any] to the sons of Kohath because theirs [was] the service of the holy [objects, which] they carried on the shoulder.
04Nm 7:10 And the leaders offered the dedication [offering] for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
04Nm 7:11 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Let them present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar."
04Nm 7:12 Now the one who presented his offering on the first day [was] Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah;
04Nm 7:13 and his offering [was] one silver dish whose weight [was] one hundred and thirty [shekels,] one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;

04Nm 7:83 and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs one year old. This [was] the offering of Ahira the son of Enan.
04Nm 7:84 This [was] the dedication [offering] for the altar from the leaders of Israel when it was anointed£º twelve silver dishes, twelve silver bowls, twelve gold pans,
04Nm 7:85 each silver dish [weighing] one hundred and thirty [shekels] and each bowl seventy; all the silver of the utensils [was] 24000 [shekels,] according to the shekel of the sanctuary;
04Nm 7:86 the twelve gold pans, full of incense, [weighing] ten [shekels] apiece, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, all the gold of the pans 120 [shekels;]

04Nm 7:89 Now when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, so He spoke to him.
04Nm 8:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 8:2 "Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When you mount the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in the front of the lampstand.'"
04Nm 8:3 Aaron therefore did so; he mounted its lamps at the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:4 Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the LORD had showed Moses, so he made the lampstand.
04Nm 8:5 Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 8:6 "Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.
04Nm 8:7 "And thus you shall do to them, for their cleansing£º [sprinkle] purifying water on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body, and wash their clothes, and they shall be clean.
04Nm 8:8 "Then let them take a bull with its grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second bull you shall take for a sin offering.
04Nm 8:9 "So you shall present the Levites before the tent of meeting. You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel,
04Nm 8:10 and present the Levites before the LORD; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
04Nm 8:11 "Aaron then shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may qualify to perform the service of the LORD.
04Nm 8:12 "Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites.
04Nm 8:13 "And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to the LORD.
04Nm 8:14 "Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.
04Nm 8:15 "Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering;
04Nm 8:16 for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb, the first-born of all the sons of Israel.
04Nm 8:17 "For every first-born among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself.
04Nm 8:18 "But I have taken the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel.
04Nm 8:19 "And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting, and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, that there may be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary."
04Nm 8:20 Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.
04Nm 8:21 The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them.
04Nm 8:22 Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
04Nm 8:23 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 8:24 "This is what [applies] to the Levites£º from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 8:25 "But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from service in the work and not work any more.
04Nm 8:26 "They may, however, assist their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep an obligation; but they [themselves] shall do no work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations."
04Nm 9:1 Thus the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
04Nm 9:2 "Now, let the sons of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time.
04Nm 9:3 "On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall observe it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances."
04Nm 9:4 So Moses told the sons of Israel to observe the Passover.
04Nm 9:5 And they observed the Passover in the first [month,] on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did.
04Nm 9:6 But there were [some] men who were unclean because of [the] dead person, so that they could not observe Passover on that day; so they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
04Nm 9:7 And those men said to him, "[Though] we are unclean because of [the] dead person, why are we restrained from presenting the offering of the LORD at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?"
04Nm 9:8 Moses therefore said to them, "Wait, and I will listen to what the LORD will command concerning you."
04Nm 9:9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 9:10 "Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If any one of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a [dead] person, or is on a distant journey, he may, however, observe the Passover to the LORD.
04Nm 9:11 'In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
04Nm 9:12 'They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall observe it.
04Nm 9:13 'But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet neglects to observe the Passover, that person shall then be cut off from his people, for he did not present the offering of the LORD at its appointed time. That man shall bear his sin.
04Nm 9:14 'And if an alien sojourns among you and observes the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so he shall do; you shall have one statute, both for the alien and for the native of the land.' "
04Nm 9:15 Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle, until morning.
04Nm 9:16 So it was continuously; the cloud would cover it [by day,] and the appearance of fire by night.
04Nm 9:17 And whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would then set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp.
04Nm 9:18 At the command of the LORD the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of the LORD they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped.
04Nm 9:19 Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would keep the Lord's charge and not set out.
04Nm 9:20 If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, according to the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then according to the command of the LORD they set out.
04Nm 9:21 If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would move out; or [if it remained] in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out.
04Nm 9:22 Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out.
04Nm 9:23 At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out; they kept the Lord's charge, according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
04Nm 10:1 The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying,
04Nm 10:2 "Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out.
04Nm 10:3 "And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 10:4 "Yet if [only] one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall assemble before you.
04Nm 10:5 "But when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out.
04Nm 10:6 "And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out.
04Nm 10:7 "When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow without sounding an alarm.
04Nm 10:8 "The priestly sons of Aaron, moreover, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
04Nm 10:9 "And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and be saved from your enemies.
04Nm 10:10 "Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts, and on the first [days] of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 10:11 Now it came about in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony;
04Nm 10:12 and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 10:13 So they moved out for the first time according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.
04Nm 10:14 And the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army,
04Nm 10:15 and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar;
04Nm 10:16 and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.
04Nm 10:17 Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out.
04Nm 10:18 Next the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army,
04Nm 10:19 and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon,
04Nm 10:20 and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.
04Nm 10:21 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy [objects;] and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.
04Nm 10:22 Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, according to their armies, was set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army,
04Nm 10:23 and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh;
04Nm 10:24 and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.
04Nm 10:25 Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, [which formed] the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army,
04Nm 10:26 and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher;
04Nm 10:27 and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali.
04Nm 10:28 This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out.
04Nm 10:29 Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out to the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you'; come with us and we will do you good, for the LORD has promised good concerning Israel."
04Nm 10:30 But he said to him, "I will not come, but rather will go to my [own] land and relatives."
04Nm 10:31 Then he said, "Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us.
04Nm 10:32 "So it will be, if you go with us, it will come about that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do for you."
04Nm 10:33 Thus they set out from the mount of the LORD three days' journey, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD journeying in front of them for the three days, to seek out a resting place for them.
04Nm 10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, when they set out from the camp.
04Nm 10:35 Then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said, " Rise up, O LORD! And let Thine enemies be scattered, And let those who hate Thee flee before Thee."
04Nm 10:36 And when it came to rest, he said, "Return Thou, O LORD, [To] the myriad thousands of Israel."
04Nm 11:1 Now the people became like those who complain of adversity in the hearing of the LORD; and when the LORD heard [it,] His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed [some] of the outskirts of the camp.
04Nm 11:2 The people therefore cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died out.
04Nm 11:3 So the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.
04Nm 11:4 And the rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, "Who will give us meat to eat?
04Nm 11:5 "We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic,
04Nm 11:6 but now our appetite is gone. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna. "
04Nm 11:7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
04Nm 11:8 The people would go about and gather [it] and grind [it] between two millstones or beat [it] in the mortar, and boil [it] in the pot and make cakes with it; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil.
04Nm 11:9 And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
04Nm 11:10 Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.
04Nm 11:11 So Moses said to the LORD, "Why hast Thou been so hard on Thy servant? And why have I not found favor in Thy sight, that Thou hast laid the burden of all this people on me?
04Nm 11:12 "Was it I who conceived all this people? Was it I who brought them forth, that Thou shouldest say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which Thou didst swear to their fathers'?
04Nm 11:13 "Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, 'Give us meat that we may eat!'
04Nm 11:14 "I alone am not able to carry all this people, because it is too burdensome for me.
04Nm 11:15 "So if Thou art going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in Thy sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness."
04Nm 11:16 The LORD therefore said to Moses, "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
04Nm 11:17 "Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put [Him] upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you shall not bear [it] all alone.
04Nm 11:18 "And say to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying," Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For we were well-off in Egypt. "Therefore the LORD will give you meat and you shall eat.
04Nm 11:19 'You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,
04Nm 11:20 but a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?" '"
04Nm 11:21 But Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are 6000000 on foot; yet Thou hast said, 'I will give them meat in order that they may eat for a whole month.'
04Nm 11:22 "Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"
04Nm 11:23 And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the Lord's power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will come true for you or not."
04Nm 11:24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stationed them around the tent.
04Nm 11:25 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed [Him] upon the seventy elders. And it came about that when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do [it] again.
04Nm 11:26 But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp.
04Nm 11:27 So a young man ran and told Moses and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
04Nm 11:28 Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, "Moses, my lord, restrain them."
04Nm 11:29 But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!"
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses returned to the camp, [both] he and the elders of Israel.
04Nm 11:31 Now there went forth a wind from the LORD, and it brought quail from the sea, and let [them] fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits [deep] on the surface of the ground.
04Nm 11:32 And the people spent all day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers) and they spread [them] out for themselves all around the camp.
04Nm 11:33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague.
04Nm 11:34 So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy.
04Nm 11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.
04Nm 12:1 Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);
04Nm 12:2 and they said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" And the LORD heard it.
04Nm 12:3 (Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.)
04Nm 12:4 And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, "You three come out to the tent of meeting." So the three of them came out.
04Nm 12:5 Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come forward,
04Nm 12:6 He said, "Hear now My words£º If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, shall make Myself known to him in a vision. I shall speak with him in a dream.
04Nm 12:7 "Not so, with My servant Moses, He is faithful in all My household;
04Nm 12:8 With him I speak mouth to mouth, Even openly, and not in dark sayings, And he beholds the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid To speak against My servant, against Moses? "
04Nm 12:9 So the anger of the LORD burned against them and He departed.
04Nm 12:10 But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam [was] leprous, as [white as] snow. As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she [was] leprous.
04Nm 12:11 Then Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not account [ this] sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned.
04Nm 12:12 "Oh, do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother's womb!"
04Nm 12:13 And Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, "O God, heal her, I pray!"
04Nm 12:14 But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be received again."
04Nm 12:15 So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was received again.
04Nm 12:16 Afterward, however, the people moved out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 13:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses saying,
04Nm 13:2 "Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers' tribes, every one a leader among them."
04Nm 13:3 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel.
04Nm 13:4 These then [were] their names£º from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
04Nm 13:5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
04Nm 13:6 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
04Nm 13:7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
04Nm 13:8 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
04Nm 13:9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
04Nm 13:10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
04Nm 13:11 from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
04Nm 13:12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
04Nm 13:13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
04Nm 13:14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
04Nm 13:15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
04Nm 13:16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.
04Nm 13:17 When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, "Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country.
04Nm 13:18 "And see what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong [or] weak, whether they are few or many.
04Nm 13:19 "And how is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are [they] like [open] camps or with fortifications?
04Nm 13:20 "And how is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land." Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
04Nm 13:21 So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath.
04Nm 13:22 When they had gone up into the Negev, they came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
04Nm 13:23 Then they came to the valley of Eshcol and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two [men,] with some of the pomegranates and the figs.
04Nm 13:24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
04Nm 13:25 When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days,
04Nm 13:26 they proceeded to come to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
04Nm 13:27 Thus they told him, and said, "We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
04Nm 13:28 "Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified [and] very large; and moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
04Nm 13:29 "Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan."
04Nm 13:30 Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, "We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we shall surely overcome it."
04Nm 13:31 But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us."
04Nm 13:32 So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, "The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of [great] size.
04Nm 13:33 "There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight."
04Nm 14:1 Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night.
04Nm 14:2 And all the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!
04Nm 14:3 "And why is the LORD bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?"
04Nm 14:4 So they said to one another, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt."
04Nm 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
04Nm 14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes;
04Nm 14:7 and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.
04Nm 14:8 "If the LORD is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it to us-- a land which flows with milk and honey.
04Nm 14:9 "Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they shall be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us; do not fear them."
04Nm 14:10 But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.
04Nm 14:11 And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst?
04Nm 14:12 "I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they."
04Nm 14:13 But Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Thy strength Thou didst bring up this people from their midst,
04Nm 14:14 and they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that Thou, O LORD, art in the midst of this people, for Thou, O LORD, art seen eye to eye, while Thy cloud stands over them; and Thou dost go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
04Nm 14:15 "Now if Thou dost slay this people as one man, then the nations who have heard of Thy fame will say,
04Nm 14:16 'Because the LORD could not bring this people into the land which He promised them by oath, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.'
04Nm 14:17 "But now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as Thou hast declared,
04Nm 14:18 'The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear [the guilty,] visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth [generations.]'
04Nm 14:19 "Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Thy lovingkindness, just as Thou also hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."
04Nm 14:20 So the LORD said, "I have pardoned [them] according to your word;
04Nm 14:21 but indeed, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD.
04Nm 14:22 "Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs, which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice,
04Nm 14:23 shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it.
04Nm 14:24 "But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it.
04Nm 14:25 "Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
04Nm 14:26 And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
04Nm 14:27 "How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are making against Me.
04Nm 14:28 "Say to them, 'As I live,' says the LORD, 'just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will surely do to you;
04Nm 14:29 your corpses shall fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me.
04Nm 14:30 'Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
04Nm 14:31 'Your children, however, whom you said would become a prey-- I will bring them in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.
04Nm 14:32 'But as for you, your corpses shall fall in this wilderness.
04Nm 14:33 'And your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness, and they shall suffer [for] your unfaithfulness, until your corpses lie in the wilderness.
04Nm 14:34 'According to the number of days which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day you shall bear your guilt a year, [even] forty years, and you shall know My opposition.
04Nm 14:35 'I, the LORD, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be destroyed, and there they shall die.' "
04Nm 14:36 As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land,
04Nm 14:37 even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD.
04Nm 14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
04Nm 14:39 And when Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people mourned greatly.
04Nm 14:40 In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, "Here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised."
04Nm 14:41 But Moses said, "Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD, when it will not succeed?
04Nm 14:42 "Do not go up, lest you be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you.
04Nm 14:43 "For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, inasmuch as you have turned back from following the LORD. And the LORD will not be with you."
04Nm 14:44 But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country; neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses left the camp.
04Nm 14:45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah.
04Nm 15:1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 15:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you enter the land where you are to live, which I am giving you,
04Nm 15:3 then make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock.
04Nm 15:4 'And the one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of one-tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil,
04Nm 15:5 and you shall prepare wine for the libation, one-fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
04Nm 15:6 'Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
04Nm 15:7 and for the libation you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:8 'And when you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to the LORD,
04Nm 15:9 then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with one-half a hin of oil;
04Nm 15:10 and you shall offer as the libation one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:11 'Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats.
04Nm 15:12 'According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for everyone according to their number.
04Nm 15:13 'All who are native shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:14 'And if an alien sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he [wishes to] make an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do, so he shall do.
04Nm 15:15 '[As for] the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the alien who sojourns [with you,] a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the alien be before the LORD.
04Nm 15:16 'There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the alien who sojourns with you.' "
04Nm 15:17 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 15:18 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you enter the land where I bring you,
04Nm 15:19 then it shall be, that when you eat of the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD.
04Nm 15:20 'Of the first of your dough you shall lift up a cake as an offering; as the offering of the threshing floor, so you shall lift it up.
04Nm 15:21 'From the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an offering throughout your generations.
04Nm 15:22 'But when you unwittingly fail and do not observe all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,
04Nm 15:23 [even] all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day when the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,
04Nm 15:24 then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull for a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering, and its libation, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:25 'Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error.
04Nm 15:26 'So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be forgiven, with the alien who sojourns among them, for [it happened] to all the people through error.
04Nm 15:27 'Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a one year old female goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:28 'And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be forgiven.
04Nm 15:29 'You shall have one law for him who does [anything] unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the alien who sojourns among them.
04Nm 15:30 'But the person who does [anything] defiantly, whether he is native or an alien, that one is blaspheming the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
04Nm 15:31 'Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt [shall be] on him.' "
04Nm 15:32 Now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day.
04Nm 15:33 And those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation;
04Nm 15:34 and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
04Nm 15:35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp."
04Nm 15:36 So all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 15:37 The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 15:38 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue.
04Nm 15:39 "And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot,
04Nm 15:40 in order that you may remember to do all My commandments, and be holy to your God.
04Nm 15:41 "I am the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 16:1 Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [action,]
04Nm 16:2 and they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen in the assembly, men of renown.
04Nm 16:3 And they assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard [this,] he fell on his face;
04Nm 16:5 and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His, and who is holy, and will bring [him] near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself.
04Nm 16:6 "Do this£º take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company,
04Nm 16:7 and put fire in them, and lay incense upon them in the presence of the LORD tomorrow; and the man whom the LORD chooses [shall be] the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi! "
04Nm 16:8 Then Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi,
04Nm 16:9 is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the [rest of] the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;
04Nm 16:10 and that He has brought you near, [Korah,] and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking for the priesthood also?
04Nm 16:11 "Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD; but as for Aaron, who is he that you grumble against him?"
04Nm 16:12 Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, "We will not come up.
04Nm 16:13 "Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us?
04Nm 16:14 "Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!"
04Nm 16:15 Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not regard their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them."
04Nm 16:16 And Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company be present before the LORD tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron.
04Nm 16:17 "And each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty firepans; also you and Aaron [shall] each [bring] his firepan."
04Nm 16:18 So they each took his [own] censer and put fire on it, and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 16:19 Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
04Nm 16:20 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
04Nm 16:21 "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly."
04Nm 16:22 But they fell on their faces, and said, "O God, Thou God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, wilt Thou be angry with the entire congregation?"
04Nm 16:23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 16:24 "Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"
04Nm 16:25 Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him,
04Nm 16:26 and he spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, lest you be swept away in all their sin."
04Nm 16:27 So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out [and] stood at the doorway of their tents, along with their wives and their sons and their little ones.
04Nm 16:28 And Moses said, "By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these deeds; for this is not my doing.
04Nm 16:29 "If these men die the death of all men, or if they suffer the fate of all men, [then] the LORD has not sent me.
04Nm 16:30 "But if the LORD brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned the LORD."
04Nm 16:31 Then it came about as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them split open;
04Nm 16:32 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah, with [their] possessions.
04Nm 16:33 So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
04Nm 16:34 And all Israel who [were] around them fled at their outcry, for they said, "The earth may swallow us up!"
04Nm 16:35 Fire also came forth from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.
04Nm 16:36 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 16:37 "Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze, for they are holy; and you scatter the burning coals abroad.
04Nm 16:38 "As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar, since they did present them before the LORD and they are holy; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel."
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had offered; and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar,
04Nm 16:40 as a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron should come near to burn incense before the LORD; that he might not become like Korah and his company-- just as the LORD had spoken to him through Moses.
04Nm 16:41 But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You are the ones who have caused the death of the Lord's people."
04Nm 16:42 It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
04Nm 16:43 Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
04Nm 16:44 and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 16:45 "Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly." Then they fell on their faces.
04Nm 16:46 And Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar, and lay incense [on it;] then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from the LORD, the plague has begun!"
04Nm 16:47 Then Aaron took [it] as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put [on] the incense and made atonement for the people.
04Nm 16:48 And he took his stand between the dead and the living, so that the plague was checked.
04Nm 16:49 But those who died by the plague were 147000, besides those who died on account of Korah.
04Nm 16:50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked.
04Nm 17:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 17:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father's household£º twelve rods, from all their leaders according to their fathers' households. You shall write each name on his rod,
04Nm 17:3 and write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head [of each] of their fathers' households.
04Nm 17:4 "You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you.
04Nm 17:5 "And it will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I shall lessen from upon Myself the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you."
04Nm 17:6 Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers' households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.
04Nm 17:7 So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
04Nm 17:8 Now it came about on the next day that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.
04Nm 17:9 Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the LORD to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod.
04Nm 17:10 But the LORD said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they should not die."
04Nm 17:11 Thus Moses did; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did.
04Nm 17:12 Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish, we are dying, we are all dying!
04Nm 17:13 "Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?"
04Nm 18:1 So the LORD said to Aaron, "You and your sons and your father's household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood.
04Nm 18:2 "But bring with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you, while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.
04Nm 18:3 "And they shall thus attend to your obligation and the obligation of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, lest both they and you die.
04Nm 18:4 "And they shall be joined with you and attend to the obligations of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you.
04Nm 18:5 "So you shall attend to the obligations of the sanctuary and the obligations of the altar, that there may no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel.
04Nm 18:6 "And behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD, to perform the service for the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:7 "But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and inside the veil, and you are to perform service. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death."
04Nm 18:8 Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, "Now behold, I Myself have given you charge of My offerings, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, I have given them to you as a portion, and to your sons as a perpetual allotment.
04Nm 18:9 "This shall be yours from the most holy [gifts, reserved] from the fire; every offering of theirs, even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
04Nm 18:10 "As the most holy [gifts] you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
04Nm 18:11 "This also is yours, the offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it.
04Nm 18:12 "All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the LORD, I give them to you.
04Nm 18:13 "The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it.
04Nm 18:14 "Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
04Nm 18:15 "Every first issue of the womb of all flesh, whether man or animal, which they offer to the LORD, shall be yours; nevertheless the first-born of man you shall surely redeem, and the first-born of unclean animals you shall redeem.
04Nm 18:16 "And as to their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem them, by your valuation, five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
04Nm 18:17 "But the first-born of an ox or the first-born of a sheep or the first-born of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke [as] an offering by fire, for a soothing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 18:18 "And their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh.
04Nm 18:19 "All the offerings of the holy [gifts,] which the sons of Israel offer to the LORD, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD to you and your descendants with you."
04Nm 18:20 Then the LORD said to Aaron, "You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.
04Nm 18:21 "And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:22 "And the sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, lest they bear sin and die.
04Nm 18:23 "Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
04Nm 18:24 "For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning them, 'They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.'"
04Nm 18:25 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 18:26 "Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe.
04Nm 18:27 'And your offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat.
04Nm 18:28 'So you shall also present an offering to the LORD from your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the Lord's offering to Aaron the priest.
04Nm 18:29 'Out of all your gifts you shall present every offering due to the LORD, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.'
04Nm 18:30 "And you shall say to them, 'When you have offered from it the best of it, then [the rest] shall be reckoned to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor, and as the product of the wine vat.
04Nm 18:31 'And you may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
04Nm 18:32 'And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have offered the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, lest you die.' "
04Nm 19:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
04Nm 19:2 "This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded, saying, 'Speak to the sons of Israel that they bring you an unblemished red heifer in which is no defect, [and] on which a yoke has never been placed.
04Nm 19:3 'And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence.
04Nm 19:4 'Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
04Nm 19:5 'Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned.
04Nm 19:6 'And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet [material,] and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer.
04Nm 19:7 'The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward come into the camp, but the priest shall be unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:8 'The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:9 'Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin.
04Nm 19:10 'And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the alien who sojourns among them.
04Nm 19:11 'The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:12 'That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, [and then] he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
04Nm 19:13 'Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.
04Nm 19:14 'This is the law when a man dies in a tent£º everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:15 'And every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, shall be unclean.
04Nm 19:16 'Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died [naturally,] or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:17 'Then for the unclean [person] they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel.
04Nm 19:18 'And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip [it] in the water, and sprinkle [it] on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying [naturally] or the grave.
04Nm 19:19 'Then the clean [person] shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe [himself] in water and shall be clean by evening.
04Nm 19:20 'But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean.
04Nm 19:21 'So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:22 'Furthermore, anything that the unclean [person] touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches [it] shall be unclean until evening.' "
04Nm 20:1 Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there.
04Nm 20:2 And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 20:3 The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, "If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!
04Nm 20:4 "Why then have you brought the Lord's assembly into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here?
04Nm 20:5 "And why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink."
04Nm 20:6 Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to them;
04Nm 20:7 and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 20:8 "Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink."
04Nm 20:9 So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him;
04Nm 20:10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, "Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?"
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank.
04Nm 20:12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."
04Nm 20:13 Those [were] the waters of Meribah, because the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them.
04Nm 20:14 From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom£º "Thus your brother Israel has said, 'You know all the hardship that has befallen us;
04Nm 20:15 that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly.
04Nm 20:16 'But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
04Nm 20:17 'Please let us pass through your land. We shall not pass through field or through vineyard; we shall not even drink water from a well. We shall go along the king's highway, not turning to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.' "
04Nm 20:18 Edom, however, said to him, "You shall not pass through us, lest I come out with the sword against you."
04Nm 20:19 Again, the sons of Israel said to him, "We shall go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing [else.]"
04Nm 20:20 But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out against him with a heavy force, and with a strong hand.
04Nm 20:21 Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
04Nm 20:22 Now when they set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:23 Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
04Nm 20:24 "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
04Nm 20:25 "Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
04Nm 20:26 and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered [to his people,] and will die there. "
04Nm 20:27 So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
04Nm 20:28 And after Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
04Nm 20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
04Nm 21:1 When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, then he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
04Nm 21:2 So Israel made a vow to the LORD, and said, "If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
04Nm 21:3 And the LORD heard the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah.
04Nm 21:4 Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient because of the journey.
04Nm 21:5 And the people spoke against God and Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food."
04Nm 21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.
04Nm 21:7 So the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against the LORD and you; intercede with the LORD, that He may remove the serpents from us." And Moses interceded for the people.
04Nm 21:8 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Make a fiery [serpent,] and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he shall live."
04Nm 21:9 And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.
04Nm 21:10 Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped in Oboth.
04Nm 21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and camped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, to the east.
04Nm 21:12 From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered.
04Nm 21:13 From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
04Nm 21:14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, " Waheb in Suphah, And the wadis of the Arnon,
04Nm 21:15 And the slope of the wadis That extends to the site of Ar, And leans to the border of Moab. "
04Nm 21:16 And from there [they continued] to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Assemble the people, that I may give them water."
04Nm 21:17 Then Israel sang this song£º "Spring up, O well! Sing to it!
04Nm 21:18 "The well, which the leaders sank, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter [and] with their staffs." And from the wilderness [they continued] to Mattanah,
04Nm 21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
04Nm 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland.
04Nm 21:21 Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,
04Nm 21:22 "Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king's highway until we have passed through your border."
04Nm 21:23 But Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
04Nm 21:24 Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon [was] Jazer.
04Nm 21:25 And Israel took all these cities and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her villages.
04Nm 21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.
04Nm 21:27 Therefore those who use proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! So let the city of Sihon be established.
04Nm 21:28 "For a fire went forth from Heshbon, A flame from the town of Sihon; It devoured Ar of Moab, The dominant heights of the Arnon.
04Nm 21:29 "Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To an Amorite king, Sihon.
04Nm 21:30 "But we have cast them down, Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, Then we have laid waste even to Nophah, Which [reaches] to Medeba."
04Nm 21:31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
04Nm 21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who [were] there.
04Nm 21:33 Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out with all his people, for battle at Edrei.
04Nm 21:34 But the LORD said to Moses, "Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
04Nm 21:35 So they killed him and his sons and all his people, until there was no remnant left him; and they possessed his land.
04Nm 22:1 Then the sons of Israel journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan [opposite] Jericho.
04Nm 22:2 Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
04Nm 22:3 So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel.
04Nm 22:4 And Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
04Nm 22:5 So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the River, [in] the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me.
04Nm 22:6 "Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
04Nm 22:7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the [ fees for] divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam and repeated Balak's words to him.
04Nm 22:8 And he said to them, "Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you as the LORD may speak to me." And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.
04Nm 22:9 Then God came to Balaam and said, "Who are these men with you?"
04Nm 22:10 And Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent [word] to me,
04Nm 22:11 'Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I may be able to fight against them, and drive them out.' "
04Nm 22:12 And God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
04Nm 22:13 So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak's leaders, "Go back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
04Nm 22:14 And the leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."
04Nm 22:15 Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more distinguished than the former.
04Nm 22:16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Let nothing, I beg you, hinder you from coming to me;
04Nm 22:17 for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then, curse this people for me. '"
04Nm 22:18 And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, "Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God.
04Nm 22:19 "And now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will speak to me."
04Nm 22:20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up [and] go with them; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do."
04Nm 22:21 So Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab.
04Nm 22:22 But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him.
04Nm 22:23 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way.
04Nm 22:24 Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, [with] a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
04Nm 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed herself to the wall and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall, so he struck her again.
04Nm 22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left.
04Nm 22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick.
04Nm 22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"
04Nm 22:29 Then Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now."
04Nm 22:30 And the donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?" And he said, "No."
04Nm 22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground.
04Nm 22:32 And the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was contrary to me.
04Nm 22:33 "But the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you just now, and let her live."
04Nm 22:34 And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back."
04Nm 22:35 But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word which I shall tell you." So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak.
04Nm 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the extreme end of the border.
04Nm 22:37 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor you?"
04Nm 22:38 So Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak."
04Nm 22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
04Nm 22:40 And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent [some] to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.
04Nm 22:41 Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to the high places of Baal; and he saw from there a portion of the people.
04Nm 23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here."
04Nm 23:2 And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a bare hill.
04Nm 23:4 Now God met Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."
04Nm 23:5 Then the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, "Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus."
04Nm 23:6 So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.
04Nm 23:7 And he took up his discourse and said, "From Aram Balak has brought me, Moab's king from the mountains of the East, 'Come curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!'
04Nm 23:8 "How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how can I denounce, whom the LORD has not denounced?
04Nm 23:9 "As I see him from the top of the rocks, And I look at him from the hills; Behold, a people [who] dwells apart, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
04Nm 23:10 "Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my end be like his!"
04Nm 23:11 Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed them!"
04Nm 23:12 And he answered and said, "Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
04Nm 23:13 Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, although you will only see the extreme end of them, and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there."
04Nm 23:14 So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on [each] altar.
04Nm 23:15 And he said to Balak, "Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I myself meet [the] [LORD] yonder."
04Nm 23:16 Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, " Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak. "
04Nm 23:17 And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the LORD spoken?"
04Nm 23:18 Then he took up his discourse and said, "Arise, O Balak, and hear; Give ear to me, O son of Zippor!
04Nm 23:19 "God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?
04Nm 23:20 "Behold, I have received [a command] to bless; When He has blessed, then I cannot revoke it.
04Nm 23:21 "He has not observed misfortune in Jacob; Nor has He seen trouble in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.
04Nm 23:22 "God brings them out of Egypt, He is for them like the horns of the wild ox.
04Nm 23:23 "For there is no omen against Jacob, Nor is there any divination against Israel; At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to Israel, what God has done.
04Nm 23:24 "Behold, a people rises like a lioness, And as a lion it lifts itself; It shall not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain."
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!"
04Nm 23:26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Did I not tell you, 'Whatever the LORD speaks, that I must do'?"
04Nm 23:27 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them for me from there."
04Nm 23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland.
04Nm 23:29 And Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here."
04Nm 23:30 And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.
04Nm 24:1 When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens but he set his face toward the wilderness.
04Nm 24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
04Nm 24:3 And he took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened;
04Nm 24:4 The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,
04Nm 24:5 How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel!
04Nm 24:6 "Like valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters.
04Nm 24:7 "Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed [shall be] by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.
04Nm 24:8 "God brings him out of Egypt, He is for him like the horns of the wild ox. He shall devour the nations [who are] his adversaries, And shall crush their bones in pieces, And shatter [them] with his arrows.
04Nm 24:9 "He couches, he lies down as a lion, And as a lion, who dares rouse him? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, And cursed is everyone who curses you."
04Nm 24:10 Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!
04Nm 24:11 "Therefore, flee to your place now. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor."
04Nm 24:12 And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying,
04Nm 24:13 'Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything contrary to the command of the LORD, either good or bad, of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak'?
04Nm 24:14 "And now behold, I am going to my people; come, [and] I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the days to come."
04Nm 24:15 And he took up his discourse and said, "The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, And the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
04Nm 24:16 The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered.
04Nm 24:17 "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A star shall come forth from Jacob, And a scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth.
04Nm 24:18 "And Edom shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also shall be a possession, While Israel performs valiantly.
04Nm 24:19 "One from Jacob shall have dominion, And shall destroy the remnant from the city."
04Nm 24:20 And he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, " Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end [shall be] destruction."
04Nm 24:21 And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, "Your dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff.
04Nm 24:22 "Nevertheless Kain shall be consumed; How long shall Asshur keep you captive?"
04Nm 24:23 And he took up his discourse and said, "Alas, who can live except God has ordained it?
04Nm 24:24 "But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, And they shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber; So they also [shall come] to destruction."
04Nm 24:25 Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way.
04Nm 25:1 While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab.
04Nm 25:2 For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
04Nm 25:3 So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry against Israel.
04Nm 25:4 And the LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel."
04Nm 25:5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Each of you slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor."
04Nm 25:6 Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 25:7 When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he arose from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;
04Nm 25:8 and he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. So the plague on the sons of Israel was checked.
04Nm 25:9 And those who died by the plague were 240000.
04Nm 25:10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 25:11 "Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel, in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy.
04Nm 25:12 "Therefore say, 'Behold, I give him My covenant of peace;
04Nm 25:13 and it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the sons of Israel. '"
04Nm 25:14 Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father's household among the Simeonites.
04Nm 25:15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head of the people of a father's household in Midian.
04Nm 25:16 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 25:17 "Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them;
04Nm 25:18 for they have been hostile to you with their tricks, with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor, and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor. "
04Nm 26:1 Then it came about after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
04Nm 26:2 "Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' households, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel."
04Nm 26:3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
04Nm 26:4 "[Take a census of the people] from twenty years old and upward, as the LORD has commanded Moses." Now the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt [were:]

04Nm 26:54 "To the larger [group] you shall increase their inheritance, and to the smaller [group] you shall diminish their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them.
04Nm 26:55 "But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
04Nm 26:56 "According to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller [groups.]"

04Nm 26:60 And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04Nm 26:61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the LORD.
04Nm 26:62 And those who were numbered of them were 230000, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel.
04Nm 26:63 These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
04Nm 26:64 But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 26:65 For the LORD had said of them, "They shall surely die in the wilderness." And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
04Nm 27:1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these are the names of his daughters£º Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah.
04Nm 27:2 And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, saying,
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.
04Nm 27:4 "Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father's brothers."
04Nm 27:5 And Moses brought their case before the LORD.
04Nm 27:6 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 27:7 "The daughters of Zelophehad are right in [their] statements. You shall surely give them a hereditary possession among their father's brothers, and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
04Nm 27:8 "Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
04Nm 27:9 'And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
04Nm 27:10 'And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
04Nm 27:11 'And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be a statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses.' "
04Nm 27:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel.
04Nm 27:13 "And when you have seen it, you too shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was;
04Nm 27:14 for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water. "(These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
04Nm 27:15 Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
04Nm 27:16 "May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
04Nm 27:17 who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be like sheep which have no shepherd. "
04Nm 27:18 So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;
04Nm 27:19 and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight.
04Nm 27:20 "And you shall put some of your authority on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey [him.]
04Nm 27:21 "Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his command they shall go out and at his command they shall come in, [both] he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation."
04Nm 27:22 And Moses did just as the LORD commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation.
04Nm 27:23 Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
04Nm 28:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 28:2 "Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be careful to present My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.'
04Nm 28:3 "And you shall say to them, 'This is the offering by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two male lambs one year old without defect [as] a continual burnt offering every day.
04Nm 28:4 'You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;
04Nm 28:5 also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil.
04Nm 28:6 'It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.
04Nm 28:7 'Then the libation with it [shall be] a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a libation of strong drink to the LORD.
04Nm 28:8 'And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its libation, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to the LORD.

04Nm 30:6 "However, if she should marry while under her vows or the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,
04Nm 30:7 and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day he hears [it,] then her vows shall stand and her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand.
04Nm 30:8 "But if on the day her husband hears [of it,] he forbids her, then he shall annul her vow which she is under and the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her.
04Nm 30:9 "But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.
04Nm 30:10 "However, if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound herself by an obligation with an oath,
04Nm 30:11 and her husband heard [it,] but said nothing to her [and] did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand, and every obligation by which she bound herself shall stand.
04Nm 30:12 "But if her husband indeed annuls them on the day he hears [them,] then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the obligation of herself, shall not stand; her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will forgive her.
04Nm 30:13 "Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it.
04Nm 30:14 "But if her husband indeed says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her obligations which are on her; he has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them.
04Nm 30:15 "But if he indeed annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt."
04Nm 30:16 These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, [as] between a man and his wife, [and as] between a father and his daughter, [while she is] in her youth in her father's house.
04Nm 31:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 31:2 "Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people."
04Nm 31:3 And Moses spoke to the people, saying, "Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the Lord's vengeance on Midian.
04Nm 31:4 "A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war."
04Nm 31:5 So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
04Nm 31:6 And Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war with them, and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
04Nm 31:7 So they made war against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
04Nm 31:8 And they killed the kings of Midian along with the [rest of] their slain£º Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
04Nm 31:9 And the sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods, they plundered.
04Nm 31:10 Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire.
04Nm 31:11 And they took all the spoil and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
04Nm 31:12 And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
04Nm 31:13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
04Nm 31:14 And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
04Nm 31:15 And Moses said to them, "Have you spared all the women?
04Nm 31:16 "Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, so the plague was among the congregation of the LORD.
04Nm 31:17 "Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately.
04Nm 31:18 "But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves.
04Nm 31:19 "And you, camp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves, you and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day.
04Nm 31:20 "And you shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats' [hair,] and all articles of wood."
04Nm 31:21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, "This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses£º
04Nm 31:22 only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin and the lead,
04Nm 31:23 everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean, but it shall be purified with water for impurity. But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water.
04Nm 31:24 "And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may enter the camp."
04Nm 31:25 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 31:26 "You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' [households] of the congregation, take a count of the booty that was captured, both of man and of animal;
04Nm 31:27 and divide the booty between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
04Nm 31:28 "And levy a tax for the LORD from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep;
04Nm 31:29 take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as an offering to the LORD.
04Nm 31:30 "And from the sons of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD."
04Nm 31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:32 Now the booty that remained from the spoil which the men of war had plundered was 6750000 sheep,
04Nm 31:33 and 720000 cattle,
04Nm 31:34 and 610000 donkeys,
04Nm 31:35 and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were 320000.
04Nm 31:36 And the half, the portion of those who went out to war, was [as follows:] the number of sheep was 3375000,
04Nm 31:37 and the Lord's levy of the sheep was 675,
04Nm 31:38 and the cattle were 360000, from which the Lord's levy was 72.
04Nm 31:39 And the donkeys were 305000, from which the Lord's levy was 61.
04Nm 31:40 And the human beings were 160000, from whom the Lord's levy was 32 persons.
04Nm 31:41 And Moses gave the levy [which was] the Lord's offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:42 As for the sons of Israel's half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war--
04Nm 31:43 now the congregation's half was 3375000 sheep,
04Nm 31:44 and 360000 cattle,
04Nm 31:45 and 305000 donkeys,
04Nm 31:46 and the human beings were 160000--
04Nm 31:47 and from the sons of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:48 Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses;
04Nm 31:49 and they said to Moses, "Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing.
04Nm 31:50 "So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
04Nm 31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles.
04Nm 31:52 And all the gold of the offering which they offered up to the LORD, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, was 167500 shekels.
04Nm 31:53 The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.
04Nm 31:54 So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD.
04Nm 32:1 Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock. So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock,
04Nm 32:2 the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
04Nm 32:3 "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon,
04Nm 32:4 the land which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock. "
04Nm 32:5 And they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan."
04Nm 32:6 But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here?
04Nm 32:7 "Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them?
04Nm 32:8 "This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
04Nm 32:9 "For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
04Nm 32:10 "So the Lord's anger burned in that day, and He swore, saying,
04Nm 32:11 'None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob; for they did not follow Me fully,
04Nm 32:12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed the LORD fully. '
04Nm 32:13 "So the Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed.
04Nm 32:14 "Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the LORD against Israel.
04Nm 32:15 "For if you turn away from following Him, He will once more abandon them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people."
04Nm 32:16 Then they came near to him and said, "We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones;
04Nm 32:17 but we ourselves will be armed ready [to go] before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
04Nm 32:18 "We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance.
04Nm 32:19 "For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan toward the east."
04Nm 32:20 So Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for the war,
04Nm 32:21 and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies out from before Him,
04Nm 32:22 and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward the LORD and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours for a possession before the LORD.
04Nm 32:23 "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.
04Nm 32:24 "Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and sheepfolds for your sheep; and do what you have promised."
04Nm 32:25 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, " Your servants will do just as my lord commands.
04Nm 32:26 "Our little ones, our wives, our livestock and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead;
04Nm 32:27 while your servants, everyone who is armed for war, will cross over in the presence of the LORD to battle, just as my lord says. "
04Nm 32:28 So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' [households] of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
04Nm 32:29 And Moses said to them, "If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the LORD, and the land will be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
04Nm 32:30 but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. "
04Nm 32:31 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, "As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do.
04Nm 32:32 "We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [shall remain] with us across the Jordan."
04Nm 32:33 So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with [their] territories, the cities of the surrounding land.
04Nm 32:34 And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,
04Nm 32:35 and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,
04Nm 32:36 and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and sheepfolds for sheep.
04Nm 32:37 And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
04Nm 32:38 and Nebo and Baal-meon-- [their] names being changed-- and Sibmah, and they gave [other] names to the cities which they built.
04Nm 32:39 And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
04Nm 32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.
04Nm 32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair.
04Nm 32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name.
04Nm 33:1 These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out from the land of Egypt by their armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 33:2 And Moses recorded their starting places according to their journeys by the command of the LORD, and these are their journeys according to their starting places.
04Nm 33:3 And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians,
04Nm 33:4 while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born whom the LORD had struck down among them. The LORD had also executed judgments on their gods.
04Nm 33:5 Then the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and camped in Succoth.
04Nm 33:6 And they journeyed from Succoth, and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness.
04Nm 33:7 And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon; and they camped before Migdol.
04Nm 33:8 And they journeyed from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and camped at Marah.
04Nm 33:9 And they journeyed from Marah, and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they camped there.
04Nm 33:10 And they journeyed from Elim, and camped by the Red Sea.
04Nm 33:11 And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
04Nm 33:12 And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and camped at Dophkah.
04Nm 33:13 And they journeyed from Dophkah, and camped at Alush.
04Nm 33:14 And they journeyed from Alush, and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink.
04Nm 33:15 And they journeyed from Rephidim, and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 33:16 And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
04Nm 33:17 And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and camped at Hazeroth.
04Nm 33:18 And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and camped at Rithmah.
04Nm 33:19 And they journeyed from Rithmah, and camped at Rimmon-perez.
04Nm 33:20 And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and camped at Libnah.
04Nm 33:21 And they journeyed from Libnah, and camped at Rissah.
04Nm 33:22 And they journeyed from Rissah, and camped in Kehelathah.
04Nm 33:23 And they journeyed from Kehelathah, and camped at Mount Shepher.
04Nm 33:24 And they journeyed from Mount Shepher, and camped at Haradah.
04Nm 33:25 And they journeyed from Haradah, and camped at Makheloth.
04Nm 33:26 And they journeyed from Makheloth, and camped at Tahath.
04Nm 33:27 And they journeyed from Tahath, and camped at Terah.
04Nm 33:28 And they journeyed from Terah, and camped at Mithkah.
04Nm 33:29 And they journeyed from Mithkah, and camped at Hashmonah.
04Nm 33:30 And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and camped at Moseroth.
04Nm 33:31 And they journeyed from Moseroth, and camped at Bene-jaakan.
04Nm 33:32 And they journeyed from Bene-jaakan, and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
04Nm 33:33 And they journeyed from Hor-haggidgad, and camped at Jotbathah.
04Nm 33:34 And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and camped at Abronah.
04Nm 33:35 And they journeyed from Abronah, and camped at Ezion-geber.
04Nm 33:36 And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh.
04Nm 33:37 And they journeyed from Kadesh, and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom.
04Nm 33:38 Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come from the land of Egypt on the first [day] in the fifth month.
04Nm 33:39 And Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
04Nm 33:40 Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the sons of Israel.
04Nm 33:41 Then they journeyed from Mount Hor, and camped at Zalmonah.
04Nm 33:42 And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and camped at Punon.
04Nm 33:43 And they journeyed from Punon, and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 33:44 And they journeyed from Oboth, and camped at Iye-abarim, at the border of Moab.
04Nm 33:45 And they journeyed from Iyim, and camped at Dibon-gad.
04Nm 33:46 And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
04Nm 33:47 And they journeyed from Almon-diblathaim, and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
04Nm 33:48 And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [opposite] Jericho.
04Nm 33:49 And they camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
04Nm 33:50 Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [opposite] Jericho, saying,
04Nm 33:51 "Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 33:52 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places;
04Nm 33:53 and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it.
04Nm 33:54 'And you shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give more inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give less inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
04Nm 33:55 'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come about that those whom you let remain of them [ will become] as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land in which you live.
04Nm 33:56 'And it shall come about that as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.' "
04Nm 34:1 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 34:2 "Command the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, [ even the] land of Canaan according to its borders.
04Nm 34:3 'Your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.
04Nm 34:4 'Then your border shall turn [direction] from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and continue to Zin, and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall reach Hazaraddar, and continue to Azmon.
04Nm 34:5 'And the border shall turn [direction] from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the sea.
04Nm 34:6 'As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, [its] coastline; this shall be your west border.
04Nm 34:7 'And this shall be your north border£º you shall draw your [border] line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor.
04Nm 34:8 'You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to the Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad;
04Nm 34:9 and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.
04Nm 34:10 'For your eastern border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham,
04Nm 34:11 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth.
04Nm 34:12 'And the border shall go down to the Jordan and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.' "
04Nm 34:13 So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the land that you are to apportion by lot among you as a possession, which the LORD has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes.
04Nm 34:14 "For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received [theirs] according to their fathers' households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers' households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession.
04Nm 34:15 "The two and a half tribes have received their possession across the Jordan opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrising."
04Nm 34:16 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 34:17 "These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance£º Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
04Nm 34:18 "And you shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance.
04Nm 34:19 "And these are the names of the men£º of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
04Nm 34:20 "And of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud.
04Nm 34:21 "Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
04Nm 34:22 "And of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli.
04Nm 34:23 "Of the sons of Joseph£º of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
04Nm 34:24 "And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
04Nm 34:25 "And of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
04Nm 34:26 "And of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
04Nm 34:27 "And of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
04Nm 34:28 "And of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud."
04Nm 34:29 These are those whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.
04Nm 35:1 Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
04Nm 35:2 "Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession, cities to live in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities.
04Nm 35:3 "And the cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts.
04Nm 35:4 "And the pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites [shall extend] from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around.
04Nm 35:5 "You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities.
04Nm 35:6 "And the cities which you shall give to the Levites [shall be] the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities.
04Nm 35:7 "All the cities which you shall give to the Levites [shall be] forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands.
04Nm 35:8 "As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall take more from the larger and you shall take less from the smaller; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits."
04Nm 35:9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
04Nm 35:10 "Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 35:11 then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge, that the manslayer who has killed any person unintentionally may flee there.
04Nm 35:12 'And the cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation for trial.
04Nm 35:13 'And the cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge.
04Nm 35:14 'You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be cities of refuge.
