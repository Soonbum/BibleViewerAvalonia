05重 1:1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
05重 1:2 It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.
05重 1:3 And it came about in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had commanded him [to give] to them,
05重 1:4 after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
05重 1:5 Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying,
05重 1:6 "The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
05重 1:7 'Turn and set your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
05重 1:8 'See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to them and their descendants after them.'
05重 1:9 "And I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to bear [ the burden] of you alone.
05重 1:10 'The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
05重 1:11 'May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you, just as He has promised you!
05重 1:12 'How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife?
05重 1:13 'Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.'
05重 1:14 "And you answered me and said, 'The thing which you have said to do is good.'
05重 1:15 "So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands, and of hundreds, of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes.
05重 1:16 "Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear [the cases] between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him.
05重 1:17 'You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'
05重 1:18 "And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
05重 1:19 "Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
05重 1:20 "And I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us.
05重 1:21 'See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.'
05重 1:22 "Then all of you approached me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up, and the cities which we shall enter.'
05重 1:23 "And the thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe.
05重 1:24 "And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
05重 1:25 "Then they took [some] of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought us back a report and said, 'It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.'
05重 1:26 "Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;
05重 1:27 and you grumbled in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
05重 1:28 'Where can we go up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven. And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there."'
05重 1:29 "Then I said to you, 'Do not be shocked, nor fear them.
05重 1:30 'The LORD your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
05重 1:31 and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked, until you came to this place. '
05重 1:32 "But for all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,
05重 1:33 who goes before you on [your] way, to seek out a place for you to encamp, in fire by night and cloud by day, to show you the way in which you should go.
05重 1:34 "Then the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying,
05重 1:35 'Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers,
05重 1:36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot, because he has followed the LORD fully. '
05重 1:37 "The LORD was angry with me also on your account, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there.
05重 1:38 'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there; encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
05重 1:39 'Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.
05重 1:40 'But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.'
05重 1:41 "Then you answered and said to me, 'We have sinned against the LORD; we will indeed go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.
05重 1:42 "And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them," Do not go up, nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be defeated before your enemies. "'
05重 1:43 "So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country.
05重 1:44 "And the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you, and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah.
05重 1:45 "Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice, nor give ear to you.
05重 1:46 "So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent [there].
05重 2:1 "Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and circled Mount Seir for many days.
05重 2:2 "And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
05重 2:3 'You have circled this mountain long enough. [Now] turn north,
05重 2:4 and command the people, saying, "You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful;
05重 2:5 do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, even [as little as] a footstep because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
05重 2:6 "You shall buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.
05重 2:7 "For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing." '
05重 2:8 "So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
05重 2:9 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.
05重 2:10 (The Emim lived there formerly, a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim.
05重 2:11 Like the Anakim, they are also regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
05重 2:12 The Horites formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them.)
05重 2:13 'Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.' So we crossed over the brook Zered.
05重 2:14 "Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea, until we crossed over the brook Zered, was thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
05重 2:15 "Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp, until they all perished.
05重 2:16 "So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people,
05重 2:17 that the LORD spoke to me, saying,
05重 2:18 'You shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab, today.
05重 2:19 'And when you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.'
05重 2:20 (It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, [for] Rephaim formerly lived in it, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin,
05重 2:21 a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them before them. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
05重 2:22 just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and they dispossessed them, and settled in their place even to this day.
05重 2:23 And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)
05重 2:24 'Arise, set out, and pass through the valley of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle.
05重 2:25 'This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
05重 2:26 "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
05重 2:27 'Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05重 2:28 'You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot,
05重 2:29 just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving to us. '
05重 2:30 "But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to deliver him into your hand, as [he is] today.
05重 2:31 "And the LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to occupy, that you may possess his land.'
05重 2:32 "Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz.
05重 2:33 "And the LORD our God delivered him over to us; and we defeated him with his sons and all his people.
05重 2:34 "So we captured all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city. We left no survivor.
05重 2:35 "We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
05重 2:36 "From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and [from] the city which is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the LORD our God delivered all over to us.
05重 2:37 "Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us.
05重 3:1 "Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
05重 3:2 "But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'
05重 3:3 "So the LORD our God delivered Og also, king of Bashan, with all his people into our hand, and we smote them until no survivor was left.
05重 3:4 "And we captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05重 3:5 "All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns.
05重 3:6 "And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city.
05重 3:7 "But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty.
05重 3:8 "Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon
05重 3:9 (Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir)
05重 3:10 all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
05重 3:11 (For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.)
05重 3:12 "So we took possession of this land at that time. From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
05重 3:13 "And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim.
05重 3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, [that is], Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, [as it is] to this day.)
05重 3:15 "And to Machir I gave Gilead.
05重 3:16 "And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;
05重 3:17 the Arabah also, with the Jordan as [a] border, from Chinnereth even as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
05重 3:18 "Then I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel.
05重 3:19 'But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock), shall remain in your cities which I have given you,
05重 3:20 until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God will give them beyond the Jordan. Then you may return every man to his possession, which I have given you. '
05重 3:21 "And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.
05重 3:22 'Do not fear them, for the LORD your God is the one fighting for you.'
05重 3:23 "I also pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
05重 3:24 'O Lord GOD, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness and Thy strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as Thine?
05重 3:25 'Let me, I pray, cross over and see the fair land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'
05重 3:26 "But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, 'Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter.
05重 3:27 'Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see [it] with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
05重 3:28 'But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he shall give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.'
05重 3:29 "So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
05重 4:1 "And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, in order that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
05重 4:2 "You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
05重 4:3 "Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you.
05重 4:4 "But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you.
05重 4:5 "See, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it.
05重 4:6 "So keep and do [them], for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
05重 4:7 "For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him?
05重 4:8 "Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today?
05重 4:9 "Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons.
05重 4:10 "[Remember] the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people to Me, that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.'
05重 4:11 "And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the [very] heart of the heavens darkness, cloud and thick gloom.
05重 4:12 "Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form-- only a voice.
05重 4:13 "So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, [that is,] the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
05重 4:14 "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it.
05重 4:15 "So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,
05重 4:16 lest you act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
05重 4:17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
05重 4:18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth.
05重 4:19 "And [beware,] lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.
05重 4:20 "But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as today.
05重 4:21 "Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05重 4:22 "For I shall die in this land, I shall not cross the Jordan, but you shall cross and take possession of this good land.
05重 4:23 "So watch yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything [against] which the LORD your God has commanded you.
05重 4:24 "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
05重 4:25 "When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD your God [so as] to provoke Him to anger,
05重 4:26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you shall surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it. You shall not live long on it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
05重 4:27 "And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where the LORD shall drive you.
05重 4:28 "And there you will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
05重 4:29 "But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find [Him] if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.
05重 4:30 "When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice.
05重 4:31 "For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.
05重 4:32 "Indeed, ask now concerning the former days which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and [inquire] from one end of the heavens to the other. Has [anything] been done like this great thing, or has [anything] been heard like it?
05重 4:33 "Has [any] people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard [it], and survived?
05重 4:34 "Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within [ another] nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
05重 4:35 "To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.
05重 4:36 "Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire.
05重 4:37 "Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them. And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power,
05重 4:38 driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in [and] to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.
05重 4:39 "Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.
05重 4:40 "So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
05重 4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east,
05重 4:42 that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live
05重 4:43 Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
05重 4:44 Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel;
05重 4:45 these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out from Egypt,
05重 4:46 across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt.
05重 4:47 And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, [who were] across the Jordan to the east,
05重 4:48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),
05重 4:49 with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.
05重 5:1 Then Moses summoned all Israel, and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I am speaking today in your hearing, that you may learn them and observe them carefully.
05重 5:2 "The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
05重 5:3 "The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, [with] all those of us alive here today.
05重 5:4 "The LORD spoke to you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire,
05重 5:5 [while] I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said,
05重 5:6 'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 5:7 'You shall have no other gods before Me.
05重 5:8 'You shall not make for yourself an idol, [or] any likeness [of] what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
05重 5:9 'You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth [generations] of those who hate Me,
05重 5:10 but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
05重 5:11 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
05重 5:12 'Observe the sabbath day to keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.
05重 5:13 'Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
05重 5:14 but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; [in it] you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
05重 5:15 'And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day.
05重 5:16 'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you on the land which the LORD your God gives you.
05重 5:17 'You shall not murder.
05重 5:18 'You shall not commit adultery.
05重 5:19 'You shall not steal.
05重 5:20 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
05重 5:21 'You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.'
05重 5:22 "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, [of] the cloud and [of] the thick gloom, with a great voice, and He added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
05重 5:23 "And it came about, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
05重 5:24 "And you said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives.
05重 5:25 'Now then why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we shall die.
05重 5:26 'For who is there of all flesh, who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we [have], and lived?
05重 5:27 'Go near and hear all that the LORD our God says; then speak to us all that the LORD our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do [it.]'
05重 5:28 "And the LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
05重 5:29 'Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear Me, and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and with their sons forever!
05重 5:30 'Go, say to them, "Return to your tents."
05重 5:31 'But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe [them] in the land which I give them to possess.'
05重 5:32 "So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05重 5:33 "You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong [your] days in the land which you shall possess.
05重 6:1 "Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded [me] to teach you, that you might do [them] in the land where you are going over to possess it,
05重 6:2 so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
05重 6:3 "O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do [it], that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, [in] a land flowing with milk and honey.
05重 6:4 "Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!
05重 6:5 "And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
05重 6:6 "And these words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart;
05重 6:7 and you shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.
05重 6:8 "And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
05重 6:9 "And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
05重 6:10 "Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build,
05重 6:11 and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you shall eat and be satisfied,
05重 6:12 then watch yourself, lest you forget the LORD who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 6:13 "You shall fear [only] the LORD your God; and you shall worship Him, and swear by His name.
05重 6:14 "You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you,
05重 6:15 for the LORD your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.
05重 6:16 "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested [Him] at Massah.
05重 6:17 "You should diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you.
05重 6:18 "And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to [give] your fathers,
05重 6:19 by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.
05重 6:20 "When your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What [do] the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments [mean] which the LORD our God commanded you?'
05重 6:21 then you shall say to your son, 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt; and the LORD brought us from Egypt with a mighty hand.
05重 6:22 'Moreover, the LORD showed great and distressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh and all his household;
05重 6:23 and He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which He had sworn to our fathers. '
05重 6:24 "So the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God for our good always and for our survival, as [it is] today.
05重 6:25 "And it will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the LORD our God, just as He commanded us.
05重 7:1 "When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you are entering to possess it, and shall clear away many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you,
05重 7:2 and when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you, and you shall defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them.
05重 7:3 "Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons.
05重 7:4 "For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and He will quickly destroy you.
05重 7:5 "But thus you shall do to them you shall tear down their altars, and smash their [sacred] pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
05重 7:6 "For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
05重 7:7 "The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
05重 7:8 but because the LORD loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05重 7:9 "Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;
05重 7:10 but repays those who hate Him to their faces, to destroy them; He will not delay with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face.
05重 7:11 "Therefore, you shall keep the commandment and the statutes and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.
05重 7:12 "Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you His covenant and His lovingkindness which He swore to your forefathers.
05重 7:13 "And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you.
05重 7:14 "You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall be no male or female barren among you or among your cattle.
05重 7:15 "And the LORD will remove from you all sickness; and He will not put on you any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will lay them on all who hate you.
05重 7:16 "And you shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God will deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them, neither shall you serve their gods, for that [would be] a snare to you.
05重 7:17 "If you should say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?'
05重 7:18 you shall not be afraid of them; you shall well remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt
05重 7:19 the great trials which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
05重 7:20 "Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish.
05重 7:21 "You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
05重 7:22 "And the LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, lest the wild beasts grow too numerous for you.
05重 7:23 "But the LORD your God shall deliver them before you, and will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
05重 7:24 "And He will deliver their kings into your hand so that you shall make their name perish from under heaven; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.
05重 7:25 "The graven images of their gods you are to burn with fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
05重 7:26 "And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and like it come under the ban; you shall utterly detest it and you shall utterly abhor it, for it is something banned.
05重 8:1 "All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore [to give] to your forefathers.
05重 8:2 "And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
05重 8:3 "And He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD.
05重 8:4 "Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.
05重 8:5 "Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.
05重 8:6 "Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.
05重 8:7 "For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
05重 8:8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;
05重 8:9 a land where you shall eat food without scarcity, in which you shall not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
05重 8:10 "When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you.
05重 8:11 "Beware lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today;
05重 8:12 lest, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived [in them],
05重 8:13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have multiplies,
05重 8:14 then your heart becomes proud, and you forget the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 8:15 "He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, [with its] fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint.
05重 8:16 "In the wilderness He fed you manna which your fathers did not know, that He might humble you and that He might test you, to do good for you in the end.
05重 8:17 "Otherwise, you may say in your heart, 'My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.'
05重 8:18 "But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as [it is] this day.
05重 8:19 "And it shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God, and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you shall surely perish.
05重 8:20 "Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you would not listen to the voice of the LORD your God.
05重 9:1 "Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven,
05重 9:2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard [it said], 'Who can stand before the sons of Anak?'
05重 9:3 "Know therefore today that it is the LORD your God who is crossing over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as the LORD has spoken to you.
05重 9:4 "Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them out before you, 'Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,' but [it is] because of the wickedness of these nations [that] the LORD is dispossessing them before you.
05重 9:5 "It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but [it is] because of the wickedness of these nations [that] the LORD your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05重 9:6 "Know, then, [it is] not because of your righteousness [that] the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people.
05重 9:7 "Remember, do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
05重 9:8 "Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you.
05重 9:9 "When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD had made with you, then I remained on the mountain forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
05重 9:10 "And the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written by the finger of God; and on them [were] all the words which the LORD had spoken with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
05重 9:11 "And it came about at the end of forty days and nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
05重 9:12 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made a molten image for themselves.'
05重 9:13 "The LORD spoke further to me, saying, 'I have seen this people, and indeed, it is a stubborn people.
05重 9:14 'Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.'
05重 9:15 "So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
05重 9:16 "And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God. You had made for yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
05重 9:17 "And I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands, and smashed them before your eyes.
05重 9:18 "And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger.
05重 9:19 "For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wrathful against you in order to destroy you, but the LORD listened to me that time also.
05重 9:20 "And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.
05重 9:21 "And I took your sinful [thing], the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain.
05重 9:22 "Again at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath.
05重 9:23 "And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and possess the land which I have given you,' then you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither believed Him nor listened to His voice.
05重 9:24 "You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day I knew you.
05重 9:25 "So I fell down before the LORD the forty days and nights, which I did because the LORD had said He would destroy you.
05重 9:26 "And I prayed to the LORD, and said, 'O Lord GOD, do not destroy Thy people, even Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, whom Thou hast brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05重 9:27 'Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or their sin.
05重 9:28 'Otherwise the land from which Thou didst bring us may say, "Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness."
05重 9:29 'Yet they are Thy people, even Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast brought out by Thy great power and Thine outstretched arm.'
05重 10:1 "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood for yourself.
05重 10:2 'And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.'
05重 10:3 "So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
05重 10:4 "And He wrote on the tablets, like the former writing, the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the LORD gave them to me.
05重 10:5 "Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me."
05重 10:6 (Now the sons of Israel set out from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place.
05重 10:7 From there they set out to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
05重 10:8 At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day.
05重 10:9 Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, just as the LORD your God spoke to him.)
05重 10:10 "I, moreover, stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the LORD listened to me that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you.
05重 10:11 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.'
05重 10:12 "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
05重 10:13 [and] to keep the Lord's commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?
05重 10:14 "Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.
05重 10:15 "Yet on your fathers did the LORD set His affection to love them, and He chose their descendants after them, [even] you above all peoples, as [it is] this day.
05重 10:16 "Circumcise then your heart, and stiffen your neck no more.
05重 10:17 "For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God who does not show partiality, nor take a bribe.
05重 10:18 "He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.
05重 10:19 "So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
05重 10:20 "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and you shall swear by His name.
05重 10:21 "He is your praise and He is your God, who has done these great and awesome things for you which your eyes have seen.
05重 10:22 "Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons [in all,] and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.
05重 11:1 "You shall therefore love the LORD your God, and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.
05重 11:2 "And know this day that I [am] not [speaking] with your sons who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of the LORD your God-- His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm,
05重 11:3 and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land;
05重 11:4 and what He did to Egypt's army, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea to engulf them while they were pursuing you, and the LORD completely destroyed them;
05重 11:5 and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
05重 11:6 and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, among all Israel--
05重 11:7 but your own eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did.
05重 11:8 "You shall therefore keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and possess the land into which you are about to cross to possess it;
05重 11:9 so that you may prolong [your] days on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05重 11:10 "For the land, into which you are entering to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you used to sow your seed and water it with your foot like a vegetable garden.
05重 11:11 "But the land into which you are about to cross to possess it, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven,
05重 11:12 a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning even to the end of the year.
05重 11:13 "And it shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,
05重 11:14 that He will give the rain for your land in its season, the early and late rain, that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your oil.
05重 11:15 "And He will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you shall eat and be satisfied.
05重 11:16 "Beware, lest your hearts be deceived and you turn away and serve other gods and worship them.
05重 11:17 "Or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its fruit; and you will perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you.
05重 11:18 "You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
05重 11:19 "And you shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up.
05重 11:20 "And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
05重 11:21 so that your days and the days of your sons may be multiplied on the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens [remain] above the earth.
05重 11:22 "For if you are careful to keep all this commandment which I am commanding you, to do it, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and hold fast to Him;
05重 11:23 then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
05重 11:24 "Every place on which the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours; your border shall be from the wilderness to Lebanon, [and] from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea.
05重 11:25 "There shall no man be able to stand before you; the LORD your God shall lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land on which you set foot, as He has spoken to you.
05重 11:26 "See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse
05重 11:27 the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today;
05重 11:28 and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following other gods which you have not known.
05重 11:29 "And it shall come about, when the LORD your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, that you shall place the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
05重 11:30 "Are they not across the Jordan, west of the way toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
05重 11:31 "For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it,
05重 11:32 and you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you today.
05重 12:1 "These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth.
05重 12:2 "You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
05重 12:3 "And you shall tear down their altars and smash their [sacred] pillars and burn their Asherim with fire, and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods, and you shall obliterate their name from that place.
05重 12:4 "You shall not act like this toward the LORD your God.
05重 12:5 "But you shall seek [the] [LORD] at the place which the LORD your God shall choose from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His dwelling, and there you shall come.
05重 12:6 "And there you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings, and the first-born of your herd and of your flock.
05重 12:7 "There also you and your households shall eat before the LORD your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the LORD your God has blessed you.
05重 12:8 "You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, every man [doing] whatever is right in his own eyes;
05重 12:9 for you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 12:10 "When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around [you] so that you live in security,
05重 12:11 then it shall come about that the place in which the LORD your God shall choose for His name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice votive offerings which you will vow to the LORD.
05重 12:12 "And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
05重 12:13 "Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every [cultic] place you see,
05重 12:14 but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
05重 12:15 "However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, whatever you desire, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the deer.
05重 12:16 "Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 12:17 "You are not allowed to eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or new wine, or oil, or the first-born of your herd or flock, or any of your votive offerings which you vow, or your freewill offerings, or the contribution of your hand.
05重 12:18 "But you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and daughter, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all your undertakings.
05重 12:19 "Be careful that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
05重 12:20 "When the LORD your God extends your border as He has promised you, and you say, 'I will eat meat,' because you desire to eat meat, [then] you may eat meat, whatever you desire.
05重 12:21 "If the place which the LORD your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you may slaughter of your herd and flock which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates whatever you desire.
05重 12:22 "Just as a gazelle or a deer is eaten, so you shall eat it; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it.
05重 12:23 "Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
05重 12:24 "You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 12:25 "You shall not eat it, in order that it may be well with you and your sons after you, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of the LORD.
05重 12:26 "Only your holy things which you may have and your votive offerings, you shall take and go to the place which the LORD chooses.
05重 12:27 "And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh.
05重 12:28 "Be careful to listen to all these words which I command you, in order that it may be well with you and your sons after you forever, for you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05重 12:29 "When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,
05重 12:30 beware that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, ' How do these nations serve their gods, that I also may do likewise? '
05重 12:31 "You shall not behave thus toward the LORD your God, for every abominable act which the LORD hates they have done for their gods; for they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
05重 12:32 "Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it.
05重 13:1 "If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,
05重 13:2 and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, 'Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,'
05重 13:3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to find out if you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05重 13:4 "You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and cling to Him.
05重 13:5 "But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. So you shall purge the evil from among you.
05重 13:6 "If your brother, your mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom neither you nor your fathers have known,
05重 13:7 of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),
05重 13:8 you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.
05重 13:9 "But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
05重 13:10 "So you shall stone him to death because he has sought to seduce you from the LORD your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
05重 13:11 "Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you.
05重 13:12 "If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to live in, [anyone] saying [that]
05重 13:13 some worthless men have gone out from among you and have seduced the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' (whom you have not known),
05重 13:14 then you shall investigate and search out and inquire thoroughly. And if it is true [and] the matter established that this abomination has been done among you,
05重 13:15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it and its cattle with the edge of the sword.
05重 13:16 "Then you shall gather all its booty into the middle of its open square and burn the city and all its booty with fire as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God; and it shall be a ruin forever. It shall never be rebuilt.
05重 13:17 "And nothing from that which is put under the ban shall cling to your hand, in order that the LORD may turn from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He has sworn to your fathers,
05重 13:18 if you will listen to the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments which I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
05重 14:1 "You are the sons of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead.
05重 14:2 "For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
05重 14:3 "You shall not eat any detestable thing.
05重 14:4 "These are the animals which you may eat the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05重 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.
05重 14:6 "And any animal that divides the hoof and has the hoof split in two [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat.
05重 14:7 "Nevertheless, you are not to eat of these among those which chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two the camel and the rabbit and the rock-badger, for though they chew the cud, they do not divide the hoof; they are unclean for you.
05重 14:8 "And the pig, because it divides the hoof but [does] not [chew] the cud, it is unclean for you. You shall not eat any of their flesh nor touch their carcasses.
05重 14:9 "These you may eat of all that are in water anything that has fins and scales you may eat,
05重 14:10 but anything that does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.
05重 14:11 "You may eat any clean bird.
05重 14:12 "But these are the ones which you shall not eat the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard,
05重 14:13 and the red kite, the falcon, and the kite in their kinds,
05重 14:14 and every raven in its kind,
05重 14:15 and the ostrich, the owl, the sea gull, and the hawk in their kinds,

05重 14:19 "And all the teeming life with wings are unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
05重 14:20 "You may eat any clean bird.
05重 14:21 "You shall not eat anything which dies [of itself.] You may give it to the alien who is in your town, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
05重 14:22 "You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you sow, which comes out of the field every year.
05重 14:23 "And you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first-born of your herd and your flock, in order that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.
05重 14:24 "And if the distance is so great for you that you are not able to bring [the tithe,] since the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His name is too far away from you when the LORD your God blesses you,
05重 14:25 then you shall exchange [it] for money, and bind the money in your hand and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses.
05重 14:26 "And you may spend the money for whatever your heart desires, for oxen, or sheep, or wine, or strong drink, or whatever your heart desires; and there you shall eat in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household.
05重 14:27 "Also you shall not neglect the Levite who is in your town, for he has no portion or inheritance among you.
05重 14:28 "At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall deposit [it] in your town.
05重 14:29 "And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance among you, and the alien, the orphan and the widow who are in your town, shall come and eat and be satisfied, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
05重 15:1 "At the end of [every] seven years you shall grant a remission [of debts.]
05重 15:2 "And this is the manner of remission every creditor shall release what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because the Lord's remission has been proclaimed.
05重 15:3 "From a foreigner you may exact [it,] but your hand shall release whatever of yours is with your brother.
05重 15:4 "However, there shall be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess,
05重 15:5 if only you listen obediently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all this commandment which I am commanding you today.
05重 15:6 "For the LORD your God shall bless you as He has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.
05重 15:7 "If there is a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother;
05重 15:8 but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need [in] whatever he lacks.
05重 15:9 "Beware, lest there is a base thought in your heart, saying, 'The seventh year, the year of remission, is near,' and your eye is hostile toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry to the LORD against you, and it will be a sin in you.
05重 15:10 "You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.
05重 15:11 "For the poor will never cease [to be] in the land; therefore I command you, saying, 'You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.'
05重 15:12 "If your kinsman, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, then he shall serve you six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him free.
05重 15:13 "And when you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed.
05重 15:14 "You shall furnish him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat; you shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.
05重 15:15 "And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today.
05重 15:16 "And it shall come about if he says to you, 'I will not go out from you,' because he loves you and your household, since he fares well with you;
05重 15:17 then you shall take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your servant forever. And also you shall do likewise to your maidservant.
05重 15:18 "It shall not seem hard to you when you set him free, for he has given you six years [with] double the service of a hired man; so the LORD your God will bless you in whatever you do.
05重 15:19 "You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all the first-born males that are born of your herd and of your flock; you shall not work with the first-born of your herd, nor shear the first-born of your flock.
05重 15:20 "You and your household shall eat it every year before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses.
05重 15:21 "But if it has any defect, [such as] lameness or blindness, [or] any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
05重 15:22 "You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike [may eat it,] as a gazelle or a deer.
05重 15:23 "Only you shall not eat its blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
05重 16:1 "Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
05重 16:2 "And you shall sacrifice the Passover to the LORD your God from the flock and the herd, in the place where the LORD chooses to establish His name.
05重 16:3 "You shall not eat leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it unleavened bread, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste), in order that you may remember all the days of your life the day when you came out of the land of Egypt.
05重 16:4 "For seven days no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory, and none of the flesh which you sacrifice on the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning.
05重 16:5 "You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover in any of your towns which the LORD your God is giving you;
05重 16:6 but at the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His name, you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening at sunset, at the time that you came out of Egypt.
05重 16:7 "And you shall cook and eat [it] in the place which the LORD your God chooses. And in the morning you are to return to your tents.
05重 16:8 "Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God; you shall do no work [on it.]
05重 16:9 "You shall count seven weeks for yourself; you shall begin to count seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
05重 16:10 "Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give just as the LORD your God blesses you;
05重 16:11 and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite who is in your town, and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are in your midst, in the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His name.
05重 16:12 "And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall be careful to observe these statutes.
05重 16:13 "You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths seven days after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and your wine vat;
05重 16:14 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are in your towns.
05重 16:15 "Seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you shall be altogether joyful.
05重 16:16 "Three times in a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread and at the Feast of Weeks and at the Feast of Booths, and they shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed.
05重 16:17 "Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you.
05重 16:18 "You shall appoint for yourself judges and officers in all your towns which the LORD your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
05重 16:19 "You shall not distort justice; you shall not be partial, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
05重 16:20 "Justice, [and only] justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you.
05重 16:21 "You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make for yourself.
05重 16:22 "Neither shall you set up for yourself a [sacred] pillar which the LORD your God hates.
05重 17:1 "You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep which has a blemish or any defect, for that is a detestable thing to the LORD your God.
05重 17:2 "If there is found in your midst, in any of your towns, which the LORD your God is giving you, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, by transgressing His covenant,
05重 17:3 and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host, which I have not commanded,
05重 17:4 and if it is told you and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire thoroughly. And behold, if it is true and the thing certain that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
05重 17:5 then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil deed, to your gates, [that is,] the man or the woman, and you shall stone them to death.
05重 17:6 "On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death; he shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness.
05重 17:7 "The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.
05重 17:8 "If any case is too difficult for you to decide, between one kind of homicide or another, between one kind of lawsuit or another, and between one kind of assault or another, being cases of dispute in your courts, then you shall arise and go up to the place which the LORD your God chooses.
05重 17:9 "So you shall come to the Levitical priest or the judge who is [in office] in those days, and you shall inquire [of them,] and they will declare to you the verdict in the case.
05重 17:10 "And you shall do according to the terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the LORD chooses; and you shall be careful to observe according to all that they teach you.
05重 17:11 "According to the terms of the law which they teach you, and according to the verdict which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, to the right or the left.
05重 17:12 "And the man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, nor to the judge, that man shall die; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.
05重 17:13 "Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again.
05重 17:14 "When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you possess it and live in it, and you say, 'I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me,'
05重 17:15 you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses, [one] from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman.
05重 17:16 "Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since the LORD has said to you, 'You shall never again return that way.'
05重 17:17 "Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away; nor shall he greatly increase silver and gold for himself.
05重 17:18 "Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
05重 17:19 "And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law and these statutes,
05重 17:20 that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or the left; in order that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel.
05重 18:1 "The Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the Lord's offerings by fire and His portion.
05重 18:2 "And they shall have no inheritance among their countrymen; the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them.
05重 18:3 "Now this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, either an ox or a sheep, of which they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.
05重 18:4 "You shall give him the first fruits of your grain, your new wine, and your oil, and the first shearing of your sheep.
05重 18:5 "For the LORD your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes, to stand and serve in the name of the LORD forever.
05重 18:6 "Now if a Levite comes from any of your towns throughout Israel where he resides, and comes whenever he desires to the place which the LORD chooses,
05重 18:7 then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD.
05重 18:8 "They shall eat equal portions, except [what they receive] from the sale of their fathers' [estates.]
05重 18:9 "When you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable things of those nations.
05重 18:10 "There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,
05重 18:11 or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.
05重 18:12 "For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD; and because of these detestable things the LORD your God will drive them out before you.
05重 18:13 "You shall be blameless before the LORD your God.
05重 18:14 "For those nations, which you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you [to do] so.
05重 18:15 "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.
05重 18:16 "This is according to all that you asked of the LORD your God in Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, let me not see this great fire anymore, lest I die.'
05重 18:17 "And the LORD said to me, 'They have spoken well.
05重 18:18 'I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.
05重 18:19 'And it shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require [it] of him.
05重 18:20 'But the prophet who shall speak a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.'
05重 18:21 "And you may say in your heart, 'How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?'
05重 18:22 "When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.
05重 19:1 "When the LORD your God cuts off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you dispossess them and settle in their cities and in their houses,
05重 19:2 you shall set aside three cities for yourself in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess.
05重 19:3 "You shall prepare the roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land, which the LORD your God will give you as a possession, so that any manslayer may flee there.
05重 19:4 "Now this is the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live when he kills his friend unintentionally, not hating him previously--
05重 19:5 as when [a man] goes into the forest with his friend to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron [head] slips off the handle and strikes his friend so that he dies-- he may flee to one of these cities and live;
05重 19:6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer in the heat of his anger, and overtake him, because the way is long, and take his life, though he was not deserving of death, since he had not hated him previously.
05重 19:7 "Therefore, I command you, saying, 'You shall set aside three cities for yourself.'
05重 19:8 "And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, just as He has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which He promised to give your fathers--
05重 19:9 if you carefully observe all this commandment, which I command you today, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in His ways always-- then you shall add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.
05重 19:10 "So innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance, and bloodguiltiness be on you.
05重 19:11 "But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and rises up against him and strikes him so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities,
05重 19:12 then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
05重 19:13 "You shall not pity him, but you shall purge the blood of the innocent from Israel, that it may go well with you.
05重 19:14 "You shall not move your neighbor's boundary mark, which the ancestors have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess.
05重 19:15 "A single witness shall not rise up against a man on account of any iniquity or any sin which he has committed; on the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.

05重 27:13 "And for the curse, these shall stand on Mount Ebal Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
05重 27:14 "The Levites shall then answer and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
05重 27:15 'Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets [ it] up in secret.' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:16 'Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:17 'Cursed is he who moves his neighbor's boundary mark.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:18 'Cursed is he who misleads a blind [person] on the road.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:19 'Cursed is he who distorts the justice due an alien, orphan, and widow.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:20 'Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he has uncovered his father's skirt.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:21 'Cursed is he who lies with any animal.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:22 'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or of his mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:23 'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:24 'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:25 'Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 27:26 'Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
05重 28:1 "Now it shall be, if you will diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
05重 28:2 "And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you will obey the LORD your God.
05重 28:3 "Blessed [shall] you [be] in the city, and blessed [shall] you [be] in the country.
05重 28:4 "Blessed [shall be] the offspring of your body and the produce of your ground and the offspring of your beasts, the increase of your herd and the young of your flock.
05重 28:5 "Blessed [shall be] your basket and your kneading bowl.
05重 28:6 "Blessed [shall] you [be] when you come in, and blessed [shall] you [be] when you go out.
05重 28:7 "The LORD will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they shall come out against you one way and shall flee before you seven ways.
05重 28:8 "The LORD will command the blessing upon you in your barns and in all that you put your hand to, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
05重 28:9 "The LORD will establish you as a holy people to Himself, as He swore to you, if you will keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways.
05重 28:10 "So all the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of you.
05重 28:11 "And the LORD will make you abound in prosperity, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your beast and in the produce of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
05重 28:12 "The LORD will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens, to give rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hand; and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.
05重 28:13 "And the LORD shall make you the head and not the tail, and you only shall be above, and you shall not be underneath, if you will listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I charge you today, to observe [them] carefully,
05重 28:14 and do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
05重 28:15 "But it shall come about, if you will not obey the LORD your God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you.
05重 28:16 "Cursed [shall] you [be] in the city, and cursed [shall] you [be] in the country.

05重 28:20 "The LORD will send upon you curses, confusion, and rebuke, in all you undertake to do, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly, on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken Me.
05重 28:21 "The LORD will make the pestilence cling to you until He has consumed you from the land, where you are entering to possess it.
05重 28:22 "The LORD will smite you with consumption and with fever and with inflammation and with fiery heat and with the sword and with blight and with mildew, and they shall pursue you until you perish.
05重 28:23 "And the heaven which is over your head shall be bronze, and the earth which is under you, iron.
05重 28:24 "The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust; from heaven it shall come down on you until you are destroyed.
05重 28:25 "The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, but you shall flee seven ways before them, and you shall be [an example of] terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
05重 28:26 "And your carcasses shall be food to all birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten [them] away.
05重 28:27 "The LORD will smite you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scab and with the itch, from which you cannot be healed.
05重 28:28 "The LORD will smite you with madness and with blindness and with bewilderment of heart;
05重 28:29 and you shall grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways; but you shall only be oppressed and robbed continually, with none to save you.
05重 28:30 "You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall violate her; you shall build a house, but you shall not live in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but you shall not use its fruit.
05重 28:31 "Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it; your donkey shall be torn away from you, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you.
05重 28:32 "Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes shall look on and yearn for them continually; but there shall be nothing you can do.
05重 28:33 "A people whom you do not know shall eat up the produce of your ground and all your labors, and you shall never be anything but oppressed and crushed continually.
05重 28:34 "And you shall be driven mad by the sight of what you see.
05重 28:35 "The LORD will strike you on the knees and legs with sore boils, from which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
05重 28:36 "The LORD will bring you and your king, whom you shall set over you, to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone.

05重 28:38 "You shall bring out much seed to the field but you shall gather in little, for the locust shall consume it.
05重 28:39 "You shall plant and cultivate vineyards, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather [the grapes,] for the worm shall devour them.
05重 28:40 "You shall have olive trees throughout your territory but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives shall drop off.
05重 28:41 "You shall have sons and daughters but they shall not be yours, for they shall go into captivity.
05重 28:42 "The cricket shall possess all your trees and the produce of your ground.
05重 28:43 "The alien who is among you shall rise above you higher and higher, but you shall go down lower and lower.
05重 28:44 "He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
05重 28:45 "So all these curses shall come on you and pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you would not obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.
05重 28:46 "And they shall become a sign and a wonder on you and your descendants forever.
05重 28:47 "Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and a glad heart, for the abundance of all things;
05重 28:48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and He will put an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.
05重 28:49 "The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down, a nation whose language you shall not understand,
05重 28:50 a nation of fierce countenance who shall have no respect for the old, nor show favor to the young.
05重 28:51 "Moreover, it shall eat the offspring of your herd and the produce of your ground until you are destroyed, who also leaves you no grain, new wine, or oil, nor the increase of your herd or the young of your flock until they have caused you to perish.
05重 28:52 "And it shall besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout your land, and it shall besiege you in all your towns throughout your land which the LORD your God has given you.
05重 28:53 "Then you shall eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy shall oppress you.
05重 28:54 "The man who is refined and very delicate among you shall be hostile toward his brother and toward the wife he cherishes and toward the rest of his children who remain,
05重 28:55 so that he will not give [even] one of them any of the flesh of his children which he shall eat, since he has nothing [else] left, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy shall oppress you in all your towns.
05重 28:56 "The refined and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and refinement, shall be hostile toward the husband she cherishes and toward her son and daughter,
05重 28:57 and toward her afterbirth which issues from between her legs and toward her children whom she bears; for she shall eat them secretly for lack of anything [else,] during the siege and the distress by which your enemy shall oppress you in your towns.
05重 28:58 "If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, to fear this honored and awesome name, the LORD your God,
05重 28:59 then the LORD will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, even severe and lasting plagues, and miserable and chronic sicknesses.
05重 28:60 "And He will bring back on you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid, and they shall cling to you.
05重 28:61 "Also every sickness and every plague which, not written in the book of this law, the LORD will bring on you until you are destroyed.
05重 28:62 "Then you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
05重 28:63 "And it shall come about that as the LORD delighted over you to prosper you, and multiply you, so the LORD will delight over you to make you perish and destroy you; and you shall be torn from the land where you are entering to possess it.
05重 28:64 "Moreover, the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, which you or your fathers have not known.
05重 28:65 "And among those nations you shall find no rest, and there shall be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul.
05重 28:66 "So your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall be in dread night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
05重 28:67 "In the morning you shall say, 'Would that it were evening!' And at evening you shall say, 'Would that it were morning!' because of the dread of your heart which you dread, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
05重 28:68 "And the LORD will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which I spoke to you, 'You will never see it again!' And there you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer."
05重 29:1 These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb.
05重 29:2 And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, "You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land;
05重 29:3 the great trials which your eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders.
05重 29:4 "Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to know, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear.
05重 29:5 "And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot.
05重 29:6 "You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, in order that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
05重 29:7 "When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle, but we defeated them;
05重 29:8 and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites.
05重 29:9 "So keep the words of this covenant to do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
05重 29:10 "You stand today, all of you, before the LORD your God your chiefs, your tribes, your elders and your officers, [even] all the men of Israel,
05重 29:11 your little ones, your wives, and the alien who is within your camps, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
05重 29:12 that you may enter into the covenant with the LORD your God, and into His oath which the LORD your God is making with you today,
05重 29:13 in order that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God, just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05重 29:14 "Now not with you alone am I making this covenant and this oath,
05重 29:15 but both with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God and with those who are not with us here today
05重 29:16 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed.
05重 29:17 "Moreover, you have seen their abominations and their idols [of] wood, stone, silver, and gold, which [they had] with them);
05重 29:18 lest there shall be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; lest there shall be among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood.
05重 29:19 "And it shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that he will boast, saying, 'I have peace though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart in order to destroy the watered [land] with the dry.'
05重 29:20 "The LORD shall never be willing to forgive him, but rather the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.
05重 29:21 "Then the LORD will single him out for adversity from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law.
05重 29:22 "Now the generation to come, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it, will say,
05重 29:23 'All its land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.'
05重 29:24 "And all the nations shall say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?'
05重 29:25 "Then [men] shall say, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
05重 29:26 'And they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted to them.
05重 29:27 'Therefore, the anger of the LORD burned against that land, to bring upon it every curse which is written in this book;
05重 29:28 and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and in fury and in great wrath, and cast them into another land, as [it is] this day. '
05重 29:29 "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law.
05重 30:1 "So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call [them] to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you,
05重 30:2 and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons,
05重 30:3 then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.
05重 30:4 "If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back.
05重 30:5 "And the LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.
05重 30:6 "Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may live.
05重 30:7 "And the LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
05重 30:8 "And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today.
05重 30:9 "Then the LORD your God will prosper you abundantly in all the work of your hand, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your ground, for the LORD will again rejoice over you for good, just as He rejoiced over your fathers;
05重 30:10 if you obey the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this book of the law, if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
05重 30:11 "For this commandment which I command you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach.
05重 30:12 "It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'
05重 30:13 "Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it, that we may observe it?'
05重 30:14 "But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may observe it.
05重 30:15 "See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and adversity;
05重 30:16 in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it.
05重 30:17 "But if your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them,
05重 30:18 I declare to you today that you shall surely perish. You shall not prolong [your] days in the land where you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it.
05重 30:19 "I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants,
05重 30:20 by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them. "
05重 31:1 So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
05重 31:2 And he said to them, "I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross this Jordan.'
05重 31:3 "It is the LORD your God who will cross ahead of you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who will cross ahead of you, just as the LORD has spoken.
05重 31:4 "And the LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them.
05重 31:5 "And the LORD will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
05重 31:6 "Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you."
05重 31:7 Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.
05重 31:8 "And the LORD is the one who goes ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear, or be dismayed."
05重 31:9 So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
05重 31:10 Then Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of [every] seven years, at the time of the year of remission of debts, at the Feast of Booths,
05重 31:11 when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing.
05重 31:12 "Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the alien who is in your town, in order that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God, and be careful to observe all the words of this law.
05重 31:13 "And their children, who have not known, will hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live on the land which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess."
05重 31:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, the time for you to die is near; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
05重 31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the doorway of the tent.
05重 31:16 And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the harlot with the strange gods of the land, into the midst of which they are going, and will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
05重 31:17 "Then My anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they shall be consumed, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?'
05重 31:18 "But I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods.
05重 31:19 "Now therefore, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it on their lips, in order that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel.
05重 31:20 "For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant.
05重 31:21 "Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants); for I know their intent which they are developing today, before I have brought them into the land which I swore."
05重 31:22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
05重 31:23 Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with you."
05重 31:24 And it came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book until they were complete,
05重 31:25 that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
05重 31:26 "Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may remain there as a witness against you.
05重 31:27 "For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death?
05重 31:28 "Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
05重 31:29 "For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, for you will do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands."
05重 31:30 Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete
05重 32:1 "Give ear, O heavens, and let me speak; And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
05重 32:2 "Let my teaching drop as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, As the droplets on the fresh grass And as the showers on the herb.
05重 32:3 "For I proclaim the name of the LORD; Ascribe greatness to our God!
05重 32:4 "The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.
05重 32:5 "They have acted corruptly toward Him, [They are] not His children, because of their defect; [But are] a perverse and crooked generation.
05重 32:6 "Do you thus repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is not He your Father who has bought you? He has made you and established you.
05重 32:7 "Remember the days of old, Consider the years of all generations. Ask your father, and he will inform you, Your elders, and they will tell you.
05重 32:8 "When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel.
05重 32:9 "For the Lord's portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.
05重 32:10 "He found him in a desert land, And in the howling waste of a wilderness; He encircled him, He cared for him, He guarded him as the pupil of His eye.
05重 32:11 "Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, That hovers over its young, He spread His wings and caught them, He carried them on His pinions.
05重 32:12 "The LORD alone guided him, And there was no foreign god with him.
05重 32:13 "He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the produce of the field; And He made him suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,
05重 32:14 Curds of cows, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat-- And of the blood of grapes you drank wine.
05重 32:15 "But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked-- You are grown fat, thick, and sleek-- Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his salvation.
05重 32:16 "They made Him jealous with strange [gods;] With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
05重 32:17 "They sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they have not known, New [gods] who came lately, Whom your fathers did not dread.
05重 32:18 "You neglected the Rock who begot you, And forgot the God who gave you birth.
05重 32:19 "And the LORD saw [this,] and spurned [them] Because of the provocation of His sons and daughters.
05重 32:20 "Then He said, 'I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end [shall be;] For they are a perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness.
05重 32:21 'They have made Me jealous with [what] is not God; They have provoked Me to anger with their idols. So I will make them jealous with [those who] are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation,
05重 32:22 For a fire is kindled in My anger, And burns to the lowest part of Sheol, And consumes the earth with its yield, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
05重 32:23 'I will heap misfortunes on them; I will use My arrows on them.
05重 32:24 '[They shall be] wasted by famine, and consumed by plague And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, With the venom of crawling things of the dust.
05重 32:25 'Outside the sword shall bereave, And inside terror-- Both young man and virgin, The nursling with the man of gray hair.
05重 32:26 'I would have said, "I will cut them to pieces, I will remove the memory of them from men,"
05重 32:27 Had I not feared the provocation by the enemy, Lest their adversaries should misjudge, Lest they should say, "Our hand is triumphant, And the LORD has not done all this." '
05重 32:28 "For they are a nation lacking in counsel, And there is no understanding in them.
05重 32:29 "Would that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would discern their future!
05重 32:30 "How could one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them, And the LORD had given them up?
05重 32:31 "Indeed their rock is not like our Rock, Even our enemies themselves judge this.
05重 32:32 "For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah; Their grapes are grapes of poison, Their clusters, bitter.
05重 32:33 "Their wine is the venom of serpents, And the deadly poison of cobras.
05重 32:34 'Is it not laid up in store with Me, Sealed up in My treasuries?
05重 32:35 'Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.'
05重 32:36 "For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants; When He sees that [their] strength is gone, And there is none [remaining,] bond or free.
05重 32:37 "And He will say, 'Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge?
05重 32:38 'Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their libation? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your hiding place!
05重 32:39 'See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded, and it is I who heal; And there is no one who can deliver from My hand.
05重 32:40 'Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live forever,
05重 32:41 If I sharpen My flashing sword, And My hand takes hold on justice, I will render vengeance on My adversaries, And I will repay those who hate Me.
05重 32:42 'I will make My arrows drunk with blood, And My sword shall devour flesh, With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the long-haired leaders of the enemy.'
05重 32:43 "Rejoice, O nations, [with] His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And will render vengeance on His adversaries, And will atone for His land [and] His people."
05重 32:44 Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he, with Joshua the son of Nun.
05重 32:45 When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
05重 32:46 he said to them, "Take to your heart all the words with which I am warning you today, which you shall command your sons to observe carefully, [even] all the words of this law.
05重 32:47 "For it is not an idle word for you; indeed it is your life. And by this word you shall prolong your days in the land, which you are about to cross the Jordan to possess."
05重 32:48 And the LORD spoke to Moses that very same day, saying,
05重 32:49 "Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel for a possession.
05重 32:50 "Then die on the mountain where you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,
05重 32:51 because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the sons of Israel.
05重 32:52 "For you shall see the land at a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving the sons of Israel."
05重 33:1 Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death.
05重 33:2 And he said, "The LORD came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them.
05重 33:3 "Indeed, He loves the people; All Thy holy ones are in Thy hand, And they followed in Thy steps; [Everyone] receives of Thy words.
05重 33:4 "Moses charged us with a law, A possession for the assembly of Jacob.
05重 33:5 "And He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, The tribes of Israel together.
05重 33:6 "May Reuben live and not die, Nor his men be few."
05重 33:7 And this regarding Judah; so he said, "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him to his people. With his hands he contended for them; And mayest Thou be a help against his adversaries."
05重 33:8 And of Levi he said, "[Let] Thy Thummim and Thy Urim [belong] to Thy godly man, Whom Thou didst prove at Massah, With whom Thou didst contend at the waters of Meribah;
05重 33:9 Who said of his father and his mother, 'I did not consider them'; And he did not acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he regard his own sons, For they observed Thy word, And kept Thy covenant.
05重 33:10 "They shall teach Thine ordinances to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel. They shall put incense before Thee, And whole burnt offerings on Thine altar.
05重 33:11 "O LORD, bless his substance, And accept the work of his hands; Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him, And those who hate him, so that they may not rise [again.]"
05重 33:12 Of Benjamin he said, "May the beloved of the LORD dwell in security by Him, Who shields him all the day, And he dwells between His shoulders."
05重 33:13 And of Joseph he said, "Blessed of the LORD [be] his land, With the choice things of heaven, with the dew, And from the deep lying beneath,
05重 33:14 And with the choice yield of the sun, And with the choice produce of the months.
05重 33:15 "And with the best things of the ancient mountains, And with the choice things of the everlasting hills,
05重 33:16 And with the choice things of the earth and its fulness, And the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush. Let it come to the head of Joseph, And to the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.
05重 33:17 "As the first-born of his ox, majesty is his, And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; With them he shall push the peoples, All at once, [ to] the ends of the earth. And those are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And those are the thousands of Manasseh."
05重 33:18 And of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going forth, And, Issachar, in your tents.
05重 33:19 "They shall call peoples [to] the mountain; There they shall offer righteous sacrifices; For they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand."
05重 33:20 And of Gad he said, "Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad; He lies down as a lion, And tears the arm, also the crown of the head.
05重 33:21 "Then he provided the first [part] for himself, For there the ruler's portion was reserved; And he came [with] the leaders of the people; He executed the justice of the LORD, And His ordinances with Israel."
05重 33:22 And of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's whelp, That leaps forth from Bashan."
05重 33:23 And of Naphtali he said, "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full of the blessing of the LORD, Take possession of the sea and the south."
05重 33:24 And of Asher he said, "More blessed than sons is Asher; May he be favored by his brothers, And may he dip his foot in oil.
05重 33:25 "Your locks shall be iron and bronze, And according to your days, so shall your leisurely walk be.
05重 33:26 "There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Who rides the heavens to your help, And through the skies in His majesty.
05重 33:27 "The eternal God is a dwelling place, And underneath are the everlasting arms; And He drove out the enemy from before you, And said, 'Destroy!'
05重 33:28 "So Israel dwells in security, The fountain of Jacob secluded, In a land of grain and new wine; His heavens also drop down dew.
05重 33:29 "Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help, And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies shall cringe before you, And you shall tread upon their high places."
05重 34:1 Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,
05重 34:2 and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
05重 34:3 and the Negev and the plain in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
05重 34:4 Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants'; I have let you see [it] with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."
05重 34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
05重 34:6 And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this day.
05重 34:7 Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated.
05重 34:8 So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping [and] mourning for Moses came to an end.
05重 34:9 Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
05重 34:10 Since then no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
05重 34:11 for all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land,
05重 34:12 and for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
06
06呪 1:1 Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
06呪 1:2 "Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
06呪 1:3 "Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses.
06呪 1:4 "From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun, will be your territory.
06呪 1:5 "No man will [be able to] stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.
06呪 1:6 "Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
06呪 1:7 "Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.
06呪 1:8 "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.
06呪 1:9 "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
06呪 1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
06呪 1:11 "Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ' Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, to possess it. '"
06呪 1:12 And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
06呪 1:13 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, 'The LORD your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.'
06呪 1:14 "Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them,
06呪 1:15 until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as [He gives] you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land, and possess that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise. "
06呪 1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
06呪 1:17 "Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.
06呪 1:18 "Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous."
06呪 2:1 Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there.
06呪 2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, "Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land."
06呪 2:3 And the king of Jericho sent [word] to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land."
06呪 2:4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, " Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
06呪 2:5 "And it came about when [it was time] to shut the gate, at dark, that the men went out; I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them."
06呪 2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.
06呪 2:7 So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate.
06呪 2:8 Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,
06呪 2:9 and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you.
06呪 2:10 "For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
06呪 2:11 "And when we heard [it,] our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.
06呪 2:12 "Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father's household, and give me a pledge of truth,
06呪 2:13 and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, with all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death. "
06呪 2:14 So the men said to her, "Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it shall come about when the LORD gives us the land that we will deal kindly and faithfully with you."
06呪 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall.
06呪 2:16 And she said to them, "Go to the hill country, lest the pursuers happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days, until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way."
06呪 2:17 And the men said to her, "We [shall be] free from this oath to you which you have made us swear,
06呪 2:18 unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father's household.
06呪 2:19 "And it shall come about that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood [shall be] on his own head, and we [shall be] free; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head, if a hand is [laid] on him.
06呪 2:20 "But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear."
06呪 2:21 And she said, "According to your words, so be it." So she sent them away, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
06呪 2:22 And they departed and came to the hill country, and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. Now the pursuers had sought [them] all along the road, but had not found [them.]
06呪 2:23 Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they related to him all that had happened to them.
06呪 2:24 And they said to Joshua, "Surely the LORD has given all the land into our hands, and all the inhabitants of the land, moreover, have melted away before us."
06呪 3:1 Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed.
06呪 3:2 And it came about at the end of three days that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
06呪 3:3 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.
06呪 3:4 "However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 20000 cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before."
06呪 3:5 Then Joshua said to the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."
06呪 3:6 And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.
06呪 3:7 Now the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.
06呪 3:8 "You shall, moreover, command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand [still] in the Jordan.'"
06呪 3:9 Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God."
06呪 3:10 And Joshua said, "By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
06呪 3:11 "Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan.
06呪 3:12 "Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
06呪 3:13 "And it shall come about when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, [and] the waters which are flowing down from above shall stand in one heap."
06呪 3:14 So it came about when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people,
06呪 3:15 and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),
06呪 3:16 that the waters which were flowing down from above stood [and] rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.
06呪 3:17 And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
06呪 4:1 Now it came about when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
06呪 4:2 "Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,
06呪 4:3 and command them, saying, 'Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.' "
06呪 4:4 So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe;
06呪 4:5 and Joshua said to them, "Cross again to the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
06呪 4:6 "Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, 'What do these stones mean to you?'
06呪 4:7 then you shall say to them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever. "
06呪 4:8 And thus the sons of Israel did, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging place, and put them down there.
06呪 4:9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day.
06呪 4:10 For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the LORD had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed;
06呪 4:11 and it came about when all the people had finished crossing, that the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed before the people.
06呪 4:12 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them;
06呪 4:13 about 400000, equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho.
06呪 4:14 On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; so that they revered him, just as they had revered Moses all the days of his life.
06呪 4:15 Now the LORD said to Joshua,
06呪 4:16 "Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan."
06呪 4:17 So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come up from the Jordan."
06呪 4:18 And it came about when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went over all its banks as before.
06呪 4:19 Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho.
06呪 4:20 And those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
06呪 4:21 And he said to the sons of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What are these stones?'
06呪 4:22 then you shall inform your children, saying, 'Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.'
06呪 4:23 "For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as the LORD your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed;
06呪 4:24 that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, so that you may fear the LORD your God forever. "
06呪 5:1 Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who [were] beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who [were] by the sea, heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer, because of the sons of Israel.
06呪 5:2 At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time."
06呪 5:3 So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
06呪 5:4 And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt.
06呪 5:5 For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
06呪 5:6 For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, [that is,] the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06呪 5:7 And their children whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them along the way.
06呪 5:8 Now it came about when they had finished circumcising all the nation, that they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
06呪 5:9 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.
06呪 5:10 While the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal, they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.
06呪 5:11 And on the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched [grain].
06呪 5:12 And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of the land of Canaan during that year.
06呪 5:13 Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us or for our adversaries?"
06呪 5:14 And he said, "No, rather I indeed come now [as] captain of the host of the LORD." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, "What has my lord to say to his servant?"
06呪 5:15 And the captain of the Lord's host said to Joshua, "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
06呪 6:1 Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out and no one came in.
06呪 6:2 And the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king [and] the valiant warriors.
06呪 6:3 "And you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days.
06呪 6:4 "Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
06呪 6:5 "And it shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people will go up every man straight ahead."
06呪 6:6 So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
06呪 6:7 Then he said to the people, "Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of the LORD."
06呪 6:8 And it was [so,] that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
06呪 6:9 And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets.
06呪 6:10 But Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, 'Shout!' Then you shall shout!"
06呪 6:11 So he had the ark of the LORD taken around the city, circling [it] once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.
06呪 6:12 Now Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
06呪 6:13 And the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while they continued to blow the trumpets.
06呪 6:14 Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days.
06呪 6:15 Then it came about on the seventh day that they rose early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.
06呪 6:16 And it came about at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city.
06呪 6:17 "And the city shall be under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to the LORD; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
06呪 6:18 "But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things under the ban, lest you covet [them] and take some of the things under the ban, so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and bring trouble on it.
06呪 6:19 "But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."
06呪 6:20 So the people shouted, and [priests] blew the trumpets; and it came about, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city.
06呪 6:21 And they utterly destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
06呪 6:22 And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the harlot's house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her."
06呪 6:23 So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives, and placed them outside the camp of Israel.
06呪 6:24 And they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
06呪 6:25 However, Rahab the harlot and her father's household and all she had, Joshua spared; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
06呪 6:26 Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with [the loss of] his first-born he shall lay its foundation, and with [the loss of] his youngest son he shall set up its gates."
06呪 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
06呪 7:1 But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel.
06呪 7:2 Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." So the men went up and spied out Ai.
06呪 7:3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, "Do not let all the people go up; [only] about two or three thousand men need go up to Ai; do not make all the people toil up there, for they are few."
06呪 7:4 So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai.
06呪 7:5 And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men, and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water.
06呪 7:6 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, [both] he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.
06呪 7:7 And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why didst Thou ever bring this people over the Jordan, [only] to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan!
06呪 7:8 "O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned [their] back before their enemies?
06呪 7:9 "For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what wilt Thou do for Thy great name?"
06呪 7:10 So the LORD said to Joshua, "Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face?
06呪 7:11 "Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things under the ban and have both stolen and deceived. Moreover, they have also put [them] among their own things.
06呪 7:12 "Therefore the sons of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn [their] backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from your midst.
06呪 7:13 "Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus the LORD, the God of Israel, has said," There are things under the ban in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you have removed the things under the ban from your midst. "
06呪 7:14 'In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD takes [by lot] shall come near by families, and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households, and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
06呪 7:15 'And it shall be that the one who is taken with the things under the ban shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.' "
06呪 7:16 So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
06呪 7:17 And he brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
06呪 7:18 And he brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken.
06呪 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me."
06呪 7:20 So Achan answered Joshua and said, "Truly, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I did
06呪 7:21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it. "
06呪 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it.
06呪 7:23 And they took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before the LORD.
06呪 7:24 Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
06呪 7:25 And Joshua said, "Why have you troubled us? The LORD will trouble you this day." And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.
06呪 7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day.
06呪 8:1 Now the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
06呪 8:2 "And you shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."
06呪 8:3 So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 300000 men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night.
06呪 8:4 And he commanded them, saying, "See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.
06呪 8:5 "Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And it will come about when they come out to meet us as at the first, that we will flee before them.
06呪 8:6 "And they will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, '[They] are fleeing before us as at the first.' So we will flee before them.
06呪 8:7 "And you shall rise from [your] ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
06呪 8:8 "Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do [it] according to the word of the LORD. See, I have commanded you."
06呪 8:9 So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.
06呪 8:10 Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai.
06呪 8:11 Then all the people of war who [were] with him went up and drew near and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now [there was] a valley between him and Ai.
06呪 8:12 And he took about 50000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
06呪 8:13 So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the midst of the valley.
06呪 8:14 And it came about when the king of Ai saw [it,] that the men of the city hurried and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that [there was] an ambush against him behind the city.
06呪 8:15 And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
06呪 8:16 And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
06呪 8:17 So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they left the city unguarded and pursued Israel.
06呪 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand." So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
06呪 8:19 And the [men in] ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it; and they quickly set the city on fire.
06呪 8:20 When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers.
06呪 8:21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the [men in] ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and slew the men of Ai.
06呪 8:22 And the others came out from the city to encounter them, so that they were [trapped] in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they slew them until no one was left of those who survived or escaped.
06呪 8:23 But they took alive the king of Ai and brought him to Joshua.
06呪 8:24 Now it came about when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them were fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.
06呪 8:25 And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 120000-- all the people of Ai.
06呪 8:26 For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
06呪 8:27 Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua.
06呪 8:28 So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day.
06呪 8:29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave command and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raised over it a great heap of stones [that stands] to this day.
06呪 8:30 Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,
06呪 8:31 just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had wielded an iron [tool;] and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
06呪 8:32 And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel.
06呪 8:33 And all Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the stranger as well as the native. Half of them [stood] in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had given command at first to bless the people of Israel.
06呪 8:34 Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
06呪 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers who were living among them.
06呪 9:1 Now it came about when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it,
06呪 9:2 that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
06呪 9:3 When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
06呪 9:4 they also acted craftily and set out as envoys, and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,
06呪 9:5 and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry [and] had become crumbled.
06呪 9:6 And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us."
06呪 9:7 And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we make a covenant with you?"
06呪 9:8 But they said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Then Joshua said to them, "Who are you, and where do you come from?"
06呪 9:9 And they said to him, "Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of the LORD your God; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt,
06呪 9:10 and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth.
06呪 9:11 "So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them," We are your servants; now then, make a covenant with us. "'
06呪 9:12 "This our bread [was] warm [when] we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you; but now behold, it is dry and has become crumbled.
06呪 9:13 "And these wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey."
06呪 9:14 So the men [of Israel] took some of their provisions, and did not ask for the counsel of the LORD.
06呪 9:15 And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore [an oath] to them.
06呪 9:16 And it came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were neighbors and that they were living within their land.
06呪 9:17 Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.
06呪 9:18 And the sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
06呪 9:19 But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
06呪 9:20 "This we will do to them, even let them live, lest wrath be upon us for the oath which we swore to them."
06呪 9:21 And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.
06呪 9:22 Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you are living within our land?
06呪 9:23 "Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall never cease being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
06呪 9:24 So they answered Joshua and said, "Because it was certainly told your servants that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
06呪 9:25 "And now behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us."
06呪 9:26 Thus he did to them, and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.
06呪 9:27 But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place which He would choose.
06呪 10:1 Now it came about when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land,
06呪 10:2 that he feared greatly, because Gibeon [was] a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men [were] mighty.
06呪 10:3 Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent [word] to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
06呪 10:4 "Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel."
06呪 10:5 So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon and fought against it.
06呪 10:6 Then the men of Gibeon sent [word] to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, "Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us."
06呪 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors.
06呪 10:8 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; not one of them shall stand before you."
06呪 10:9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching all night from Gilgal.
06呪 10:10 And the LORD confounded them before Israel, and He slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
06呪 10:11 And it came about as they fled from before Israel, [while] they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the LORD threw large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; [there were] more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
06呪 10:12 Then Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, "O sun, stand still at Gibeon, And O moon in the valley of Aijalon."
06呪 10:13 So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky, and did not hasten to go [down] for about a whole day.
06呪 10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.
06呪 10:15 Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal.
06呪 10:16 Now these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
06呪 10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, "The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
06呪 10:18 And Joshua said, "Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them,
06呪 10:19 but do not stay [there] yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand. "
06呪 10:20 And it came about when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were destroyed, and the survivors [who] remained of them had entered the fortified cities,
06呪 10:21 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a word against any of the sons of Israel.
06呪 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave."
06呪 10:23 And they did so, and brought these five kings out to him from the cave the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, [and] the king of Eglon.
06呪 10:24 And it came about when they brought these kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
06呪 10:25 Joshua then said to them, "Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies with whom you fight."
06呪 10:26 So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening.
06呪 10:27 And it came about at sunset that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
06呪 10:28 Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06呪 10:29 Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
06呪 10:30 And the LORD gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel, and he struck it and every person who [was] in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it. Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06呪 10:31 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it.
06呪 10:32 And the LORD gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and struck it and every person who [was] in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
06呪 10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua defeated him and his people until he had left him no survivor.
06呪 10:34 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it.
06呪 10:35 And they captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and he utterly destroyed that day every person who [was] in it, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
06呪 10:36 Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it.
06呪 10:37 And they captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who [were] in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he utterly destroyed it and every person who [was] in it.
06呪 10:38 Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it.
06呪 10:39 And he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person [ who was] in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king.
06呪 10:40 Thus Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
06呪 10:41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon.
06呪 10:42 And Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
06呪 10:43 So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
06呪 11:1 Then it came about, when Jabin king of Hazor heard [of it,] that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph,
06呪 11:2 and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country, and in the Arabah-- south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and on the heights of Dor on the west--
06呪 11:3 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
06呪 11:4 And they came out, they and all their armies with them, [as] many people [as] the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
06呪 11:5 So all of these kings having agreed to meet, came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
06呪 11:6 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."
06呪 11:7 So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.
06呪 11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, so that they defeated them, and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they struck them until no survivor was left to them.
06呪 11:9 And Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
06呪 11:10 Then Joshua turned back at that time, and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.
06呪 11:11 And they struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them;] there was no one left who breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
06呪 11:12 And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, [and] utterly destroyed them; just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
06呪 11:13 However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, [which] Joshua burned.
06呪 11:14 And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one who breathed.
06呪 11:15 Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
06呪 11:16 Thus Joshua took all that land the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland
06呪 11:17 from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death.
06呪 11:18 Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.
06呪 11:19 There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle.
06呪 11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to meet Israel in battle in order that he might utterly destroy them, that they might receive no mercy, but that he might destroy them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06呪 11:21 Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
06呪 11:22 There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained.
06呪 11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.
06呪 12:1 Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east
06呪 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, [and] ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, even as far as the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;
06呪 12:3 and the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, [even] the Salt Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah;
06呪 12:4 and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
06呪 12:5 and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, [as far as] the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
06呪 12:6 Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh as a possession.
06呪 12:7 Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,
06呪 12:8 in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Arabah, on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite
06呪 12:9 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
06呪 12:10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
06呪 12:11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
06呪 12:12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
06呪 12:13 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
06呪 12:14 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
06呪 12:15 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
06呪 12:16 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
06呪 12:17 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
06呪 12:18 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
06呪 12:19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
06呪 12:20 the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
06呪 12:21 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
06呪 12:22 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
06呪 12:23 the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
06呪 12:24 the king of Tirzah, one in all, thirty-one kings.
06呪 13:1 Now Joshua was old [and] advanced in years when the LORD said to him, "You are old [and] advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed.
06呪 13:2 "This is the land that remains all the regions [of] the Philistines and all [those of] the Geshurites;
06呪 13:3 from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite
06呪 13:4 to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite;
06呪 13:5 and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
06呪 13:6 "All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you.
06呪 13:7 "Now therefore, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
06呪 13:8 With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them;
06呪 13:9 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon;
06呪 13:10 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon;
06呪 13:11 and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah;
06呪 13:12 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them.
06呪 13:13 But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day.
06呪 13:14 Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He spoke to him.
06呪 13:15 So Moses gave [an inheritance] to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
06呪 13:16 And their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba;
06呪 13:17 Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon,
06呪 13:18 and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath,
06呪 13:19 and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
06呪 13:20 and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth,
06呪 13:21 even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
06呪 13:22 The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among [the rest of] their slain.
06呪 13:23 And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.
06呪 13:24 Moses also gave [an inheritance] to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families.
06呪 13:25 And their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah;
06呪 13:26 and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir;
06呪 13:27 and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the [lower] end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east.
06呪 13:28 This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.
06呪 13:29 Moses also gave [an inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
06呪 13:30 And their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
06呪 13:31 also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, [were] for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families.
06呪 13:32 These are [the territories] which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east.
06呪 13:33 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised to them.
06呪 14:1 Now these are [the territories] which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance,
06呪 14:2 by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.
06呪 14:3 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them.
06呪 14:4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property.
06呪 14:5 Thus the sons of Israel did just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
06呪 14:6 Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know the word which the LORD spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea.
06呪 14:7 "I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as [it was] in my heart.
06呪 14:8 "Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God fully.
06呪 14:9 "So Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God fully.'
06呪 14:10 "And now behold, the LORD has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today.
06呪 14:11 "I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in.
06呪 14:12 "Now then, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim [were] there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out as the LORD has spoken."
06呪 14:13 So Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
06呪 14:14 Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day, because he followed the LORD God of Israel fully.
06呪 14:15 Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; [for Arba] was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
06呪 15:1 Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the extreme south.
06呪 15:2 And their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south.
06呪 15:3 Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued to Zin, then went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka.
06呪 15:4 And it continued to Azmon and proceeded to the brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border.
06呪 15:5 And the east border [was] the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan.
06呪 15:6 Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued on the north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
06呪 15:7 And the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh, and it ended at En-rogel.
06呪 15:8 Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north.
06呪 15:9 And from the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
06呪 15:10 And the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah.
06呪 15:11 And the border proceeded to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea.
06呪 15:12 And the west border [was] at the Great Sea, even [its] coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families.
06呪 15:13 Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of the LORD to Joshua, [namely,] Kiriath-arba, [Arba being] the father of Anak (that is, Hebron).
06呪 15:14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak.
06呪 15:15 Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
06呪 15:16 And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife."
06呪 15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife.
06呪 15:18 And it came about that when she came [to him,] she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. So she alighted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
06呪 15:19 Then she said, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
06呪 15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
06呪 15:21 Now the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the border of Edom in the south were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur,
06呪 15:22 and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah,
06呪 15:23 and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan,
06呪 15:24 Ziph and Telem and Bealoth,
06呪 15:25 and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
06呪 15:26 Amam and Shema and Moladah,
06呪 15:27 and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet,
06呪 15:28 and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah,
06呪 15:29 Baalah and Iim and Ezem,
06呪 15:30 and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah,
06呪 15:31 and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah,
06呪 15:32 and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all, twenty-nine cities with their villages.
06呪 15:33 In the lowland Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah,
06呪 15:34 and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam,
06呪 15:35 Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah,
06呪 15:36 and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
06呪 15:37 Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad,
06呪 15:38 and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel,
06呪 15:39 Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon,
06呪 15:40 and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish,
06呪 15:41 and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
06呪 15:42 Libnah and Ether and Ashan,
06呪 15:43 and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib,
06呪 15:44 and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
06呪 15:45 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
06呪 15:46 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
06呪 15:47 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; as far as the brook of Egypt and the Great Sea, even [its] coastline.
06呪 15:48 And in the hill country Shamir and Jattir and Socoh,
06呪 15:49 and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
06呪 15:50 and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim,
06呪 15:51 and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
06呪 15:52 Arab and Dumah and Eshan,
06呪 15:53 and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah,
06呪 15:54 and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
06呪 15:55 Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah,
06呪 15:56 and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah,
06呪 15:57 Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
06呪 15:58 Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor,
06呪 15:59 and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
06呪 15:60 Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
06呪 15:61 In the wilderness Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah,
06呪 15:62 and Nibshan and the City of Salt and Engedi; six cities with their villages.
06呪 15:63 Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day.
06呪 16:1 Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel.
06呪 16:2 And it went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to the border of the Archites at Ataroth.
06呪 16:3 And it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.
06呪 16:4 And the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
06呪 16:5 Now [this] was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon.
06呪 16:6 Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and continued [beyond] it to the east of Janoah.
06呪 16:7 And it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
06呪 16:8 From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families,
06呪 16:9 [together] with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
06呪 16:10 But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers.
06呪 17:1 Now [this] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the first-born of Joseph. To Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, was allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
06呪 17:2 So [the lot] was [made] for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these [were] the male [descendants] of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
06呪 17:3 However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.
06呪 17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So according to the command of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among their father's brothers.
06呪 17:5 Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan,
06呪 17:6 because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
06呪 17:7 And the border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
06呪 17:8 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh [belonged] to the sons of Ephraim.
06呪 17:9 And the border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities [belonged] to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh [was] on the north side of the brook, and it ended at the sea.
06呪 17:10 The south side [belonged] to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east.
06呪 17:11 And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth.
06呪 17:12 But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
06呪 17:13 And it came about when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
06呪 17:14 Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom the LORD has thus far blessed?"
06呪 17:15 And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
06呪 17:16 And the sons of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel."
06呪 17:17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, "You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot [only,]
06呪 17:18 but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron [and] though they are strong. "
06呪 18:1 Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
06呪 18:2 And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance.
06呪 18:3 So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, "How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
06呪 18:4 "Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me.
06呪 18:5 "And they shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north.
06呪 18:6 "And you shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring [the description] here to me. And I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
06呪 18:7 "For the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
06呪 18:8 Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, "Go and walk through the land and describe it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh."
06呪 18:9 So the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
06呪 18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.
06呪 18:11 Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
06呪 18:12 And their border on the north side was from the Jordan, then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward; and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
06呪 18:13 And from there the border continued to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which [lies] on the south of lower Beth-horon.
06呪 18:14 And the border extended [from there,] and turned round on the west side southward, from the hill which [lies] before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This [was] the west side.
06呪 18:15 Then the south side [was] from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went westward and went to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah.
06呪 18:16 And the border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel.
06呪 18:17 And it extended northward and went to En-shemesh and went to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
06呪 18:18 And it continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.
06呪 18:19 And the border continued to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This [was] the south border.
06呪 18:20 Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This [was] the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families [and] according to its borders all around.
06呪 18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz,
06呪 18:22 and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel,
06呪 18:23 and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah,
06呪 18:24 and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages.
06呪 18:25 Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth,
06呪 18:26 and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah,
06呪 18:27 and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah,
06呪 18:28 and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.
06呪 19:1 Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah.
06呪 19:2 So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah,
06呪 19:3 and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem,
06呪 19:4 and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah,
06呪 19:5 and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah,
06呪 19:6 and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen, thirteen cities with their villages;
06呪 19:7 Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan, four cities with their villages;
06呪 19:8 and all the villages which [were] around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This [was] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families.
06呪 19:9 The inheritance of the sons of Simeon [was taken] from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received [an] inheritance in the midst of Judah's inheritance.
06呪 19:10 Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
06呪 19:11 Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah, it then touched Dabbesheth, and reached to the brook that is before Jokneam.
06呪 19:12 Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and up to Japhia.
06呪 19:13 And from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it proceeded to Rimmon which stretches to Neah.
06呪 19:14 And the border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel.
06呪 19:15 [Included] also [were] Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages.
06呪 19:16 This [was] the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
06呪 19:17 The fourth lot fell to Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families.
06呪 19:18 And their territory was to Jezreel and [included] Chesulloth and Shunem,
06呪 19:19 and Hapharaim and Shion and Anaharath,
06呪 19:20 and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez,
06呪 19:21 and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez.
06呪 19:22 And the border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages.
06呪 19:23 This [was] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
06呪 19:24 Now the fifth lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families.
06呪 19:25 And their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph,
06呪 19:26 and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath.
06呪 19:27 And it turned toward the east to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it proceeded on north to Cabul,
06呪 19:28 and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.
06呪 19:29 And the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib.
06呪 19:30 [Included] also [were] Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages.
06呪 19:31 This [was] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
06呪 19:32 The sixth lot fell to the sons of Naphtali; to the sons of Naphtali according to their families.
06呪 19:33 And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; and it ended at the Jordan.
06呪 19:34 Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and proceeded from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and touched Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east.
06呪 19:35 And the fortified cities [were] Ziddim, Zer and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth,
06呪 19:36 and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor,
06呪 19:37 and Kedesh and Edrei and En-hazor,
06呪 19:38 and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
06呪 19:39 This [was] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
06呪 19:40 The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families.
06呪 19:41 And the territory of their inheritance was Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh,
06呪 19:42 and Shaalabbin and Aijalon and Ithlah,
06呪 19:43 and Elon and Timnah and Ekron,
06呪 19:44 and Eltekeh and Gibbethon and Baalath,
06呪 19:45 and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon,
06呪 19:46 and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory over against Joppa.
06呪 19:47 And the territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father.
06呪 19:48 This [was] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
06呪 19:49 When they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun.
06呪 19:50 In accordance with the command of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it.
06呪 19:51 These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
06呪 20:1 Then the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
06呪 20:2 "Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
06呪 20:3 that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from the avenger of blood.
06呪 20:4 'And he shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and state his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may dwell among them.
06呪 20:5 'Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand.
06呪 20:6 'And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.' "
06呪 20:7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06呪 20:8 And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
06呪 20:9 These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation.
06呪 21:1 Then the heads of households of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
06呪 21:2 And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, "The LORD commanded through Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle."
06呪 21:3 So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of the LORD.
06呪 21:4 Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin.
06呪 21:5 And the rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06呪 21:6 And the sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06呪 21:7 The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
06呪 21:8 Now the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06呪 21:9 And they gave these cities which are [here] mentioned by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon;
06呪 21:10 and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first.
06呪 21:11 Thus they gave them Kiriath-arba, [Arba being] the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasture lands.
06呪 21:12 But the fields of the city and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06呪 21:13 So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:14 and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:15 and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:16 and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands [ and] Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands; nine cities from these two tribes.
06呪 21:17 And from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:18 Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:19 All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:20 Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, [even to] the rest of the sons of Kohath.
06呪 21:21 And they gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:22 and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:23 And from the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:24 Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:25 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh, [they allotted] Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; two cities.
06呪 21:26 All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten.
06呪 21:27 And to the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, [they gave] Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities.
06呪 21:28 And from the tribe of Issachar, [they gave] Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:29 Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:30 And from the tribe of Asher, [they gave] Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:31 Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:32 And from the tribe of Naphtali, [they gave] Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands; three cities.
06呪 21:33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:34 And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, [they gave] from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands.
06呪 21:35 Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:36 And from the tribe of Reuben, [they gave] Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:37 Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities.
06呪 21:38 And from the tribe of Gad, [they gave] Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Mahanaim with its pasture lands,
06呪 21:39 Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all.
06呪 21:40 All [these were] the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
06呪 21:41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.
06呪 21:42 These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus [it was] with all these cities.
06呪 21:43 So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it.
06呪 21:44 And the LORD gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and no one of all their enemies stood before them; the LORD gave all their enemies into their hand.
06呪 21:45 Not one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.
06呪 22:1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
06呪 22:2 and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you.
06呪 22:3 "You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
06呪 22:4 "And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them; therefore turn now and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan.
06呪 22:5 "Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul."
06呪 22:6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
06呪 22:7 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [a possession] in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave [a possession] among their brothers westward beyond the Jordan. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
06呪 22:8 and said to them, "Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers."
06呪 22:9 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned [home] and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they had possessed, according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
06呪 22:10 And when they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance.
06呪 22:11 And the sons of Israel heard [it] said, "Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side [belonging to] the sons of Israel."
06呪 22:12 And when the sons of Israel heard [of it,] the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves at Shiloh, to go up against them in war.
06呪 22:13 Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
06呪 22:14 and with him ten chiefs, one chief for each father's household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them [was] the head of his father's household among the thousands of Israel.
06呪 22:15 And they came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying,
06呪 22:16 "Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, 'What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away from following the LORD this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day?
06呪 22:17 'Is not the iniquity of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although a plague came on the congregation of the LORD,
06呪 22:18 that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And it will come about if you rebel against the LORD today, that He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.
06呪 22:19 'If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the LORD, where the Lord's tabernacle stands, and take possession among us. Only do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of the LORD our God.
06呪 22:20 'Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.' "
06呪 22:21 Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel.
06呪 22:22 "The Mighty One, God, the LORD, the Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If [it was] in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against the LORD do not Thou save us this day!
06呪 22:23 "If we have built us an altar to turn away from following the LORD, or if to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it.
06呪 22:24 "But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ' In time to come your sons may say to our sons," What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
06呪 22:25 "For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, [ you] sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in the LORD." So your sons may make our sons stop fearing the LORD. '
06呪 22:26 "Therefore we said, 'Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice;
06呪 22:27 rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD." '
06呪 22:28 "Therefore we said, 'It shall also come about if they say [this] to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say," See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather it is a witness between us and you. "'
06呪 22:29 "Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away from following the LORD this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle."
06呪 22:30 So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the families of Israel who [were] with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
06呪 22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is in our midst, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD; now you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the LORD."
06呪 22:32 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them.
06呪 22:33 And the word pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living.
06呪 22:34 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar [Witness;] "For," [they said,] "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
06呪 23:1 Now it came about after many days, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years,
06呪 23:2 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, "I am old, advanced in years.
06呪 23:3 "And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is He who has been fighting for you.
06呪 23:4 "See, I have apportioned to you these nations which remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan even to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun.
06呪 23:5 "And the LORD your God, He shall thrust them out from before you and drive them from before you; and you shall possess their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
06呪 23:6 "Be very firm, then, to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,
06呪 23:7 in order that you may not associate with these nations, these which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make [anyone] swear [by them,] or serve them, or bow down to them.
06呪 23:8 "But you are to cling to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
06呪 23:9 "For the LORD has driven out great and strong nations from before you; and as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.
06呪 23:10 "One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you.
06呪 23:11 "So take diligent heed to yourselves to love the LORD your God.
06呪 23:12 "For if you ever go back and cling to the rest of these nations, these which remain among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
06呪 23:13 know with certainty that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out from before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
06呪 23:14 "Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the LORD your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed.
06呪 23:15 "And it shall come about that just as all the good words which the LORD your God spoke to you have come upon you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the threats, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
06呪 23:16 "When you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you."
06呪 24:1 Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
06呪 24:2 And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the River, [namely,] Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
06呪 24:3 'Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac.
06呪 24:4 'And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
06呪 24:5 'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out.
06呪 24:6 'And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
06呪 24:7 'But when they cried out to the LORD, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
06呪 24:8 'Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you.
06呪 24:9 'Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
06呪 24:10 'But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his hand.
06呪 24:11 'And you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, [and] the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. Thus I gave them into your hand.
06呪 24:12 'Then I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, [but] not by your sword or your bow.
06呪 24:13 'And I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.'
06呪 24:14 "Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
06呪 24:15 "And if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
06呪 24:16 And the people answered and said, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods;
06呪 24:17 for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs in our sight and preserved us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed.
06呪 24:18 "And the LORD drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God."
06呪 24:19 Then Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression or your sins.
06呪 24:20 "If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after He has done good to you."
06呪 24:21 And the people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the LORD."
06呪 24:22 And Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him." And they said, "We are witnesses."
06呪 24:23 "Now therefore, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06呪 24:24 And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and we will obey His voice."
06呪 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
06呪 24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
06呪 24:27 And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; thus it shall be for a witness against you, lest you deny your God."
06呪 24:28 Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance.
06呪 24:29 And it came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
06呪 24:30 And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.
06呪 24:31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, and had known all the deeds of the LORD which He had done for Israel.
06呪 24:32 Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph's sons.
06呪 24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.
07
07資 1:1 Now it came about after the death of Joshua that the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"
07資 1:2 And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand."
07資 1:3 Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I in turn will go with you into the territory allotted you." So Simeon went with him.
07資 1:4 And Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands; and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.
07資 1:5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
07資 1:6 But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07資 1:7 And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to gather up [scraps] under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me." So they brought him to Jerusalem and he died there.
07資 1:8 Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
07資 1:9 And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country and in the Negev and in the lowland.
07資 1:10 So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron formerly [was] Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
07資 1:11 Then from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (now the name of Debir formerly [was] Kiriath-sepher).
07資 1:12 And Caleb said, "The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah for a wife."
07資 1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for a wife.
07資 1:14 Then it came about when she came [to him,] that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. Then she alighted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?"
07資 1:15 And she said to him, "Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
07資 1:16 And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
07資 1:17 Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
07資 1:18 And Judah took Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory.
07資 1:19 Now the LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots.
07資 1:20 Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had promised; and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.
07資 1:21 But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
07資 1:22 Likewise the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
07資 1:23 And the house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz).
07資 1:24 And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly."
07資 1:25 So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free.
07資 1:26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz which is its name to this day.
07資 1:27 But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
07資 1:28 And it came about when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.
07資 1:29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
07資 1:30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor.
07資 1:31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob.
07資 1:32 So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
07資 1:33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.
07資 1:34 Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley;
07資 1:35 yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house of Joseph grew strong, they became forced labor.
07資 1:36 And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
07資 2:1 Now the angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have sworn to your fathers; and I said, 'I will never break My covenant with you,
07資 2:2 and as for you, you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars. 'But you have not obeyed Me; what is this you have done?
07資 2:3 "Therefore I also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.'"
07資 2:4 And it came about when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.
07資 2:5 So they named that place Bochim; and there they sacrificed to the LORD.
07資 2:6 When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went each to his inheritance to possess the land.
07資 2:7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel.
07資 2:8 Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten.
07資 2:9 And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
07資 2:10 And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD, nor yet the work which He had done for Israel.
07資 2:11 Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served the Baals,
07資 2:12 and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods from [among] the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; thus they provoked the LORD to anger.
07資 2:13 So they forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
07資 2:14 And the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies around [them,] so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
07資 2:15 Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had spoken and as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.
07資 2:16 Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them.
07資 2:17 And yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do as [their fathers].
07資 2:18 And when the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them.
07資 2:19 But it came about when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways.
07資 2:20 So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, "Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice,
07資 2:21 I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,
07資 2:22 in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it as their fathers did, or not. "
07資 2:23 So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
07資 3:1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them ([that is,] all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan;
07資 3:2 only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, those who had not experienced it formerly).
07資 3:3 [These nations are:] the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
07資 3:4 And they were for testing Israel, to find out if they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers through Moses.
07資 3:5 And the sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
07資 3:6 and they took their daughters for themselves as wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
07資 3:7 And the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
07資 3:8 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, so that He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
07資 3:9 And when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
07資 3:10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
07資 3:11 Then the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
07資 3:12 Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD .
07資 3:13 And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and defeated Israel, and they possessed the city of the palm trees.
07資 3:14 And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
07資 3:15 But when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
07資 3:16 And Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he bound it on his right thigh under his cloak.
07資 3:17 And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
07資 3:18 And it came about when he had finished presenting the tribute, that he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.
07資 3:19 But he himself turned back from the idols which were at Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he said, "Keep silence." And all who attended him left him.
07資 3:20 And Ehud came to him while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.
07資 3:21 And Ehud stretched out his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly.
07資 3:22 The handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out.
07資 3:23 Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the roof chamber behind him, and locked [them].
07資 3:24 When he had gone out, his servants came and looked, and behold, the doors of the roof chamber were locked; and they said, "He is only relieving himself in the cool room."
07資 3:25 And they waited until they became anxious; but behold, he did not open the doors of the roof chamber. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor dead.
07資 3:26 Now Ehud escaped while they were delaying, and he passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.
07資 3:27 And it came about when he had arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he [was] in front of them.
07資 3:28 And he said to them, "Pursue [them], for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hands." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross.
07資 3:29 And they struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; and no one escaped.
07資 3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land was undisturbed for eighty years.
07資 3:31 And after him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad; and he also saved Israel.
07資 4:1 Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died.
07資 4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
07資 4:3 And the sons of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for twenty years.
07資 4:4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
07資 4:5 And she used to sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
07資 4:6 Now she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, "Behold, the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded, 'Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun.
07資 4:7 'And I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his many [troops] to the river Kishon; and I will give him into your hand.' "
07資 4:8 Then Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
07資 4:9 And she said, "I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the honor shall not be yours on the journey that you are about to take, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
07資 4:10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also went up with him.
07資 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
07資 4:12 Then they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
07資 4:13 And Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who [were] with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.
07資 4:14 And Deborah said to Barak, "Arise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hands; behold, the LORD has gone out before you." So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
07資 4:15 And the LORD routed Sisera and all [his] chariots and all [his] army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from [his] chariot and fled away on foot.
07資 4:16 But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left.
07資 4:17 Now Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
07資 4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, "Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid." And he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
07資 4:19 And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a bottle of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him.
07資 4:20 And he said to her, "Stand in the doorway of the tent, and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there anyone here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"
07資 4:21 But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and seized a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died.
07資 4:22 And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." And he entered with her, and behold Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.
07資 4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.
07資 4:24 And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan.
07資 5:1 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
07資 5:2 "That the leaders led in Israel, That the people volunteered, Bless the LORD!
07資 5:3 "Hear, O kings; give ear, O rulers! I-- to the LORD, I will sing, I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
07資 5:4 "LORD, when Thou didst go out from Seir, When Thou didst march from the field of Edom, The earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, Even the clouds dripped water.
07資 5:5 "The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, This Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
07資 5:6 "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, And travelers went by roundabout ways.
07資 5:7 "The peasantry ceased, they ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Until I arose, a mother in Israel.
07資 5:8 "New gods were chosen; Then war [was] in the gates. Not a shield or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel.
07資 5:9 "My heart [goes out] to the commanders of Israel, The volunteers among the people; Bless the LORD!
07資 5:10 "You who ride on white donkeys, You who sit on [rich] carpets, And you who travel on the road-- sing!
07資 5:11 "At the sound of those who divide [flocks] among the watering places, There they shall recount the righteous deeds of the LORD, The righteous deeds for His peasantry in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates.
07資 5:12 "Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and take away your captives, O son of Abinoam.
07資 5:13 "Then survivors came down to the nobles; The people of the LORD came down to me as warriors.
07資 5:14 "From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek [came down,] Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; From Machir commanders came down, And from Zebulun those who wield the staff of office.
07資 5:15 "And the princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; As [was] Issachar, so [was] Barak; Into the valley they rushed at his heels; Among the divisions of Reuben [There were] great resolves of heart.
07資 5:16 "Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the piping for the flocks? Among the divisions of Reuben [There were] great searchings of heart.
07資 5:17 "Gilead remained across the Jordan; And why did Dan stay in ships? Asher sat at the seashore, And remained by its landings.
07資 5:18 "Zebulun [was] a people who despised their lives [even] to death, And Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
07資 5:19 "The kings came [and] fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan At Taanach near the waters of Megiddo; They took no plunder in silver.
07資 5:20 "The stars fought from heaven, From their courses they fought against Sisera.
07資 5:21 "The torrent of Kishon swept them away, The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.
07資 5:22 "Then the horses' hoofs beat From the dashing, the dashing of his valiant steeds.
07資 5:23 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD, 'Utterly curse its inhabitants; Because they did not come to the help of the LORD, To the help of the LORD against the warriors.'
07資 5:24 "Most blessed of women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Most blessed is she of women in the tent.
07資 5:25 "He asked for water [and] she gave him milk; In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.
07資 5:26 "She reached out her hand for the tent peg, And her right hand for the workmen's hammer. Then she struck Sisera, she smashed his head; And she shattered and pierced his temple.
07資 5:27 "Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell dead.
07資 5:28 "Out of the window she looked and lamented, The mother of Sisera through the lattice, 'Why does his chariot delay in coming? Why do the hoofbeats of his chariots tarry?'
07資 5:29 "Her wise princesses would answer her, Indeed she repeats her words to herself,
07資 5:30 'Are they not finding, are they not dividing the spoil? A maiden, two maidens for every warrior; To Sisera a spoil of dyed work, A spoil of dyed work embroidered, Dyed work of double embroidery on the neck of the spoiler?'
07資 5:31 "Thus let all Thine enemies perish, O LORD; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might." And the land was undisturbed for forty years.
07資 6:1 Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hands of Midian seven years.
07資 6:2 And the power of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
07資 6:3 For it was when Israel had sown, that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the sons of the east and go against them.
07資 6:4 So they would camp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey.
07資 6:5 For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, they would come in like locusts for number, both they and their camels were innumerable; and they came into the land to devastate it.
07資 6:6 So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried to the LORD.
07資 6:7 Now it came about when the sons of Israel cried to the LORD on account of Midian,
07資 6:8 that the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel, and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'It was I who brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out from the house of slavery.
07資 6:9 'And I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians and from the hands of all your oppressors, and dispossessed them before you and gave you their land,
07資 6:10 and I said to you, "I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed Me." '"
07資 6:11 Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press in order to save [it] from the Midianites.
07資 6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O valiant warrior."
07資 6:13 Then Gideon said to him, "O my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."
07資 6:14 And the LORD looked at him and said, "Go in this your strength and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?"
07資 6:15 And he said to Him, "O Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the least in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father's house."
07資 6:16 But the LORD said to him, "Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat Midian as one man."
07資 6:17 So Gideon said to Him, "If now I have found favor in Thy sight, then show me a sign that it is Thou who speakest with me.
07資 6:18 "Please do not depart from here, until I come [back] to Thee, and bring out my offering and lay it before Thee." And He said, "I will remain until you return."
07資 6:19 Then Gideon went in and prepared a kid and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour; he put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought [them] out to him under the oak, and presented [them.]
07資 6:20 And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so.
07資 6:21 Then the angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
07資 6:22 When Gideon saw that he was the angel of the LORD, he said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."
07資 6:23 And the LORD said to him, "Peace to you, do not fear; you shall not die."
07資 6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07資 6:25 Now the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull and a second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it;
07資 6:26 and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold in an orderly manner, and take a second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down. "
07資 6:27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had spoken to him; and it came about, because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, that he did it by night.
07資 6:28 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built.
07資 6:29 And they said to one another, "Who did this thing?" And when they searched about and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Joash did this thing."
07資 6:30 Then the men of the city said to Joash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal, and indeed, he has cut down the Asherah which was beside it."
07資 6:31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, "Will you contend for Baal, or will you deliver him? Whoever will plead for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has torn down his altar."
07資 6:32 Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, that is to say, "Let Baal contend against him," because he had torn down his altar.
07資 6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled themselves; and they crossed over and camped in the valley of Jezreel.
07資 6:34 So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him.
07資 6:35 And he sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and they also were called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
07資 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "If Thou wilt deliver Israel through me, as Thou hast spoken,
07資 6:37 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I will know that Thou wilt deliver Israel through me, as Thou hast spoken. "
07資 6:38 And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he drained the dew from the fleece, a bowl full of water.
07資 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Do not let Thine anger burn against me that I may speak once more; please let me make a test once more with the fleece, let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground."
07資 6:40 And God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and dew was on all the ground.
07資 7:1 Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
07資 7:2 And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, lest Israel become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.'
07資 7:3 "Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ' Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead. '"So 220000 people returned, but 100000 remained.
07資 7:4 Then the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."
07資 7:5 So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, "You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink."
07資 7:6 Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water.
07資 7:7 And the LORD said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the [other] people go, each man to his home."
07資 7:8 So the 300 men took the people's provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the [other] men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300 men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
07資 7:9 Now the same night it came about that the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands.
07資 7:10 "But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp,
07資 7:11 and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp. "So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp.
07資 7:12 Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
07資 7:13 When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, "Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat."
07資 7:14 And his friend answered and said, "This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand."
07資 7:15 And it came about when Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, that he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hands."
07資 7:16 And he divided the 300 men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers.
07資 7:17 And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
07資 7:18 "When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp, and say, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
07資 7:19 So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands.
07資 7:20 When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
07資 7:21 And each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled.
07資 7:22 And when they blew 300 trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
07資 7:23 And the men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
07資 7:24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan." So all the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
07資 7:25 And they captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.
07資 8:1 Then the men of Ephraim said to him, "What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they contended with him vigorously.
07資 8:2 But he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning [of the grapes] of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
07資 8:3 "God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.
07資 8:4 Then Gideon and the 300 men who were with him came to the Jordan [ and] crossed over, weary yet pursuing.
07資 8:5 And he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07資 8:6 And the leaders of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?"
07資 8:7 And Gideon said, "All right, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thrash your bodies with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
07資 8:8 And he went up from there to Penuel, and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered.
07資 8:9 So he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, "When I return safely, I will tear down this tower."
07資 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about 150000 men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for the fallen were 1200000 swordsmen.
07資 8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp, when the camp was unsuspecting.
07資 8:12 When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.
07資 8:13 Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
07資 8:14 And he captured a youth from Succoth and questioned him. Then [the youth] wrote down for him the princes of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.
07資 8:15 And he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?'"
07資 8:16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them.
07資 8:17 And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
07資 8:18 Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men [were] they whom you killed at Tabor?" And they said, "They were like you, each one resembling the son of a king."
07資 8:19 And he said, "They [were] my brothers, the sons of my mother. [As] the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you."
07資 8:20 So he said to Jether his first-born, "Rise, kill them." But the youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
07資 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise up yourself, and fall on us; for as the man, so is his strength." So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments which were on their camels' necks.
07資 8:22 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, both you and your son, also your son's son, for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
07資 8:23 But Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you."
07資 8:24 Yet Gideon said to them, "I would request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his spoil." (For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
07資 8:25 And they said, "We will surely give [them.]" So they spread out a garment, and every one of them threw an earring there from his spoil.
07資 8:26 And the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was 17000 [shekels] of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple robes which [were] on the kings of Midian, and besides the neck bands that [were] on their camels' necks.
07資 8:27 And Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
07資 8:28 So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their heads anymore. And the land was undisturbed for forty years in the days of Gideon.
07資 8:29 Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
07資 8:30 Now Gideon had seventy sons who were his direct descendants, for he had many wives.
07資 8:31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
07資 8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07資 8:33 Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the sons of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god.
07資 8:34 Thus the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side;
07資 8:35 nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal ([that is,] Gideon), in accord with all the good that he had done to Israel.
07資 9:1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's relatives, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother's father, saying,
07資 9:2 "Speak, now, in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?' Also, remember that I am your bone and your flesh."
07資 9:3 And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem; and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative."
07資 9:4 And they gave him seventy [pieces] of silver from the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, and they followed him.
07資 9:5 Then he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
07資 9:6 And all the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem.
07資 9:7 Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and called out. Thus he said to them, "Listen to me, O men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
07資 9:8 "Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us!'
07資 9:9 "But the olive tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my fatness with which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?'
07資 9:10 "Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come, reign over us!'
07資 9:11 "But the fig tree said to them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?'
07資 9:12 "Then the trees said to the vine, 'You come, reign over us!'
07資 9:13 "But the vine said to them, 'Shall I leave my new wine, which cheers God and men, and go to wave over the trees?'
07資 9:14 "Finally all the trees said to the bramble, 'You come, reign over us!'
07資 9:15 "And the bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'
07資 9:16 "Now therefore, if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved--
07資 9:17 for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian;
07資 9:18 but you have risen against my father's house today and have killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your relative--
07資 9:19 if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
07資 9:20 "But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from Beth-millo, and consume Abimelech."
07資 9:21 Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and remained there because of Abimelech his brother.
07資 9:22 Now Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
07資 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
07資 9:24 in order that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
07資 9:25 And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who might pass by them along the road; and it was told to Abimelech.
07資 9:26 Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and crossed over into Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
07資 9:27 And they went out into the field and gathered [the grapes of] their vineyards and trod [them,] and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech.
07資 9:28 Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and [is] Zebul [not] his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
07資 9:29 "Would, therefore, that this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech." And he said to Abimelech, "Increase your army, and come out."
07資 9:30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.
07資 9:31 And he sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and behold, they are stirring up the city against you.
07資 9:32 "Now therefore, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.
07資 9:33 "And it shall come about in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, that you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can."
07資 9:34 So Abimelech and all the people who [were] with him arose by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
07資 9:35 Now Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; and Abimelech and the people who [were] with him arose from the ambush.
07資 9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains." But Zebul said to him, "You are seeing the shadow of the mountains as [if they were] men."
07資 9:37 And Gaal spoke again and said, "Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the diviners' oak."
07資 9:38 Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your boasting now with which you said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!"
07資 9:39 So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
07資 9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate.
07資 9:41 Then Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem.
07資 9:42 Now it came about the next day, that the people went out to the field, and it was told to Abimelech.
07資 9:43 So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; when he looked and saw the people coming out from the city, he arose against them and slew them.
07資 9:44 Then Abimelech and the company who was with him dashed forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the other two companies then dashed against all who [were] in the field and slew them.
07資 9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he captured the city and killed the people who [were] in it; then he razed the city and sowed it with salt.
07資 9:46 When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard of [it,] they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.
07資 9:47 And it was told Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
07資 9:48 So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who [were] with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, and lifted it and laid [it] on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who [were] with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry [and] do likewise."
07資 9:49 And all the people also cut down each one his branch and followed Abimelech, and put [them] on the inner chamber and set the inner chamber on fire over those [inside,] so that all the men of the tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.
07資 9:50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he camped against Thebez and captured it.
07資 9:51 But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower.
07資 9:52 So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.
07資 9:53 But a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, crushing his skull.
07資 9:54 Then he called quickly to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest it be said of me, 'A woman slew him.'" So the young man pierced him through, and he died.
07資 9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home.
07資 9:56 Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father, in killing his seventy brothers.
07資 9:57 Also God returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
07資 10:1 Now after Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
07資 10:2 And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
07資 10:3 And after him, Jair the Gileadite arose, and judged Israel twenty-two years.
07資 10:4 And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair to this day.
07資 10:5 And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
07資 10:6 Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him.
07資 10:7 And the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the sons of Ammon.
07資 10:8 And they afflicted and crushed the sons of Israel that year; for eighteen years they [afflicted] all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in Gilead in the land of the Amorites.
07資 10:9 And the sons of Ammon crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.
07資 10:10 Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against Thee, for indeed, we have forsaken our God and served the Baals."
07資 10:11 And the LORD said to the sons of Israel, "[Did I] not [deliver you] from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines?
07資 10:12 "Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands.
07資 10:13 "Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore I will deliver you no more.
07資 10:14 "Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress."
07資 10:15 And the sons of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned, do to us whatever seems good to Thee; only please deliver us this day."
07資 10:16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the LORD; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer.
07資 10:17 Then the sons of Ammon were summoned, and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered together, and camped in Mizpah.
07資 10:18 And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, "Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07資 11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a harlot. And Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
07資 11:2 And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, "You shall not have an inheritance in our father's house, for you are the son of another woman."
07資 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless fellows gathered themselves about Jephthah, and they went out with him.
07資 11:4 And it came about after a while that the sons of Ammon fought against Israel.
07資 11:5 And it happened when the sons of Ammon fought against Israel that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob;
07資 11:6 and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our chief that we may fight against the sons of Ammon."
07資 11:7 Then Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me and drive me from my father's house? So why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?"
07資 11:8 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "For this reason we have now returned to you, that you may go with us and fight with the sons of Ammon and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07資 11:9 So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon and the LORD gives them up to me, will I become your head?"
07資 11:10 And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD is witness between us; surely we will do as you have said."
07資 11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the LORD at Mizpah.
07資 11:12 Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, "What is between you and me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?"
07資 11:13 And the king of the sons of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok and the Jordan; therefore, return them peaceably now."
07資 11:14 But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the sons of Ammon,
07資 11:15 and they said to him, "Thus says Jephthah, 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the sons of Ammon.
07資 11:16 'For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh,
07資 11:17 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, "Please let us pass through your land," but the king of Edom would not listen. And they also sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
07資 11:18 'Then they went through the wilderness and around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon [was] the border of Moab.
07資 11:19 'And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, "Please let us pass through your land to our place."
07資 11:20 'But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
07資 11:21 'And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
07資 11:22 'So they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan.
07資 11:23 'Since now the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites from before His people Israel, are you then to possess it?
07資 11:24 'Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has driven out before us, we will possess it.
07資 11:25 'And now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive with Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
07資 11:26 'While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?
07資 11:27 'I therefore have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the LORD, the Judge, judge today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.' "
07資 11:28 But the king of the sons of Ammon disregarded the message which Jephthah sent him.
07資 11:29 Now the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, so that he passed through Gilead and Manasseh; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon.
07資 11:30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, "If Thou wilt indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand,
07資 11:31 then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering. "
07資 11:32 So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD gave them into his hand.
07資 11:33 And he struck them with a very great slaughter from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
07資 11:34 When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she was his one [and] only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
07資 11:35 And it came about when he saw her, that he tore his clothes and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are among those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot take [it] back."
07資 11:36 So she said to him, "My father, you have given your word to the LORD; do to me as you have said, since the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the sons of Ammon."
07資 11:37 And she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go to the mountains and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions."
07資 11:38 Then he said, "Go." So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept on the mountains because of her virginity.
07資 11:39 And it came about at the end of two months that she returned to her father, who did to her according to the vow which he had made; and she had no relations with a man. Thus it became a custom in Israel,
07資 11:40 that the daughters of Israel went yearly to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
07資 12:1 Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you."
07資 12:2 And Jephthah said to them, "I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon; when I called you, you did not deliver me from their hand.
07資 12:3 "And when I saw that you would not deliver [me,] I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day, to fight against me?"
07資 12:4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You are fugitives of Ephraim, O Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim [and] in the midst of Manasseh."
07資 12:5 And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim. And it happened when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said," No, "
07資 12:6 then they would say to him, "Say now, 'Shibboleth.'" But he said, " Sibboleth, "for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. Thus there fell at that time 420000 of Ephraim.
07資 12:7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.
07資 12:8 Now Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel after him.
07資 12:9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters [whom] he gave in marriage outside [the family,] and he brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
07資 12:10 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
07資 12:11 Now Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel after him; and he judged Israel ten years.
07資 12:12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07資 12:13 Now Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel after him.
07資 12:14 And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel eight years.
07資 12:15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07資 13:1 Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, so that the LORD gave them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.
07資 13:2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no [children.]
07資 13:3 Then the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, "Behold now, you are barren and have borne no [children,] but you shall conceive and give birth to a son.
07資 13:4 "Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing.
07資 13:5 "For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines."
07資 13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, "A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he [came] from, nor did he tell me his name.
07資 13:7 "But he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.'"
07資 13:8 Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, "O Lord, please let the man of God whom Thou hast sent come to us again that he may teach us what to do for the boy who is to be born."
07資 13:9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.
07資 13:10 So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, "Behold, the man who came the [other] day has appeared to me."
07資 13:11 Then Manoah arose and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to the woman?" And he said, " I am. "
07資 13:12 And Manoah said, "Now when your words come [to pass,] what shall be the boy's mode of life and his vocation?"
07資 13:13 So the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Let the woman pay attention to all that I said.
07資 13:14 "She should not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; let her observe all that I commanded."
07資 13:15 Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please let us detain you so that we may prepare a kid for you."
07資 13:16 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Though you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, [then] offer it to the LORD." For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.
07資 13:17 And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that when your words come [to pass,] we may honor you?"
07資 13:18 But the angel of the LORD said to him, "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
07資 13:19 So Manoah took the kid with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders while Manoah and his wife looked on.
07資 13:20 For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw [this,] they fell on their faces to the ground.
07資 13:21 Now the angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah or his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
07資 13:22 So Manoah said to his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God."
07資 13:23 But his wife said to him, "If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have let us hear [things] like this at this time."
07資 13:24 Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the child grew up and the LORD blessed him.
07資 13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07資 14:1 Then Samson went down to Timnah and saw a woman in Timnah, [one] of the daughters of the Philistines.
07資 14:2 So he came back and told his father and mother, "I saw a woman in Timnah, [one] of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife."
07資 14:3 Then his father and his mother said to him, "Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me, for she looks good to me."
07資 14:4 However, his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
07資 14:5 Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion [came] roaring toward him.
07資 14:6 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, so that he tore him as one tears a kid though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
07資 14:7 So he went down and talked to the woman; and she looked good to Samson.
07資 14:8 When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.
07資 14:9 So he scraped the honey into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave [some] to them and they ate [it;] but he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion.
07資 14:10 Then his father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men customarily did this.
07資 14:11 And it came about when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
07資 14:12 Then Samson said to them, "Let me now propound a riddle to you; if you will indeed tell it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes.
07資 14:13 "But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes." And they said to him, "Propound your riddle, that we may hear it."
07資 14:14 So he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat, And out of the strong came something sweet." But they could not tell the riddle in three days.
07資 14:15 Then it came about on the fourth day that they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband, that he may tell us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us to impoverish us? Is this not [so?]"
07資 14:16 And Samson's wife wept before him and said, "You only hate me, and you do not love me; you have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told [it] to me." And he said to her, "Behold, I have not told [it] to my father or mother; so should I tell you?"
07資 14:17 However she wept before him seven days while their feast lasted. And it came about on the seventh day that he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the sons of her people.
07資 14:18 So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have found out my riddle."
07資 14:19 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their spoil, and gave the changes [of clothes] to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father's house.
07資 14:20 But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion who had been his friend.
07資 15:1 But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it came about that Samson visited his wife with a young goat, and said, "I will go in to my wife in [her] room." But her father did not let him enter.
07資 15:2 And her father said, "I really thought that you hated her intensely; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead."
07資 15:3 Samson then said to them, "This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm."
07資 15:4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned [the foxes] tail to tail, and put one torch in the middle between two tails.
07資 15:5 When he had set fire to the torches, he released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, thus burning up both the shocks and the standing grain, along with the vineyards [and] groves.
07資 15:6 Then the Philistines said, "Who did this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion." So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
07資 15:7 And Samson said to them, "Since you act like this, I will surely take revenge on you, but after that I will quit."
07資 15:8 And he struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
07資 15:9 Then the Philistines went up and camped in Judah, and spread out in Lehi.
07資 15:10 And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" And they said, "We have come up to bind Samson in order to do to him as he did to us."
07資 15:11 Then 30000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he said to them, " As they did to me, so I have done to them. "
07資 15:12 And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not kill me."
07資 15:13 So they said to him, "No, but we will bind you fast and give you into their hands; yet surely we will not kill you." Then they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
07資 15:14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands.
07資 15:15 And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it.
07資 15:16 Then Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have killed a thousand men."
07資 15:17 And it came about when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi.
07資 15:18 Then he became very thirsty, and he called to the LORD and said, " Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of Thy servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised? "
07資 15:19 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi so that water came out of it. When he drank, his strength returned and he revived. Therefore, he named it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
07資 15:20 So he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
07資 16:1 Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there, and went in to her.
07資 16:2 [When it was told] to the Gazites, saying, "Samson has come here," they surrounded [the place] and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. And they kept silent all night, saying," [Let us wait] until the morning light, then we will kill him. "
07資 16:3 Now Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up along with the bars; then he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron.
07資 16:4 After this it came about that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
07資 16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, " Entice him, and see where his great strength [lies] and how we may overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him. Then we will each give you eleven hundred [pieces] of silver. "
07資 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you."
07資 16:7 And Samson said to her, "If they bind me with seven fresh cords that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any [other] man."
07資 16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
07資 16:9 Now she had [men] lying in wait in an inner room. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the cords as a string of tow snaps when it touches fire. So his strength was not discovered.
07資 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson, "Behold, you have deceived me and told me lies; now please tell me, how you may be bound."
07資 16:11 And he said to her, "If they bind me tightly with new ropes which have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any [other] man."
07資 16:12 So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, " The Philistines are upon you, Samson! "For the [men] were lying in wait in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes from his arms like a thread.
07資 16:13 Then Delilah said to Samson, "Up to now you have deceived me and told me lies; tell me how you may be bound." And he said to her, "If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web {and fasten it with a pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man."
07資 16:14 So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the web}. And she fastened [it] with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web.
07資 16:15 Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is."
07資 16:16 And it came about when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, that his soul was annoyed to death.
07資 16:17 So he told her all [that was] in his heart and said to her, "A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I shall become weak and be like any [other] man."
07資 16:18 When Delilah saw that he had told her all [that was] in his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up once more, for he has told me all [that is] in his heart." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hands.
07資 16:19 And she made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his hair. Then she began to afflict him, and his strength left him.
07資 16:20 And she said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.
07資 16:21 Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains, and he was a grinder in the prison.
07資 16:22 However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
07資 16:23 Now the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice, for they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands."
07資 16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, " Our god has given our enemy into our hands, Even the destroyer of our country, Who has slain many of us. "
07資 16:25 It so happened when they were in high spirits, that they said, "Call for Samson, that he may amuse us." So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. And they made him stand between the pillars.
07資 16:26 Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them."
07資 16:27 Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And about 30000 men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing [them].
07資 16:28 Then Samson called to the LORD and said, "O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
07資 16:29 And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.
07資 16:30 And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" And he bent with all his might so that the house fell on the lords and all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life.
07資 16:31 Then his brothers and all his father's household came down, took him, brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. Thus he had judged Israel twenty years.
07資 17:1 Now there was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
07資 17:2 And he said to his mother, "The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD."
07資 17:3 He then returned the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother, and his mother said, "I wholly dedicate the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore, I will return them to you."
07資 17:4 So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred [pieces] of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made them into a graven image and a molten image, and they were in the house of Micah.
07資 17:5 And the man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and household idols and consecrated one of his sons, that he might become his priest.
07資 17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
07資 17:7 Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there.
07資 17:8 Then the man departed from the city, from Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he might find [a place;] and as he made his journey, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
07資 17:9 And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I may find [a place.]"
07資 17:10 Micah then said to him, "Dwell with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten [pieces] of silver a year, a suit of clothes, and your maintenance." So the Levite went [in.]
07資 17:11 And the Levite agreed to live with the man; and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
07資 17:12 So Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah.
07資 17:13 Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, seeing I have a Levite as priest."
07資 18:1 In those days there was no king of Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for themselves to live in, for until that day an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel.
07資 18:2 So the sons of Dan sent from their family five men out of their whole number, valiant men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, "Go, search the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
07資 18:3 When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, " Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this [place?] And what do you have here? "
07資 18:4 And he said to them, "Thus and so has Micah done to me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest."
07資 18:5 And they said to him, "Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether our way on which we are going will be prosperous."
07資 18:6 And the priest said to them, "Go in peace; your way in which you are going has the Lord's approval."
07資 18:7 Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were in it living in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no ruler humiliating [them] for anything in the land, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
07資 18:8 When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, "What [do] you [report?]"
07資 18:9 And they said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter, to possess the land.
07資 18:10 "When you enter, you shall come to a secure people with a spacious land; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth."
07資 18:11 Then from the family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out.
07資 18:12 And they went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim.
07資 18:13 And they passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
07資 18:14 Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their kinsmen, "Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod and household idols and a graven image and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you should do."
07資 18:15 And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
07資 18:16 And the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
07資 18:17 Now the five men who went to spy out the land went up [and] entered there, [and] took the graven image and the ephod and household idols and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
07資 18:18 And when these went into Micah's house and took the graven image, the ephod and household idols and the molten image, the priest said to them, " What are you doing? "
07資 18:19 And they said to him, "Be silent, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"
07資 18:20 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod and household idols and the graven image, and went among the people.
07資 18:21 Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the valuables in front of them.
07資 18:22 When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who [were] in the houses near Micah's house assembled and overtook the sons of Dan.
07資 18:23 And they cried to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, "What is [the matter] with you, that you have assembled together?"
07資 18:24 And he said, "You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what do I have besides? So how can you say to me, 'What is [the matter] with you?'"
07資 18:25 And the sons of Dan said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest fierce men fall upon you and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."
07資 18:26 So the sons of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
07資 18:27 Then they took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire.
07資 18:28 And there was no one to deliver [them,] because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley which is near Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
07資 18:29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father who was born in Israel; however, the name of the city formerly was Laish.
07資 18:30 And the sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
07資 18:31 So they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he had made, all the time that the house of God was at Shiloh.
07資 19:1 Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah.
07資 19:2 But his concubine played the harlot against him, and she went away from him to her father's house in Bethlehem in Judah, and was there for a period of four months.
07資 19:3 Then her husband arose and went after her to speak tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father's house, and when the girl's father saw him, he was glad to meet him.
07資 19:4 And his father-in-law, the girl's father, detained him; and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.
07資 19:5 Now it came about on the fourth day that they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to go; and the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Sustain yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward you may go."
07資 19:6 So both of them sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, "Please be willing to spend the night, and let your heart be merry."
07資 19:7 Then the man arose to go, but his father-in-law urged him so that he spent the night there again.
07資 19:8 And on the fifth day he arose to go early in the morning, and the girl's father said, "Please sustain yourself, and wait until afternoon"; so both of them ate.
07資 19:9 When the man arose to go along with his concubine and servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold now, the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Lo, the day is coming to an end; spend the night here that your heart may be merry. Then tomorrow you may arise early for your journey so that you may go home."
07資 19:10 But the man was not willing to spend the night, so he arose and departed and came to [a place] opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a pair of saddled donkeys; his concubine also was with him.
07資 19:11 When they [were] near Jebus, the day was almost gone; and the servant said to his master, "Please come, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it."
07資 19:12 However, his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners who are not of the sons of Israel; but we will go on as far as Gibeah."
07資 19:13 And he said to his servant, "Come and let us approach one of these places; and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."
07資 19:14 So they passed along and went their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin.
07資 19:15 And they turned aside there in order to enter [and] lodge in Gibeah. When they entered, they sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into [his] house to spend the night.
07資 19:16 Then behold, an old man was coming out of the field from his work at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was staying in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjamites.
07資 19:17 And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going, and where do you come from?"
07資 19:18 And he said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, [for] I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. But I am [now] going to my house, and no man will take me into his house.
07資 19:19 "Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your maidservant, and the young man who is with your servants; there is no lack of anything."
07資 19:20 And the old man said, "Peace to you. Only let me [take care of] all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the open square."
07資 19:21 So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder, and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
07資 19:22 While they were making merry, behold, the men of the city, certain worthless fellows, surrounded the house, pounding the door; and they spoke to the owner of the house, the old man, saying, "Bring out the man who came into your house that we may have relations with him."
07資 19:23 Then the man, the owner of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my fellows, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not commit this act of folly.
07資 19:24 "Here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Please let me bring them out that you may ravish them and do to them whatever you wish. But do not commit such an act of folly against this man."
07資 19:25 But the men would not listen to him, so the man seized his concubine and brought [her] out to them. And they raped her and abused her all night until morning, then let her go at the approach of dawn.
07資 19:26 As the day began to dawn, the woman came and fell down at the doorway of the man's house where her master was, until [full] daylight.
07資 19:27 When her master arose in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, then behold, his concubine was lying at the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
07資 19:28 And he said to her, "Get up and let us go," but there was no answer. Then he placed her on the donkey; and the man arose and went to his home.
07資 19:29 When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine and cut her in twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel.
07資 19:30 And it came about that all who saw [it] said, "Nothing like this has [ever] happened or been seen from the day when the sons of Israel came up from the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel and speak up!"
07資 20:1 Then all the sons of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah.
07資 20:2 And the chiefs of all the people, [even] of all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, 4000000 foot soldiers who drew the sword.
07資 20:3 (Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, "Tell [us,] how did this wickedness take place?"
07資 20:4 So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, "I came with my concubine to spend the night at Gibeah which belongs to Benjamin.
07資 20:5 "But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me; instead, they ravished my concubine so that she died.
07資 20:6 "And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout the land of Israel's inheritance; for they have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
07資 20:7 "Behold, all you sons of Israel, give your advice and counsel here."
07資 20:8 Then all the people arose as one man, saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, nor will any of us return to his house.
07資 20:9 "But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; [we will go up] against it by lot.
07資 20:10 "And we will take 10 men out of 100 throughout the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 10000, and 10000 out of 100000 to supply food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish [them] for all the disgraceful acts that they have committed in Israel."
07資 20:11 Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.
07資 20:12 Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that has taken place among you?
07資 20:13 "Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove [this] wickedness from Israel." But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel.
07資 20:14 And the sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.
07資 20:15 And from the cities on that day the sons of Benjamin were numbered, 260000 men who draw the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah who were numbered, 700 choice men.
07資 20:16 Out of all these people 700 choice men were left-handed; each one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
07資 20:17 Then the men of Israel besides Benjamin were numbered, 4000000 men who draw the sword; all these were men of war.
07資 20:18 Now the sons of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, and said, "Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?" Then the LORD said, "Judah [shall go up] first."
07資 20:19 So the sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah.
07資 20:20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arrayed for battle against them at Gibeah.
07資 20:21 Then the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and felled to the ground on that day 220000 men of Israel.
07資 20:22 But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the first day.
07資 20:23 And the sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall we again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him."
07資 20:24 Then the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day.
07資 20:25 And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah the second day and felled to the ground again 180000 men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.
07資 20:26 Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; thus they remained there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
07資 20:27 And the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God [was] there in those days,
07資 20:28 and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, Aaron's son, stood before it to [ minister] in those days), saying, "Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand."
07資 20:29 So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.
07資 20:30 And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah, as at other times.
07資 20:31 And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people, as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, [and] in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
07資 20:32 And the sons of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us, as at the first." But the sons of Israel said, "Let us flee that we may draw them away from the city to the highways."
07資 20:33 Then all the men of Israel arose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel in ambush broke out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
07資 20:34 When ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle became fierce; but Benjamin did not know that disaster was close to them.
07資 20:35 And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, so that the sons of Israel destroyed 251000 men of Benjamin that day, all who draw the sword.
07資 20:36 So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah,
07資 20:37 the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush also deployed and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
07資 20:38 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city.
07資 20:39 Then the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
07資 20:40 But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them; and behold, the whole city was going up [ in smoke] to heaven.
07資 20:41 Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster was close to them.
07資 20:42 Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them while those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.
07資 20:43 They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest [and] trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east.
07資 20:44 Thus 180000 men of Benjamin fell; all these were valiant warriors.
07資 20:45 The rest turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they caught 50000 of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and killed 20000 of them.
07資 20:46 So all of Benjamin who fell that day were 250000 men who draw the sword; all these were valiant warriors.
07資 20:47 But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months.
07資 20:48 The men of Israel then turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city with the cattle and all that they found; they also set on fire all the cities which they found.
07資 21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, "None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin in marriage."
07資 21:2 So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
07資 21:3 And they said, "Why, O LORD, God of Israel, has this come about in Israel, so that one tribe should be [missing] today in Israel?"
07資 21:4 And it came about the next day that the people arose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
07資 21:5 Then the sons of Israel said, "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death."
07資 21:6 And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel today.
07資 21:7 "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
07資 21:8 And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?" And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
07資 21:9 For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there.
07資 21:10 And the congregation sent 120000 of the valiant warriors there, and commanded them, saying, "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
07資 21:11 "And this is the thing that you shall do you shall utterly destroy every man and every woman who has lain with a man."
07資 21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
07資 21:13 Then the whole congregation sent [word] and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
07資 21:14 And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; yet they were not enough for them.
07資 21:15 And the people were sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
07資 21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
07資 21:17 And they said, "[There must be] an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be blotted out from Israel.
07資 21:18 "But we cannot give them wives of our daughters." For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, "Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin."
07資 21:19 So they said, "Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south side of Lebonah."
07資 21:20 And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
07資 21:21 and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to take part in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
07資 21:22 "And it shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, 'Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take for each man [of Benjamin] a wife in battle, nor did you give [them] to them, [else] you would now be guilty.'"
07資 21:23 And the sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they carried away. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the cities and lived in them.
07資 21:24 And the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and each one of them went out from there to his inheritance.
07資 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

08訣 1:1 Now it came about in the days when the judges governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.
08訣 1:2 And the name of the man [was] Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons [were] Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they entered the land of Moab and remained there.
08訣 1:3 Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.
08訣 1:4 And they took for themselves Moabite women [as] wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.
08訣 1:5 Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; and the woman was bereft of her two children and her husband.
08訣 1:6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the LORD had visited His people in giving them food.
08訣 1:7 So she departed from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
08訣 1:8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
08訣 1:9 "May the LORD grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband." Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
08訣 1:10 And they said to her, "[No,] but we will surely return with you to your people."
08訣 1:11 But Naomi said, "Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
08訣 1:12 "Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons,
08訣 1:13 would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is harder for me than for you, for the hand of the LORD has gone forth against me. "
08訣 1:14 And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
08訣 1:15 Then she said, "Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
08訣 1:16 But Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you [or] turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people [shall be] my people, and your God, my God.
08訣 1:17 "Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may the LORD do to me, and worse, if [anything but] death parts you and me."
08訣 1:18 When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.
08訣 1:19 So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came about when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, "Is this Naomi?"
08訣 1:20 And she said to them, "Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
08訣 1:21 "I went out full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
08訣 1:22 So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
08訣 2:1 Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.
08訣 2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one in whose sight I may find favor." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter."
08訣 2:3 So she departed and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
08訣 2:4 Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, "May the LORD be with you." And they said to him, "May the LORD bless you."
08訣 2:5 Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?"
08訣 2:6 And the servant in charge of the reapers answered and said, "She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.
08訣 2:7 "And she said, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while."
08訣 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my maids.
08訣 2:9 "Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the servants not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the servants draw."
08訣 2:10 Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, "Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?"
08訣 2:11 And Boaz answered and said to her, "All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully reported to me, and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know.
08訣 2:12 "May the LORD reward your work, and your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge."
08訣 2:13 Then she said, "I have found favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants."
08訣 2:14 And at mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar." So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left.
08訣 2:15 When she rose to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her.
08訣 2:16 "And also you shall purposely pull out for her [some grain] from the bundles and leave [it] that she may glean, and do not rebuke her."
08訣 2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
08訣 2:18 And she took [it] up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took [it] out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied.
08訣 2:19 Her mother-in-law then said to her, "Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed." So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, "The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz."
08訣 2:20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "May he be blessed of the LORD who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead." Again Naomi said to her, "The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives."
08訣 2:21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "Furthermore, he said to me, 'You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.'"
08訣 2:22 And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, lest [others] fall upon you in another field."
08訣 2:23 So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
08訣 3:1 Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you?
08訣 3:2 "And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight.
08訣 3:3 "Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your [best] clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; [but] do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
08訣 3:4 "And it shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do."
08訣 3:5 And she said to her, "All that you say I will do."
08訣 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
08訣 3:7 When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down.
08訣 3:8 And it happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.
08訣 3:9 And he said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative."
08訣 3:10 Then he said, "May you be blessed of the LORD, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich.
08訣 3:11 "And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence.
08訣 3:12 "And now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I.
08訣 3:13 "Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until morning."
08訣 3:14 So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
08訣 3:15 Again he said, "Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it." So she held it, and he measured six [measures] of barley and laid [it] on her. Then she went into the city.
08訣 3:16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had done for her.
08訣 3:17 And she said, "These six [measures] of barley he gave to me, for he said, 'Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
08訣 3:18 Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today."
08訣 4:1 Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the close relative of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, "Turn aside, friend, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down.
08訣 4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, "Sit down here." So they sat down.
08訣 4:3 Then he said to the closest relative, "Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.
08訣 4:4 "So I thought to inform you, saying, 'Buy [it] before those who are sitting [here,] and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem [it,] redeem [it;] but if not, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem [it,] and I am after you.'" And he said, "I will redeem [it.]"
08訣 4:5 Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance."
08訣 4:6 And the closest relative said, "I cannot redeem [it] for myself, lest I jeopardize my own inheritance. Redeem [it] for yourself; you [may have] my right of redemption, for I cannot redeem [it.]"
08訣 4:7 Now this was [the custom] in former times in Israel concerning the redemption and the exchange [of land] to confirm any matter a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.
08訣 4:8 So the closest relative said to Boaz, "Buy [it] for yourself." And he removed his sandal.
08訣 4:9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.
08訣 4:10 "Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased may not be cut off from his brothers or from the court of his [birth] place; you are witnesses today."
08訣 4:11 And all the people who were in the court, and the elders, said, "[ We are] witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel; and may you achieve wealth in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem.
08訣 4:12 "Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring which the LORD shall give you by this young woman."
08訣 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
08訣 4:14 Then the women said to Naomi, "Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel.
08訣 4:15 "May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him."
08訣 4:16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her lap, and became his nurse.
08訣 4:17 And the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, "A son has been born to Naomi!" So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08訣 4:18 Now these are the generations of Perez to Perez was born Hezron,
08訣 4:19 and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab,
08訣 4:20 and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon,
08訣 4:21 and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed,
08訣 4:22 and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, David.

09誌雌 1:1 Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
09誌雌 1:2 And he had two wives the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
09誌雌 1:3 Now this man would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas were priests to the LORD there.
09誌雌 1:4 And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;
09誌雌 1:5 but to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had closed her womb.
09誌雌 1:6 Her rival, however, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
09誌雌 1:7 And it happened year after year, as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she would provoke her, so she wept and would not eat.
09誌雌 1:8 Then Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
09誌雌 1:9 Then Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
09誌雌 1:10 And she, greatly distressed, prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.
09誌雌 1:11 And she made a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy maidservant and remember me, and not forget Thy maidservant, but wilt give Thy maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head."
09誌雌 1:12 Now it came about, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth.
09誌雌 1:13 As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.
09誌雌 1:14 Then Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you."
09誌雌 1:15 But Hannah answered and said, "No, my lord, I am a woman oppressed in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.
09誌雌 1:16 "Do not consider your maidservant as a worthless woman; for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation."
09誌雌 1:17 Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him."
09誌雌 1:18 And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your sight." So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer [sad.]
09誌雌 1:19 Then they arose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
09誌雌 1:20 And it came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying,] "Because I have asked him of the LORD."
09誌雌 1:21 Then the man Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and [pay] his vow.
09誌雌 1:22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "[I will not go up] until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD and stay there forever."
09誌雌 1:23 And Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you. Remain until you have weaned him; only may the LORD confirm His word." So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
09誌雌 1:24 Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young.
09誌雌 1:25 Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.
09誌雌 1:26 And she said, "Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the LORD.
09誌雌 1:27 "For this boy I prayed, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of Him.
09誌雌 1:28 "So I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
09誌雌 2:1 Then Hannah prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD, My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, Because I rejoice in Thy salvation.
09誌雌 2:2 "There is no one holy like the LORD, Indeed, there is no one besides Thee, Nor is there any rock like our God.
09誌雌 2:3 "Boast no more so very proudly, Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And with Him actions are weighed.
09誌雌 2:4 "The bows of the mighty are shattered, But the feeble gird on strength.
09誌雌 2:5 "Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, But those who were hungry cease [to hunger.] Even the barren gives birth to seven, But she who has many children languishes.
09誌雌 2:6 "The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.
09誌雌 2:7 "The LORD makes poor and rich; He brings low, He also exalts.
09誌雌 2:8 "He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap To make them sit with nobles, And inherit a seat of honor; For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, And He set the world on them.
09誌雌 2:9 "He keeps the feet of His godly ones, But the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; For not by might shall a man prevail.
09誌雌 2:10 "Those who contend with the LORD will be shattered; Against them He will thunder in the heavens, The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength to His king, And will exalt the horn of His anointed."
09誌雌 2:11 Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
09誌雌 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know the LORD
09誌雌 2:13 and the custom of the priests with the people. When any man was offering a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand.
09誌雌 2:14 Then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
09誌雌 2:15 Also, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest meat for roasting, as he will not take boiled meat from you, only raw."
09誌雌 2:16 And if the man said to him, "They must surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as you desire," then he would say, "No, but you shall give [it to me] now; and if not, I will take it by force."
09誌雌 2:17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD, for the men despised the offering of the LORD.
09誌雌 2:18 Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, [as] a boy wearing a linen ephod.
09誌雌 2:19 And his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year when she would come up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
09誌雌 2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, "May the LORD give you children from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD." And they went to their own home.
09誌雌 2:21 And the LORD visited Hannah; and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the LORD.
09誌雌 2:22 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
09誌雌 2:23 And he said to them, "Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people?
09誌雌 2:24 "No, my sons; for the report is not good which I hear the Lord's people circulating.
09誌雌 2:25 "If one man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the LORD desired to put them to death.
09誌雌 2:26 Now the boy Samuel was growing in stature and in favor both with the LORD and with men.
09誌雌 2:27 Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Did I [not] indeed reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?
09誌雌 2:28 'And did I [not] choose them from all the tribes of Israel to be My priests, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to carry an ephod before Me; and did I [not] give to the house of your father all the fire [offerings] of the sons of Israel?
09誌雌 2:29 'Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded [in My] dwelling, and honor your sons above Me, by making yourselves fat with the choicest of every offering of My people Israel?'
09誌雌 2:30 "Therefore the LORD God of Israel declares, 'I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever'; but now the LORD declares,' Far be it from Me-- for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be lightly esteemed.
09誌雌 2:31 'Behold, the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father's house so that there will not be an old man in your house.
09誌雌 2:32 'And you will see the distress of [My] dwelling, in [spite of] all that I do good for Israel; and an old man will not be in your house forever.
09誌雌 2:33 'Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar that your eyes may fail [from weeping] and your soul grieve, and all the increase of your house will die in the prime of life.
09誌雌 2:34 'And this will be the sign to you which shall come concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas on the same day both of them shall die.
09誌雌 2:35 'But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed always.
09誌雌 2:36 'And it shall come about that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and say, "Please assign me to one of the priest's offices so that I may eat a piece of bread."' "
09誌雌 3:1 Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD before Eli. And word from the LORD was rare in those days, visions were infrequent.
09誌雌 3:2 And it happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim [and] he could not see well),
09誌雌 3:3 and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God [was,]
09誌雌 3:4 that the LORD called Samuel; and he said, "Here I am."
09誌雌 3:5 Then he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, lie down again." So he went and lay down.
09誌雌 3:6 And the LORD called yet again, "Samuel!" So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he answered, "I did not call, my son, lie down again."
09誌雌 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, nor had the word of the LORD yet been revealed to him.
09誌雌 3:8 So the LORD called Samuel again for the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli discerned that the LORD was calling the boy.
09誌雌 3:9 And Eli said to Samuel, "Go lie down, and it shall be if He calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for Thy servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
09誌雌 3:10 Then the LORD came and stood and called as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for Thy servant is listening."
09誌雌 3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.
09誌雌 3:12 "In that day I will carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
09誌雌 3:13 "For I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke them.
09誌雌 3:14 "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever."
09誌雌 3:15 So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
09誌雌 3:16 Then Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he said, "Here I am."
09誌雌 3:17 And he said, "What is the word that He spoke to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the words that He spoke to you."
09誌雌 3:18 So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him."
09誌雌 3:19 Thus Samuel grew and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fail.
09誌雌 3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.
09誌雌 3:21 And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, because the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
09誌雌 4:1 Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped in Aphek.
09誌雌 4:2 And the Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.
09誌雌 4:3 When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us take to ourselves from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that it may come among us and deliver us from the power of our enemies."
09誌雌 4:4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who sits [above] the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God.
09誌雌 4:5 And it happened as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, that all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.
09誌雌 4:6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, "What [does] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews [mean?]" Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.
09誌雌 4:7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, "God has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
09誌雌 4:8 "Woe to us! Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all [kinds of] plagues in the wilderness.
09誌雌 4:9 "Take courage and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; therefore, be men and fight."
09誌雌 4:10 So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent, and the slaughter was very great; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
09誌雌 4:11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
09誌雌 4:12 Now a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head.
09誌雌 4:13 When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on [his] seat by the road eagerly watching, because his heart was trembling for the ark of God. So the man came to tell [it] in the city, and all the city cried out.
09誌雌 4:14 When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, "What [does] the noise of this commotion [mean?]" Then the man came hurriedly and told Eli.
09誌雌 4:15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set so that he could not see.
09誌雌 4:16 And the man said to Eli, "I am the one who came from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today." And he said, "How did things go, my son?"
09誌雌 4:17 Then the one who brought the news answered and said, "Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken."
09誌雌 4:18 And it came about when he mentioned the ark of God that Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. Thus he judged Israel forty years.
09誌雌 4:19 Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was pregnant and about to give birth; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.
09誌雌 4:20 And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son." But she did not answer or pay attention.
09誌雌 4:21 And she called the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel," because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
09誌雌 4:22 And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God was taken."
09誌雌 5:1 Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
09誌雌 5:2 Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
09誌雌 5:3 When the Ashdodites arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again.
09誌雌 5:4 But when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD. And the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
09誌雌 5:5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor all who enter Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
09誌雌 5:6 Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He ravaged them and smote them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories.
09誌雌 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god."
09誌雌 5:8 So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" And they said, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." And they brought the ark of the God of Israel [around.]
09誌雌 5:9 And it came about that after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city with very great confusion; and He smote the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
09誌雌 5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it happened as the ark of God came to Ekron that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought the ark of the God of Israel around to us, to kill us and our people."
09誌雌 5:11 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people." For there was a deadly confusion throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
09誌雌 5:12 And the men who did not die were smitten with tumors and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
09誌雌 6:1 Now the ark of the LORD had been in the country of the Philistines seven months.
09誌雌 6:2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, " What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we shall send it to its place. "
09誌雌 6:3 And they said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but you shall surely return to Him a guilt offering. Then you shall be healed and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you."
09誌雌 6:4 Then they said, "What shall be the guilt offering which we shall return to Him?" And they said, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines, for one plague was on all of you and on your lords.
09誌雌 6:5 "So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and likenesses of your mice that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will ease His hand from you, your gods, and your land.
09誌雌 6:6 "Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not allow the people to go, and they departed?
09誌雌 6:7 "Now therefore take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home, away from them.
09誌雌 6:8 "And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a guilt offering in a box by its side. Then send it away that it may go.
09誌雌 6:9 "And watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that it was not His hand that struck us; it happened to us by chance."
09誌雌 6:10 Then the men did so, and took two milch cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
09誌雌 6:11 And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the likenesses of their tumors.
09誌雌 6:12 And the cows took the straight way in the direction of Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. And the lords of the Philistines followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
09誌雌 6:13 Now [the people of] Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley, and they raised their eyes and saw the ark and were glad to see [it.]
09誌雌 6:14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stood there where there [was] a large stone; and they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
09誌雌 6:15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the LORD.
09誌雌 6:16 And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron that day.
09誌雌 6:17 And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a guilt offering to the LORD one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;
09誌雌 6:18 and the golden mice, [according] to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large stone on which they set the ark of the LORD [is a witness] to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
09誌雌 6:19 And He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck down of all the people, 50,070 men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter.
09誌雌 6:20 And the men of Beth-shemesh said, "Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?"
09誌雌 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, "The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come down and take it up to you."
09誌雌 7:1 And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the ark of the LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
09誌雌 7:2 And it came about from the day that the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim that the time was long, for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
09誌雌 7:3 Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you return to the LORD with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him alone; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines."
09誌雌 7:4 So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the LORD alone.
09誌雌 7:5 Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."
09誌雌 7:6 And they gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the sons of Israel at Mizpah.
09誌雌 7:7 Now when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
09誌雌 7:8 Then the sons of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines."
09誌雌 7:9 And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel and the LORD answered him.
09誌雌 7:10 Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel.
09誌雌 7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as below Beth-car.
09誌雌 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far the LORD has helped us."
09誌雌 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
09誌雌 7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. So there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
09誌雌 7:15 Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
09誌雌 7:16 And he used to go annually on circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places.
09誌雌 7:17 Then his return [was] to Ramah, for his house [was] there, and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar to the LORD.
09誌雌 8:1 And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.
09誌雌 8:2 Now the name of his first-born was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; [they] were judging in Beersheba.
09誌雌 8:3 His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain and took bribes and perverted justice.
09誌雌 8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah;
09誌雌 8:5 and they said to him, "Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations."
09誌雌 8:6 But the thing was displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said, " Give us a king to judge us. "And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
09誌雌 8:7 And the LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being king over them.
09誌雌 8:8 "Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day-- in that they have forsaken Me and served other gods-- so they are doing to you also.
09誌雌 8:9 "Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall solemnly warn them and tell them of the procedure of the king who will reign over them."
09誌雌 8:10 So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who had asked of him a king.
09誌雌 8:11 And he said, "This will be the procedure of the king who will reign over you he will take your sons and place [them] for himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots.
09誌雌 8:12 "And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and of fifties, and [some] to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
09誌雌 8:13 "He will also take your daughters for perfumers and cooks and bakers.
09誌雌 8:14 "And he will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive groves, and give [them] to his servants.
09誌雌 8:15 "And he will take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and to his servants.
09誌雌 8:16 "He will also take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys, and use [them] for his work.
09誌雌 8:17 "He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants.
09誌雌 8:18 "Then you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day."
09誌雌 8:19 Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, "No, but there shall be a king over us,
09誌雌 8:20 that we also may be like all the nations, that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. "
09誌雌 8:21 Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the Lord's hearing.
09誌雌 8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, "Listen to their voice, and appoint them a king." So Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city."
09誌雌 9:1 Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
09誌雌 9:2 And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome [man,] and there was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel; from his shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people.
09誌雌 9:3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, "Take now with you one of the servants, and arise, go search for the donkeys."
09誌雌 9:4 And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find [them.] Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but [they were] not [there.] Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find [them.]
09誌雌 9:5 When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, and let us return, lest my father cease [to be concerned] about the donkeys and become anxious for us."
09誌雌 9:6 And he said to him, "Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; all that he says surely comes true. Now let us go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey on which we have set out."
09誌雌 9:7 Then Saul said to his servant, "But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sack and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
09誌雌 9:8 And the servant answered Saul again and said, "Behold, I have in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give [it] to the man of God and he will tell us our way."
09誌雌 9:9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he used to say, "Come, and let us go to the seer"; for [he who is called] a prophet now was formerly called a seer.)
09誌雌 9:10 Then Saul said to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.
09誌雌 9:11 As they went up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"
09誌雌 9:12 And they answered them and said, "He is; see, [he is] ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today, for the people have a sacrifice on the high place today.
09誌雌 9:13 "As soon as you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up for you will find him at once."
09誌雌 9:14 So they went up to the city. As they came into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.
09誌雌 9:15 Now a day before Saul's coming, the LORD had revealed [this] to Samuel saying,
09誌雌 9:16 "About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Israel; and he shall deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have regarded My people, because their cry has come to Me."
09誌雌 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, "Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people."
09誌雌 9:18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate, and said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."
09誌雌 9:19 And Samuel answered Saul and said, "I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind.
09誌雌 9:20 "And as for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's household?"
09誌雌 9:21 And Saul answered and said, "Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me in this way?"
09誌雌 9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, who were about thirty men.
09誌雌 9:23 And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion that I gave you, concerning which I said to you, 'Set it aside.'"
09誌雌 9:24 Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, "Here is what has been reserved! Set [it] before you [and] eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, since I said I have invited the people." So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
09誌雌 9:25 When they came down from the high place into the city, [Samuel] spoke with Saul on the roof.
09誌雌 9:26 And they arose early; and it came about at daybreak that Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, "Get up, that I may send you away." So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.
09誌雌 9:27 As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Say to the servant that he might go ahead of us and pass on, but you remain standing now, that I may proclaim the word of God to you."
09誌雌 10:1 Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on his head, kissed him and said, "Has not the LORD anointed you a ruler over His inheritance?
09誌雌 10:2 "When you go from me today, then you will find two men close to Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, 'The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now behold, your father has ceased to be concerned about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying," What shall I do about my son? "'
09誌雌 10:3 "Then you will go on further from there, and you will come as far as the oak of Tabor, and there three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine;
09誌雌 10:4 and they will greet you and give you two [loaves] of bread, which you will accept from their hand.
09誌雌 10:5 "Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre before them, and they will be prophesying.
09誌雌 10:6 "Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you mightily, and you shall prophesy with them and be changed into another man.
09誌雌 10:7 "And it shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires; for God is with you.
09誌雌 10:8 "And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do."
09誌雌 10:9 Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day.
09誌雌 10:10 When they came to the hill there, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him mightily, so that he prophesied among them.
09誌雌 10:11 And it came about, when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied now with the prophets, that the people said to one another, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 10:12 And a man there answered and said, "Now, who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 10:13 When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
09誌雌 10:14 Now Saul's uncle said to him and his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said," To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they could not be found, we went to Samuel. "
09誌雌 10:15 And Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
09誌雌 10:16 So Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.
09誌雌 10:17 Thereafter Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah;
09誌雌 10:18 and he said to the sons of Israel, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'
09誌雌 10:19 "But you today rejected your God, who delivers you from all your calamities and your distresses; yet you have said, 'No, but set a king over us!' Now therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your clans."
09誌雌 10:20 Thus Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
09誌雌 10:21 Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the Matrite family was taken. And Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.
09誌雌 10:22 Therefore they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" So the LORD said, "Behold, he is hiding himself by the baggage."
09誌雌 10:23 So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
09誌雌 10:24 And Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? Surely there is no one like him among all the people." So all the people shouted and said, "[Long] live the king!"
09誌雌 10:25 Then Samuel told the people the ordinances of the kingdom, and wrote [them] in the book and placed [it] before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his house.
09誌雌 10:26 And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah; and the valiant [men] whose hearts God had touched went with him.
09誌雌 10:27 But certain worthless men said, "How can this one deliver us?" And they despised him and did not bring him any present. But he kept silent.
09誌雌 11:1 Now Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us and we will serve you."
09誌雌 11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "I will make [it] with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, thus I will make it a reproach on all Israel."
09誌雌 11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said to him, "Let us alone for seven days, that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you."
09誌雌 11:4 Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
09誌雌 11:5 Now behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen; and he said, "What is [the matter] with the people that they weep?" So they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
09誌雌 11:6 Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became very angry.
09誌雌 11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent [them] throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, "Whoever does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen." Then the dread of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
09誌雌 11:8 And he numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were 3000000, and the men of Judah 300000.
09誌雌 11:9 And they said to the messengers who had come, "Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" So the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
09誌雌 11:10 Then the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
09誌雌 11:11 And it happened the next morning that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch, and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it came about that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
09誌雌 11:12 Then the people said to Samuel, "Who is he that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death."
09誌雌 11:13 But Saul said, "Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has accomplished deliverance in Israel."
09誌雌 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there."
09誌雌 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they also offered sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
09誌雌 12:1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, "Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and I have appointed a king over you.
09誌雌 12:2 "And now, here is the king walking before you, but I am old and gray, and behold my sons are with you. And I have walked before you from my youth even to this day.
09誌雌 12:3 "Here I am; bear witness against me before the LORD and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? I will restore [it] to you."
09誌雌 12:4 And they said, "You have not defrauded us, or oppressed us, or taken anything from any man's hand."
09誌雌 12:5 And he said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing in my hand." And they said, "[He is] witness."
09誌雌 12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.
09誌雌 12:7 "So now, take your stand, that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did for you and your fathers.
09誌雌 12:8 "When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
09誌雌 12:9 "But they forgot the LORD their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
09誌雌 12:10 "And they cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve Thee.'
09誌雌 12:11 "Then the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security.
09誌雌 12:12 "When you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' although the LORD your God [was] your king.
09誌雌 12:13 "Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have asked for, and behold, the LORD has set a king over you.
09誌雌 12:14 "If you will fear the LORD and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and also the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God.
09誌雌 12:15 "And if you will not listen to the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the command of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you, [as it was] against your fathers.
09誌雌 12:16 "Even now, take your stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes.
09誌雌 12:17 "Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the LORD by asking for yourselves a king."
09誌雌 12:18 So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
09誌雌 12:19 Then all the people said to Samuel, "Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, so that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins [this] evil by asking for ourselves a king."
09誌雌 12:20 And Samuel said to the people, "Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
09誌雌 12:21 "And you must not turn aside, for [then you would go] after futile things which can not profit or deliver, because they are futile.
09誌雌 12:22 "For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.
09誌雌 12:23 "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way.
09誌雌 12:24 "Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.
09誌雌 12:25 "But if you still do wickedly, both you and your king shall be swept away."
09誌雌 13:1 Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign, and he reigned [ thirty]-two years over Israel.
09誌雌 13:2 Now Saul chose for himself 30000 men of Israel, of which 20000 were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 10000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent.
09誌雌 13:3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of [it.] Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear."
09誌雌 13:4 And all Israel heard the news that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. The people were then summoned to Saul at Gilgal.
09誌雌 13:5 Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 300000 chariots and 60000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
09誌雌 13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits.
09誌雌 13:7 Also [some of] the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he [was] still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
09誌雌 13:8 Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him.
09誌雌 13:9 So Saul said, "Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.
09誌雌 13:10 And it came about as soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, that behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him [and] to greet him.
09誌雌 13:11 But Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,
09誌雌 13:12 therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the LORD.' So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering. "
09誌雌 13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, for now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
09誌雌 13:14 "But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."
09誌雌 13:15 Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.
09誌雌 13:16 Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
09誌雌 13:17 And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,
09誌雌 13:18 and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
09誌雌 13:19 Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears."
09誌雌 13:20 So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe.
09誌雌 13:21 And the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the hoes.
09誌雌 13:22 So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who [were] with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan.
09誌雌 13:23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
09誌雌 14:1 Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man who was carrying his armor, "Come and let us cross over to the Philistines' garrison that is on yonder side." But he did not tell his father.
09誌雌 14:2 And Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron. And the people who [were] with him [were] about six hundred men,
09誌雌 14:3 and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
09誌雌 14:4 And between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp crag on the one side, and a sharp crag on the other side, and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
09誌雌 14:5 The one crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba.
09誌雌 14:6 Then Jonathan said to the young man who was carrying his armor, " Come and let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the LORD will work for us, for the LORD is not restrained to save by many or by few. "
09誌雌 14:7 And his armor bearer said to him, "Do all that is in your heart; turn yourself, [and] here I am with you according to your desire."
09誌雌 14:8 Then Jonathan said, "Behold, we will cross over to the men and reveal ourselves to them.
09誌雌 14:9 "If they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you'; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them.
09誌雌 14:10 "But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hands; and this shall be the sign to us."
09誌雌 14:11 And when both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, "Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves."
09誌雌 14:12 So the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor bearer and said, "Come up to us and we will tell you something." And Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hands of Israel."
09誌雌 14:13 Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer behind him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put some to death after him.
09誌雌 14:14 And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land.
09誌雌 14:15 And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a great trembling.
09誌雌 14:16 Now Saul's watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away; and they went here and [there.]
09誌雌 14:17 And Saul said to the people who [were] with him, "Number now and see who has gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not [there.]
09誌雌 14:18 Then Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God here." For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel.
09誌雌 14:19 And it happened while Saul talked to the priest, that the commotion in the camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
09誌雌 14:20 Then Saul and all the people who [were] with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, [and there was] very great confusion.
09誌雌 14:21 Now the Hebrews [who] were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites who [were] with Saul and Jonathan.
09誌雌 14:22 When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, even they also pursued them closely in the battle.
09誌雌 14:23 So the LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven.
09誌雌 14:24 Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under oath, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and until I have avenged myself on my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.
09誌雌 14:25 And all [the people of] the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.
09誌雌 14:26 When the people entered the forest, behold, [there was] a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
09誌雌 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under oath; therefore, he put out the end of the staff that [was] in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
09誌雌 14:28 Then one of the people answered and said, "Your father strictly put the people under oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food today.'" And the people were weary.
09誌雌 14:29 Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
09誌雌 14:30 "How much more, if only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great."
09誌雌 14:31 And they struck among the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very weary.
09誌雌 14:32 And the people rushed greedily upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew [them] on the ground; and the people ate [them] with the blood.
09誌雌 14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have acted treacherously; roll a great stone to me today."
09誌雌 14:34 And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, 'Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter [it] here and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So all the people that night brought each one his ox with him, and slaughtered [it] there.
09誌雌 14:35 And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
09誌雌 14:36 Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." So the priest said, "Let us draw near to God here."
09誌雌 14:37 And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt Thou give them into the hand of Israel?" But He did not answer him on that day.
09誌雌 14:38 And Saul said, "Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and investigate and see how this sin has happened today.
09誌雌 14:39 "For as the LORD lives, who delivers Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But not one of all the people answered him.
09誌雌 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
09誌雌 14:41 Therefore, Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give a perfect [lot.]" And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.
09誌雌 14:42 And Saul said, "Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.
09誌雌 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him and said, "I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!"
09誌雌 14:44 And Saul said, "May God do this [to me] and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan."
09誌雌 14:45 But the people said to Saul, "Must Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day." So the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die.
09誌雌 14:46 Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
09誌雌 14:47 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment.
09誌雌 14:48 And he acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.
09誌雌 14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishvi and Malchi-shua; and the names of his two daughters [were these:] the name of the first-born Merab and the name of the younger Michal.
09誌雌 14:50 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
09誌雌 14:51 And Kish [was] the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner [was] the son of Abiel.
09誌雌 14:52 Now the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he attached him to his staff.
09誌雌 15:1 Then Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD.
09誌雌 15:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish Amalek [for] what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt.
09誌雌 15:3 'Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.' "
09誌雌 15:4 Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, 2000000 foot soldiers and 100000 men of Judah.
09誌雌 15:5 And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley.
09誌雌 15:6 And Saul said to the Kenites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
09誌雌 15:7 So Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt.
09誌雌 15:8 And he captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
09誌雌 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.
09誌雌 15:10 Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,
09誌雌 15:11 "I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not carried out My commands." And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night.
09誌雌 15:12 And Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal."
09誌雌 15:13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed are you of the LORD! I have carried out the command of the LORD."
09誌雌 15:14 But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
09誌雌 15:15 And Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed."
09誌雌 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait, and let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." And he said to him, "Speak!"
09誌雌 15:17 And Samuel said, "Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were [made] the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel,
09誌雌 15:18 and the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, 'Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated.'
09誌雌 15:19 "Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
09誌雌 15:20 Then Saul said to Samuel, "I did obey the voice of the LORD, and went on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
09誌雌 15:21 "But the people took [some] of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
09誌雌 15:22 And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, [And] to heed than the fat of rams.
09誌雌 15:23 "For rebellion is as the sin of divination, And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from [being] king."
09誌雌 15:24 Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.
09誌雌 15:25 "Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship the LORD."
09誌雌 15:26 But Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
09誌雌 15:27 And as Samuel turned to go, [Saul] seized the edge of his robe, and it tore.
09誌雌 15:28 So Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.
09誌雌 15:29 "And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind."
09誌雌 15:30 Then he said, "I have sinned; [but] please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, that I may worship the LORD your God."
09誌雌 15:31 So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
09誌雌 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
09誌雌 15:33 But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
09誌雌 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.
09誌雌 15:35 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death; for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
09誌雌 16:1 Now the LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected a king for Myself among his sons."
09誌雌 16:2 But Samuel said, "How can I go? When Saul hears [of it,] he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
09誌雌 16:3 "And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate to you."
09誌雌 16:4 So Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, "Do you come in peace?"
09誌雌 16:5 And he said, "In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." He also consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
09誌雌 16:6 Then it came about when they entered, that he looked at Eliab and thought, "Surely the Lord's anointed is before Him."
09誌雌 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God [sees] not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."
09誌雌 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
09誌雌 16:9 Next Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
09誌雌 16:10 Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
09誌雌 16:11 And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are these all the children?" And he said, "There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is tending the sheep." Then Samuel said to Jesse," Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here. "
09誌雌 16:12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he."
09誌雌 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
09誌雌 16:14 Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrorized him.
09誌雌 16:15 Saul's servants then said to him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from God is terrorizing you.
09誌雌 16:16 "Let our lord now command your servants who are before you. Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall come about when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play [the harp] with his hand, and you will be well."
09誌雌 16:17 So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me now a man who can play well, and bring [him] to me."
09誌雌 16:18 Then one of the young men answered and said, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a mighty man of valor, a warrior, one prudent in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him."
09誌雌 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me your son David who is with the flock."
09誌雌 16:20 And Jesse took a donkey [loaded with] bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent [them] to Saul by David his son.
09誌雌 16:21 Then David came to Saul and attended him, and Saul loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.
09誌雌 16:22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David now stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
09誌雌 16:23 So it came about whenever the [evil] spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play [it] with his hand; and Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would depart from him.
09誌雌 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
09誌雌 17:2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines.
09誌雌 17:3 And the Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.
09誌雌 17:4 Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
09誌雌 17:5 And [he had] a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.
09誌雌 17:6 [He] also [had] bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze javelin [slung] between his shoulders.
09誌雌 17:7 And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron; his shield-carrier also walked before him.
09誌雌 17:8 And he stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, and said to them, " Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.
09誌雌 17:9 "If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us."
09誌雌 17:10 Again the Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together."
09誌雌 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
09誌雌 17:12 Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced [in years] among men.
09誌雌 17:13 And the three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
09誌雌 17:14 And David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,
09誌雌 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock at Bethlehem.
09誌雌 17:16 And the Philistine came forward morning and evening for forty days, and took his stand.
09誌雌 17:17 Then Jesse said to David his son, "Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to your brothers.
09誌雌 17:18 "Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of [their] thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news of them.
09誌雌 17:19 "For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
09誌雌 17:20 So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took [the supplies] and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the circle of the camp while the army was going out in battle array shouting the war cry.
09誌雌 17:21 And Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army.
09誌雌 17:22 Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers.
09誌雌 17:23 As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard [them].
09誌雌 17:24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid.
09誌雌 17:25 And the men of Israel said, "Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel."
09誌雌 17:26 Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?"
09誌雌 17:27 And the people answered him in accord with this word, saying, "Thus it will be done for the man who kills him."
09誌雌 17:28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, "Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle."
09誌雌 17:29 But David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"
09誌雌 17:30 Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before.
09誌雌 17:31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they told [them] to Saul, and he sent for him.
09誌雌 17:32 And David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
09誌雌 17:33 Then Saul said to David, "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are [but] a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth."
09誌雌 17:34 But David said to Saul, "Your servant was tending his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,
09誌雌 17:35 I went out after him and attacked him, and rescued [it] from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized [him] by his beard and struck him and killed him.
09誌雌 17:36 "Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God."
09誌雌 17:37 And David said, "The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David, "Go, and may the LORD be with you."
09誌雌 17:38 Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor.
09誌雌 17:39 And David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested [them.] So David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these, for I have not tested [them]." And David took them off.
09誌雌 17:40 And he took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in [his] pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.
09誌雌 17:41 Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him.
09誌雌 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was [but] a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.
09誌雌 17:43 And the Philistine said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
09誌雌 17:44 The Philistine also said to David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field."
09誌雌 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, "You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted.
09誌雌 17:46 "This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
09誌雌 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands. "
09誌雌 17:48 Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
09誌雌 17:49 And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung [it], and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground.
09誌雌 17:50 Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand.
09誌雌 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
09誌雌 17:52 And the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron.
09誌雌 17:53 And the sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps.
09誌雌 17:54 Then David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.
09誌雌 17:55 Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" And Abner said, "By your life, O king, I do not know."
09誌雌 17:56 And the king said, "You inquire whose son the youth is."
09誌雌 17:57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand.
09誌雌 17:58 And Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" And David answered, "[I am] the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
09誌雌 18:1 Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.
09誌雌 18:2 And Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house.
09誌雌 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
09誌雌 18:4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt.
09誌雌 18:5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
09誌雌 18:6 And it happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical instruments.
09誌雌 18:7 And the women sang as they played, and said, "Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands."
09誌雌 18:8 Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, "They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?"
09誌雌 18:9 And Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.
09誌雌 18:10 Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing [the harp] with his hand, as usual; and a spear [was] in Saul's hand.
09誌雌 18:11 And Saul hurled the spear for he thought, "I will pin David to the wall." But David escaped from his presence twice.
09誌雌 18:12 Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.
09誌雌 18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
09誌雌 18:14 And David was prospering in all his ways for the LORD [was] with him.
09誌雌 18:15 When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him.
09誌雌 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them.
09誌雌 18:17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the Lord's battles." For Saul thought, "My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him."
09誌雌 18:18 But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my life [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law?"
09誌雌 18:19 So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.
09誌雌 18:20 Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to him.
09誌雌 18:21 And Saul thought, "I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David, "For a second time you may be my son-in-law today."
09誌雌 18:22 Then Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king's son-in-law.'"
09誌雌 18:23 So Saul's servants spoke these words to David. But David said, "Is it trivial in your sight to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?"
09誌雌 18:24 And the servants of Saul reported to him according to these words [ which] David spoke.
09誌雌 18:25 Saul then said, "Thus you shall say to David, 'The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king's enemies.'" Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
09誌雌 18:26 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David to become the king's son-in-law. Before the days had expired
09誌雌 18:27 David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.
09誌雌 18:28 When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and [that] Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,
09誌雌 18:29 then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David's enemy continually.
09誌雌 18:30 Then the commanders of the Philistines went out [to battle], and it happened as often as they went out, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed.
09誌雌 19:1 Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, greatly delighted in David.
09誌雌 19:2 So Jonathan told David saying, "Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
09誌雌 19:3 "And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find out anything, then I shall tell you."
09誌雌 19:4 Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, "Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds [have been] very beneficial to you.
09誌雌 19:5 "For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw [it] and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, by putting David to death without a cause?"
09誌雌 19:6 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."
09誌雌 19:7 Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly.
09誌雌 19:8 When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines, and defeated them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him.
09誌雌 19:9 Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing [the harp] with [his] hand.
09誌雌 19:10 And Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.
09誌雌 19:11 Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, "If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death."
09誌雌 19:12 So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped.
09誌雌 19:13 And Michal took the household idol and laid [it] on the bed, and put a quilt of goats' [hair] at its head, and covered [it] with clothes.
09誌雌 19:14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."
09誌雌 19:15 Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me on his bed, that I may put him to death."
09誌雌 19:16 When the messengers entered, behold, the household idol [was] on the bed with the quilt of goats' [hair] at its head.
09誌雌 19:17 So Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal said to Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I put you to death?'"
09誌雌 19:18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.
09誌雌 19:19 And it was told Saul, saying, "Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
09誌雌 19:20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing [and] presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied.
09誌雌 19:21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
09誌雌 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah, and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, "Where are Samuel and David?" And [someone] said, "Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
09誌雌 19:23 And he proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
09誌雌 19:24 And he also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
09誌雌 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?"
09誌雌 20:2 And he said to him, "Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!"
09誌雌 20:3 Yet David vowed again, saying, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly a step between me and death."
09誌雌 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."
09誌雌 20:5 So David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.
09誌雌 20:6 "If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked [ leave] of me to run to Bethlehem his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.'
09誌雌 20:7 "If he says, 'It is good,' your servant [shall be] safe; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided on evil.
09誌雌 20:8 "Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?"
09誌雌 20:9 And Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?"
09誌雌 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
09誌雌 20:11 And Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field." So both of them went out to the field.
09誌雌 20:12 Then Jonathan said to David, "The LORD, the God of Israel, [be witness]! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there is good [feeling] toward David, shall I not then send to you and make it known to you?
09誌雌 20:13 "If it please my father [to do] you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not make it known to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.
09誌雌 20:14 "And if I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the LORD, that I may not die?
09誌雌 20:15 "And you shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth."
09誌雌 20:16 So Jonathan made a [covenant] with the house of David, [saying], " May the LORD require [it] at the hands of David's enemies. "
09誌雌 20:17 And Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.
09誌雌 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty.
09誌雌 20:19 "When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel.
09誌雌 20:20 "And I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target.
09誌雌 20:21 "And behold, I will send the lad, [saying,] 'Go, find the arrows.' If I specifically say to the lad,' Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them, 'then come; for there is safety for you and no harm, as the LORD lives.
09誌雌 20:22 "But if I say to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' go, for the LORD has sent you away.
09誌雌 20:23 "As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever."
09誌雌 20:24 So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
09誌雌 20:25 And the king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.
09誌雌 20:26 Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, " It is an accident, he is not clean, surely [he is] not clean. "
09誌雌 20:27 And it came about the next day, the second [day] of the new moon, that David's place was empty; so Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
09誌雌 20:28 Jonathan then answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me [to go] to Bethlehem,
09誌雌 20:29 for he said, 'Please let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table. "
09誌雌 20:30 Then Saul's anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
09誌雌 20:31 "For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must surely die."
09誌雌 20:32 But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
09誌雌 20:33 Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.
09誌雌 20:34 Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him.
09誌雌 20:35 Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad [was] with him.
09誌雌 20:36 And he said to his lad, "Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot." As the lad was running, he shot an arrow past him.
09誌雌 20:37 When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad, and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"
09誌雌 20:38 And Jonathan called after the lad, "Hurry, be quick, do not stay!" And Jonathan's lad picked up the arrow and came to his master.
09誌雌 20:39 But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.
09誌雌 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, "Go, bring [them] to the city."
09誌雌 20:41 When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David more.
09誌雌 20:42 And Jonathan said to David, "Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.' " Then he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city.
09誌雌 21:1 Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, "Why are you alone and no one with you?"
09誌雌 21:2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king has commissioned me with a matter, and has said to me, 'Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.'
09誌雌 21:3 "Now therefore, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found."
09誌雌 21:4 And the priest answered David and said, "There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."
09誌雌 21:5 And David answered the priest and said to him, "Surely women have been kept from us as previously when I set out and the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels [be holy]?"
09誌雌 21:6 So the priest gave him consecrated [bread]; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread [in its place] when it was taken away.
09誌雌 21:7 Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.
09誌雌 21:8 And David said to Ahimelech, "Now is there not a spear or a sword on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's matter was urgent."
09誌雌 21:9 Then the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take [it.] For there is no other except it here." And David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
09誌雌 21:10 Then David arose and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath.
09誌雌 21:11 But the servants of Achish said to him, "Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying, ' Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands'?"
09誌雌 21:12 And David took these words to heart, and greatly feared Achish king of Gath.
09誌雌 21:13 So he disguised his sanity before them, and acted insanely in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into his beard.
09誌雌 21:14 Then Achish said to his servants, "Behold, you see the man behaving as a madman. Why do you bring him to me?
09誌雌 21:15 "Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this one to act the madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?"
09誌雌 22:1 So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's household heard [of it], they went down there to him.
09誌雌 22:2 And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered to him; and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him.
09誌雌 22:3 And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother come [and stay] with you until I know what God will do for me."
09誌雌 22:4 Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
09誌雌 22:5 And the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah." So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.
09誌雌 22:6 Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
09誌雌 22:7 And Saul said to his servants who stood around him, "Hear now, O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give to all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
09誌雌 22:8 "For all of you have conspired against me so that there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes [a covenant] with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as [it is] this day."
09誌雌 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered and said, "I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
09誌雌 22:10 "And he inquired of the LORD for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
09誌雌 22:11 Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king.
09誌雌 22:12 And Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." And he answered, "Here I am, my lord."
09誌雌 22:13 Saul then said to him, "Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise up against me by lying in ambush as [it is] this day?"
09誌雌 22:14 Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, "And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, even the king's son-in-law, who is captain over your guard, and is honored in your house?
09誌雌 22:15 "Did I [just] begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant [or] to any of the household of my father, for your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair."
09誌雌 22:16 But the king said, "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's household!"
09誌雌 22:17 And the king said to the guards who were attending him, "Turn around and put the priests of the LORD to death, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not reveal it to me." But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hands to attack the priests of the LORD.
09誌雌 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn around and attack the priests." And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
09誌雌 22:19 And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also oxen, donkeys, and sheep, [he struck] with the edge of the sword.
09誌雌 22:20 But one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
09誌雌 22:21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
09誌雌 22:22 Then David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have brought about [the death] of every person in your father's household.
09誌雌 22:23 "Stay with me, do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life; for you are safe with me."
09誌雌 23:1 Then they told David, saying, "Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are plundering the threshing floors."
09誌雌 23:2 So David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" And the LORD said to David, "Go and attack the Philistines, and deliver Keilah."
09誌雌 23:3 But David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?"
09誌雌 23:4 Then David inquired of the LORD once more. And the LORD answered him and said, "Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand."
09誌雌 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines; and he led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah.
09誌雌 23:6 Now it came about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an ephod in his hand.
09誌雌 23:7 When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, "God has delivered him into my hand, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars."
09誌雌 23:8 So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
09誌雌 23:9 Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; so he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here."
09誌雌 23:10 Then David said, "O LORD God of Israel, Thy servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my account.
09誌雌 23:11 "Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down just as Thy servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I pray, tell Thy servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."
09誌雌 23:12 Then David said, "Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will surrender you."
09誌雌 23:13 Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit.
09誌雌 23:14 And David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.
09誌雌 23:15 Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
09誌雌 23:16 And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God.
09誌雌 23:17 Thus he said to him, "Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father shall not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also."
09誌雌 23:18 So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; and David stayed at Horesh while Jonathan went to his house.
09誌雌 23:19 Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
09誌雌 23:20 "Now then, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to do so; and our part [shall be] to surrender him into the king's hand."
09誌雌 23:21 And Saul said, "May you be blessed of the LORD; for you have had compassion on me.
09誌雌 23:22 "Go now, make more sure, and investigate and see his place where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning.
09誌雌 23:23 "So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come about if he is in the land that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
09誌雌 23:24 Then they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.
09誌雌 23:25 When Saul and his men went to seek [him], they told David, and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard [it], he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
09誌雌 23:26 And Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them.
09誌雌 23:27 But a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land."
09誌雌 23:28 So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape.
09誌雌 23:29 And David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.
09誌雌 24:1 Now it came about when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, saying, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
09誌雌 24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
09誌雌 24:3 And he came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there [was] a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave.
09誌雌 24:4 And the men of David said to him, "Behold, [this is] the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'" Then David arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly.
09誌雌 24:5 And it came about afterward that David's conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of Saul's [robe].
09誌雌 24:6 So he said to his men, "Far be it from me because of the LORD that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the Lord's anointed."
09誌雌 24:7 And David persuaded his men with [these] words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul arose, left the cave, and went on [his] way.
09誌雌 24:8 Now afterward David arose and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.
09誌雌 24:9 And David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of men, saying, 'Behold, David seeks to harm you'?
09誌雌 24:10 "Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the LORD had given you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you, but [my eye] had pity on you; and I said, 'I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.'
09誌雌 24:11 "Now, my father, see! Indeed, see the edge of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the edge of your robe and did not kill you, know and perceive that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life to take it.
09誌雌 24:12 "May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you.
09誌雌 24:13 "As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness'; but my hand shall not be against you.
09誌雌 24:14 "After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea?
09誌雌 24:15 "The LORD therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause, and deliver me from your hand."
09誌雌 24:16 Now it came about when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
09誌雌 24:17 And he said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt wickedly with you.
09誌雌 24:18 "And you have declared today that you have done good to me, that the LORD delivered me into your hand and [yet] you did not kill me.
09誌雌 24:19 "For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely? May the LORD therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day.
09誌雌 24:20 "And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
09誌雌 24:21 "So now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father's household."
09誌雌 24:22 And David swore to Saul. And Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
09誌雌 25:1 Then Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
09誌雌 25:2 Now [there was] a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel
09誌雌 25:3 (now the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in [his] dealings, and he was a Calebite),
09誌雌 25:4 that David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
09誌雌 25:5 So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal and greet him in my name;
09誌雌 25:6 and thus you shall say, 'Have a long life, peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
09誌雌 25:7 'And now I have heard that you have shearers; now your shepherds have been with us and we have not insulted them, nor have they missed anything all the days they were in Carmel.
09誌雌 25:8 'Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let [my] young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a festive day. Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.' "
09誌雌 25:9 When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in David's name; then they waited.
09誌雌 25:10 But Nabal answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master.
09誌雌 25:11 "Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men whose origin I do not know?"
09誌雌 25:12 So David's young men retraced their way and went back; and they came and told him according to all these words.
09誌雌 25:13 And David said to his men, "Each [of you] gird on his sword." So each man girded on his sword. And David also girded on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed with the baggage.
09誌雌 25:14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he scorned them.
09誌雌 25:15 "Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not insulted, nor did we miss anything as long as we went about with them, while we were in the fields.
09誌雌 25:16 "They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep.
09誌雌 25:17 "Now therefore, know and consider what you should do, for evil is plotted against our master and against all his household; and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him."
09誌雌 25:18 Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred [loaves] of bread and two jugs of wine and five sheep already prepared and five measures of roasted grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded [them] on donkeys.
09誌雌 25:19 And she said to her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I am coming after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
09誌雌 25:20 And it came about as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain, that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them.
09誌雌 25:21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain I have guarded all that this [ man] has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good.
09誌雌 25:22 "May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave [as much as] one male of any who belong to him."
09誌雌 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and fell on her face before David, and bowed herself to the ground.
09誌雌 25:24 And she fell at his feet and said, "On me alone, my lord, be the blame. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant.
09誌雌 25:25 "Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name and folly is with him; but I your maidservant did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
09誌雌 25:26 "Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, since the LORD has restrained you from shedding blood, and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now then let your enemies, and those who seek evil against my lord, be as Nabal.
09誌雌 25:27 "And now let this gift which your maidservant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who accompany my lord.
09誌雌 25:28 "Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the LORD will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you all your days.
09誌雌 25:29 "And should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
09誌雌 25:30 "And it shall come about when the LORD shall do for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and shall appoint you ruler over Israel,
09誌雌 25:31 that this will not cause grief or a troubled heart to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the LORD shall deal well with my lord, then remember your maidservant. "
09誌雌 25:32 Then David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,
09誌雌 25:33 and blessed be your discernment, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed, and from avenging myself by my own hand.
09誌雌 25:34 "Nevertheless, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from harming you, unless you had come quickly to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal until the morning light [as much as] one male."
09誌雌 25:35 So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and he said to her, "Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request."
09誌雌 25:36 Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light.
09誌雌 25:37 But it came about in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him so that he became [as] a stone.
09誌雌 25:38 And about ten days later, it happened that the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
09誌雌 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD ,who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back His servant from evil. The LORD has also returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head." Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
09誌雌 25:40 When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, "David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife."
09誌雌 25:41 And she arose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, "Behold, your maidservant is a maid to wash the feet of my lord's servants."
09誌雌 25:42 Then Abigail quickly arose, and rode on a donkey, with her five maidens who attended her; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife.
09誌雌 25:43 David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.
09誌雌 25:44 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
09誌雌 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, [which is] before Jeshimon?"
09誌雌 26:2 So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.
09誌雌 26:3 And Saul camped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, beside the road, and David was staying in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,
09誌雌 26:4 David sent out spies, and he knew that Saul was definitely coming.
09誌雌 26:5 David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying in the circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him.
09誌雌 26:6 Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" And Abishai said, "I will go down with you."
09誌雌 26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him.
09誌雌 26:8 Then Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand; now therefore, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time."
09誌雌 26:9 But David said to Abishai, "Do not destroy him, for who can stretch out his hand against the Lord's anointed and be without guilt?"
09誌雌 26:10 David also said, "As the LORD lives, surely the LORD will strike him, or his day will come that he dies, or he will go down into battle and perish.
09誌雌 26:11 "The LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the Lord's anointed; but now please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go."
09誌雌 26:12 So David took the spear and the jug of water from [beside] Saul's head, and they went away, but no one saw or knew [it,] nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a sound sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.
09誌雌 26:13 Then David crossed over to the other side, and stood on top of the mountain at a distance [with] a large area between them.
09誌雌 26:14 And David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered and said, "Who are you who calls to the king?"
09誌雌 26:15 So David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy the king your lord.
09誌雌 26:16 "This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, [ all] of you must surely die, because you did not guard your lord, the Lord's anointed. And now, see where the king's spear is, and the jug of water that was at his head."
09誌雌 26:17 Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord the king."
09誌雌 26:18 He also said, "Why then is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?
09誌雌 26:19 "Now therefore, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering; but if it is men, cursed are they before the LORD, for they have driven me out today that I should have no attachment with the inheritance of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'
09誌雌 26:20 "Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
09誌雌 26:21 Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have committed a serious error."
09誌雌 26:22 And David answered and said, "Behold the spear of the king! Now let one of the young men come over and take it.
09誌雌 26:23 "And the LORD will repay each man [for] his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into [my] hand today, but I refused to stretch out my hand against the Lord's anointed.
09誌雌 26:24 "Now behold, as your life was highly valued in my sight this day, so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the LORD, and may He deliver me from all distress."
09誌雌 26:25 Then Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David; you will both accomplish much and surely prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
09誌雌 27:1 Then David said to himself, "Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape into the land of the Philistines. Saul then will despair of searching for me anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand."
09誌雌 27:2 So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
09誌雌 27:3 And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each with his household, [even] David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's widow.
09誌雌 27:4 Now it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him.
09誌雌 27:5 Then David said to Achish, "If now I have found favor in your sight, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
09誌雌 27:6 So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
09誌雌 27:7 And the number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
09誌雌 27:8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt.
09誌雌 27:9 And David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took away the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.
09誌雌 27:10 Now Achish said, "Where have you made a raid today?" And David said, "Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites."
09誌雌 27:11 And David did not leave a man or a woman alive, to bring to Gath, saying, "Lest they should tell about us, saying, 'So has David done and so [ has been] his practice all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.'"
09誌雌 27:12 So Achish believed David, saying, "He has surely made himself odious among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever."
09誌雌 28:1 Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, "Know assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men."
09誌雌 28:2 And David said to Achish, "Very well, you shall know what your servant can do." So Achish said to David, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
09誌雌 28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him and buried him in Ramah his own city. And Saul had removed from the land those who were mediums and spiritists.
09誌雌 28:4 So the Philistines gathered together and came and camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in Gilboa.
09誌雌 28:5 When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly.
09誌雌 28:6 When Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.
09誌雌 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, "Seek for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor."
09誌雌 28:8 Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, "Conjure up for me, please, and bring up for me whom I shall name to you."
09誌雌 28:9 But the woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?"
09誌雌 28:10 And Saul vowed to her by the LORD, saying, "As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment come upon you for this thing."
09誌雌 28:11 Then the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" And he said, " Bring up Samuel for me. "
09誌雌 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, "Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul."
09誌雌 28:13 And the king said to her, "Do not be afraid; but what do you see?" And the woman said to Saul," I see a divine being coming up out of the earth. "
09誌雌 28:14 And he said to her, "What is his form?" And she said, "An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe." And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage.
09誌雌 28:15 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" And Saul answered, "I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me and answers me no more, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do."
09誌雌 28:16 And Samuel said, "Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has departed from you and has become your adversary?
09誌雌 28:17 "And the LORD has done accordingly as He spoke through me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David.
09誌雌 28:18 "As you did not obey the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so the LORD has done this thing to you this day.
09誌雌 28:19 "Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines!"
09誌雌 28:20 Then Saul immediately fell full length upon the ground and was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; also there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day and all night.
09誌雌 28:21 And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified, and said to him, "Behold, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
09誌雌 28:22 "So now also, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you that [you may] eat and have strength when you go on [your] way."
09誌雌 28:23 But he refused and said, "I will not eat." However, his servants together with the woman urged him, and he listened to them. So he arose from the ground and sat on the bed.
09誌雌 28:24 And the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it; and she took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it.
09誌雌 28:25 And she brought [it] before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.
09誌雌 29:1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel.
09誌雌 29:2 And the lords of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish.
09誌雌 29:3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, "What [are] these Hebrews [doing here]?" And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, " Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather] these years, and I have found no fault in him from the day he deserted [to me] to this day? "
09誌雌 29:4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Make the man go back, that he may return to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what could this [man] make himself acceptable to his lord? [Would it] not [be] with the heads of these men?
09誌雌 29:5 "Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying, ' Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands'?"
09誌雌 29:6 Then Achish called David and said to him, "[As] the LORD lives, you [have been] upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army are pleasing in my sight; for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the lords.
09誌雌 29:7 "Now therefore return, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines."
09誌雌 29:8 And David said to Achish, "But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
09誌雌 29:9 But Achish answered and said to David, "I know that you are pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He must not go up with us to the battle.'
09誌雌 29:10 "Now then arise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you, and as soon as you have arisen early in the morning and have light, depart."
09誌雌 29:11 So David arose early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
09誌雌 30:1 Then it happened when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire;
09誌雌 30:2 and they took captive the women [and all] who were in it, both small and great, without killing anyone, and carried [them] off and went their way.
09誌雌 30:3 And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive.
09誌雌 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and wept until there was no strength in them to weep.
09誌雌 30:5 Now David's two wives had been taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.
09誌雌 30:6 Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
09誌雌 30:7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Please bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
09誌雌 30:8 And David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I pursue this band? Shall I overtake them?" And He said to him, "Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them, and you shall surely rescue [all]."
09誌雌 30:9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, [where] those left behind remained.
09誌雌 30:10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor, remained [behind.]
09誌雌 30:11 Now they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they provided him water to drink.
09誌雌 30:12 And they gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins, and he ate; then his spirit revived. For he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
09誌雌 30:13 And David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you from?" And he said, "I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind when I fell sick three days ago.
09誌雌 30:14 "We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire."
09誌雌 30:15 Then David said to him, "Will you bring me down to this band?" And he said, "Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band."
09誌雌 30:16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
09誌雌 30:17 And David slaughtered them from the twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.
09誌雌 30:18 So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives.
09誌雌 30:19 But nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken for themselves; David brought [it] all back.
09誌雌 30:20 So David had captured all the sheep and the cattle [which the people] drove ahead of the [other] livestock, and they said, "This is David's spoil."
09誌雌 30:21 When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow David, who had also been left at the brook Besor, and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him, then David approached the people and greeted them.
09誌雌 30:22 Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David answered and said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away and depart."
09誌雌 30:23 Then David said, "You must not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us, who has kept us and delivered into our hand the band that came against us.
09誌雌 30:24 "And who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike."
09誌雌 30:25 And so it has been from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
09誌雌 30:26 Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent [some] of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, "Behold, a gift for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD
09誌雌 30:27 to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir,
09誌雌 30:28 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
09誌雌 30:29 and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,
09誌雌 30:30 and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach,
09誌雌 30:31 and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go. "
09誌雌 31:1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
09誌雌 31:2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul.
09誌雌 31:3 And the battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers.
09誌雌 31:4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and pierce me through and make sport of me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it.
09誌雌 31:5 And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.
09誌雌 31:6 Thus Saul died with his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men on that day together.
09誌雌 31:7 And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, with those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; then the Philistines came and lived in them.
09誌雌 31:8 And it came about on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
09誌雌 31:9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his weapons, and sent [ them] throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people.
09誌雌 31:10 And they put his weapons in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
09誌雌 31:11 Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
09誌雌 31:12 all the valiant men rose and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh, and burned them there.
09誌雌 31:13 And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

10誌馬 1:1 Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David remained two days in Ziklag.
10誌馬 1:2 And it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn and dust on his head. And it came about when he came to David that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.
10誌馬 1:3 Then David said to him, "From where do you come?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."
10誌馬 1:4 And David said to him, "How did things go? Please tell me." And he said, "The people have fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10誌馬 1:5 So David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
10誌馬 1:6 And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely.
10誌馬 1:7 "And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, 'Here I am.'
10誌馬 1:8 "And he said to me, 'Who are you?' And I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
10誌馬 1:9 "Then he said to me, 'Please stand beside me and kill me; for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.'
10誌馬 1:10 "So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which [was] on his head and the bracelet which [was] on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."
10誌馬 1:11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and [so] also [ did] all the men who [were] with him.
10誌馬 1:12 And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
10誌馬 1:13 And David said to the young man who told him, "Where are you from?" And he answered," I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite. "
10誌馬 1:14 Then David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?"
10誌馬 1:15 And David called one of the young men and said, "Go, cut him down." So he struck him and he died.
10誌馬 1:16 And David said to him, "Your blood is on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the Lord's anointed.'"
10誌馬 1:17 Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Jonathan his son,
10誌馬 1:18 and he told [them] to teach the sons of Judah [the song of] the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar.
10誌馬 1:19 "Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How have the mighty fallen!
10誌馬 1:20 "Tell [it] not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
10誌馬 1:21 "O mountains of Gilboa, Let not dew or rain be on you, nor fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
10誌馬 1:22 "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty.
10誌馬 1:23 "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life, And in their death they were not parted; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.
10誌馬 1:24 "O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
10誌馬 1:25 "How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.
10誌馬 1:26 "I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful Than the love of women.
10誌馬 1:27 "How have the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!"
10誌馬 2:1 Then it came about afterwards that David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." So David said, "Where shall I go up?" And He said, "To Hebron."
10誌馬 2:2 So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.
10誌馬 2:3 And David brought up his men who [were] with him, each with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
10誌馬 2:4 Then the men of Judah came and there anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul."
10誌馬 2:5 And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, "May you be blessed of the LORD because you have shown this kindness to Saul your lord, and have buried him.
10誌馬 2:6 "And now may the LORD show lovingkindness and truth to you; and I also will show this goodness to you, because you have done this thing.
10誌馬 2:7 "Now therefore, let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
10誌馬 2:8 But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.
10誌馬 2:9 And he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, even over all Israel.
10誌馬 2:10 Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he was king for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.
10誌馬 2:11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
10誌馬 2:12 Now Abner the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon with the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul.
10誌馬 2:13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.
10誌馬 2:14 Then Abner said to Joab, "Now let the young men arise and hold a contest before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise."
10誌馬 2:15 So they arose and went over by count, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
10誌馬 2:16 And each one of them seized his opponent by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
10誌馬 2:17 And that day the battle was very severe, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
10誌馬 2:18 Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel; and Asahel [was as] swift-footed as one of the gazelles which is in the field.
10誌馬 2:19 And Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following Abner.
10誌馬 2:20 Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is that you, Asahel?" And he answered, "It is I."
10誌馬 2:21 So Abner said to him, "Turn to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take for yourself his spoil." But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from following him.
10誌馬 2:22 And Abner repeated again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?"
10誌馬 2:23 However, he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died on the spot. And it came about that all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
10誌馬 2:24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and when the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
10誌馬 2:25 And the sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one band, and they stood on the top of a certain hill.
10誌馬 2:26 Then Abner called to Joab and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will you refrain from telling the people to turn back from following their brothers?"
10誌馬 2:27 And Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then the people would have gone away in the morning, each from following his brother."
10誌馬 2:28 So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore.
10誌馬 2:29 Abner and his men then went through the Arabah all that night; so they crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim.
10誌馬 2:30 Then Joab returned from following Abner; when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David's servants besides Asahel were missing.
10誌馬 2:31 But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and sixty men died.
10誌馬 2:32 And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb which was in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men went all night until the day dawned at Hebron.
10誌馬 3:1 Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew steadily stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker continually.
10誌馬 3:2 Sons were born to David at Hebron his first-born was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
10誌馬 3:3 and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;
10誌馬 3:4 and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
10誌馬 3:5 and the sixth, Ithream, by David's wife Eglah. These were born to David at Hebron.
10誌馬 3:6 And it came about while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
10誌馬 3:7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
10誌馬 3:8 Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hands of David; and yet today you charge me with a guilt concerning the woman.
10誌馬 3:9 "May God do so to Abner, and more also, if as the LORD has sworn to David, I do not accomplish this for him,
10誌馬 3:10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba. "
10誌馬 3:11 And he could no longer answer Abner a word, because he was afraid of him.
10誌馬 3:12 Then Abner sent messengers to David in his place, saying, "Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you."
10誌馬 3:13 And he said, "Good! I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing of you, namely, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."
10誌馬 3:14 So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10誌馬 3:15 And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from [her] husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.
10誌馬 3:16 But her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return." So he returned.
10誌馬 3:17 Now Abner had consultation with the elders of Israel, saying, "In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you.
10誌馬 3:18 "Now then, do [it]! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, 'By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
10誌馬 3:19 And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin; and in addition Abner went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.
10誌馬 3:20 Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
10誌馬 3:21 And Abner said to David, "Let me arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that your soul desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
10誌馬 3:22 And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
10誌馬 3:23 When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, saying, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace."
10誌馬 3:24 Then Joab came to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you sent him away and he is already gone?
10誌馬 3:25 "You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to learn of your going out and coming in, and to find out all that you are doing."
10誌馬 3:26 When Joab came out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know [it].
10誌馬 3:27 So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother.
10誌馬 3:28 And afterward when David heard it, he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
10誌馬 3:29 "May it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father's house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who takes hold of a distaff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread."
10誌馬 3:30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
10誌馬 3:31 Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, " Tear your clothes and gird on sackcloth and lament before Abner. "And King David walked behind the bier.
10誌馬 3:32 Thus they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
10誌馬 3:33 And the king chanted a [lament] for Abner and said, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?
10誌馬 3:34 "Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters; As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him.
10誌馬 3:35 Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was still day; but David vowed, saying, "May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down."
10誌馬 3:36 Now all the people took note [of it,] and it pleased them, just as everything the king did pleased all the people.
10誌馬 3:37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been [the will] of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.
10誌馬 3:38 Then the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
10誌馬 3:39 "And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too difficult for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil."
10誌馬 4:1 Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was disturbed.
10誌馬 4:2 And Saul's son [had] two men who were commanders of bands the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered [part] of Benjamin,
10誌馬 4:3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been aliens there until this day).
10誌馬 4:4 Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
10誌馬 4:5 So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, departed and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest.
10誌馬 4:6 And they came to the middle of the house as if to get wheat, and they struck him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
10誌馬 4:7 Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and killed him and beheaded him. And they took his head and traveled by way of the Arabah all night.
10誌馬 4:8 Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, "Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the LORD has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants."
10誌馬 4:9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,
10誌馬 4:10 when one told me, saying, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for [his] news.
10誌馬 4:11 "How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hand, and destroy you from the earth?"
10誌馬 4:12 Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet, and hung them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
10誌馬 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
10誌馬 5:2 "Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and in. And the LORD said to you, 'You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a ruler over Israel.'"
10誌馬 5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them before the LORD at Hebron; then they anointed David king over Israel.
10誌馬 5:4 David was thirty years old when he became king, [and] he reigned forty years.
10誌馬 5:5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
10誌馬 5:6 Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, and they said to David, "You shall not come in here, but the blind and lame shall turn you away"; thinking, "David cannot enter here."
10誌馬 5:7 Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion, that is the city of David.
10誌馬 5:8 And David said on that day, "Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him reach the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul, through the water tunnel." Therefore they say, "The blind or the lame shall not come into the house."
10誌馬 5:9 So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.
10誌馬 5:10 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him.
10誌馬 5:11 Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David.
10誌馬 5:12 And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
10誌馬 5:13 Meanwhile David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.
10誌馬 5:14 Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
10誌馬 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
10誌馬 5:16 Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
10誌馬 5:17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard [of it,] he went down to the stronghold.
10誌馬 5:18 Now the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 5:19 Then David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt Thou give them into my hand?" And the LORD said to David, "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."
10誌馬 5:20 So David came to Baal-perazim, and defeated them there; and he said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters." Therefore he named that place Baal-perazim.
10誌馬 5:21 And they abandoned their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.
10誌馬 5:22 Now the Philistines came up once again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 5:23 And when David inquired of the LORD, He said, "You shall not go [ directly] up; circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees.
10誌馬 5:24 "And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act promptly, for then the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
10誌馬 5:25 Then David did so, just as the LORD had commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.
10誌馬 6:1 Now David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
10誌馬 6:2 And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name, the very name of the LORD of hosts who is enthroned [above] the cherubim.
10誌馬 6:3 And they placed the ark of God on a new cart that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.
10誌馬 6:4 So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking ahead of the ark.
10誌馬 6:5 Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of [instruments made of] fir wood, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets and cymbals.
10誌馬 6:6 But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset [it.]
10誌馬 6:7 And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God.
10誌馬 6:8 And David became angry because of the Lord's outburst against Uzzah, and that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day.
10誌馬 6:9 So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, "How can the ark of the LORD come to me?"
10誌馬 6:10 And David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the city of David with him; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
10誌馬 6:11 Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
10誌馬 6:12 Now it was told King David, saying, "The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God." And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.
10誌馬 6:13 And so it was, that when the bearers of the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
10誌馬 6:14 And David was dancing before the LORD with all [his] might, and David was wearing a linen ephod.
10誌馬 6:15 So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sound of the trumpet.
10誌馬 6:16 Then it happened [as] the ark of the LORD came into the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
10誌馬 6:17 So they brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
10誌馬 6:18 And when David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
10誌馬 6:19 Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread and one of dates and one of raisins to each one. Then all the people departed each to his house.
10誌馬 6:20 But when David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How the king of Israel distinguished himself today! He uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants' maids as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!"
10誌馬 6:21 So David said to Michal, "[It was] before the LORD, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel; therefore I will celebrate before the LORD.
10誌馬 6:22 "And I will be more lightly esteemed than this and will be humble in my own eyes, but with the maids of whom you have spoken, with them I will be distinguished."
10誌馬 6:23 And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.
10誌馬 7:1 Now it came about when the king lived in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,
10誌馬 7:2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains."
10誌馬 7:3 And Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your mind, for the LORD is with you."
10誌馬 7:4 But it came about in the same night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
10誌馬 7:5 "Go and say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD," Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in?
10誌馬 7:6 "For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle.
10誌馬 7:7 "Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'" '
10誌馬 7:8 "Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over My people Israel.
10誌馬 7:9 "And I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth.
10誌馬 7:10 "I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly,
10誌馬 7:11 even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you.
10誌馬 7:12 "When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom.
10誌馬 7:13 "He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
10誌馬 7:14 "I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,
10誌馬 7:15 but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took [it] away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
10誌馬 7:16 "And your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever." '"
10誌馬 7:17 In accordance with all these words and all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
10誌馬 7:18 Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD, and he said, "Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me this far?
10誌馬 7:19 "And yet this was insignificant in Thine eyes, O Lord GOD, for Thou hast spoken also of the house of Thy servant concerning the distant future. And this is the custom of man, O Lord GOD.
10誌馬 7:20 "And again what more can David say to Thee? For Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord GOD!
10誌馬 7:21 "For the sake of Thy word, and according to Thine own heart, Thou hast done all this greatness to let Thy servant know.
10誌馬 7:22 "For this reason Thou art great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like Thee, and there is no God besides Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
10誌馬 7:23 "And what one nation on the earth is like Thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do a great thing for Thee and awesome things for Thy land, before Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed for Thyself from Egypt, [from] nations and their gods?
10誌馬 7:24 "For Thou hast established for Thyself Thy people Israel as Thine own people forever, and Thou, O LORD, hast become their God.
10誌馬 7:25 "Now therefore, O LORD God, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and his house, confirm [it] forever, and do as Thou hast spoken,
10誌馬 7:26 that Thy name may be magnified forever, by saying, 'The LORD of hosts is God over Israel'; and may the house of Thy servant David be established before Thee.
10誌馬 7:27 "For Thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast made a revelation to Thy servant, saying, 'I will build you a house'; therefore Thy servant has found courage to pray this prayer to Thee.
10誌馬 7:28 "And now, O Lord GOD, Thou art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing to Thy servant.
10誌馬 7:29 "Now therefore, may it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue forever before Thee. For Thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken; and with Thy blessing may the house of Thy servant be blessed forever."
10誌馬 8:1 Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines.
10誌馬 8:2 And he defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.
10誌馬 8:3 Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his rule at the River.
10誌馬 8:4 And David captured from him 17000 horsemen and 200000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung the chariot horses, but reserved [enough] of them for 100 chariots.
10誌馬 8:5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed 220000 Arameans.
10誌馬 8:6 Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went.
10誌馬 8:7 And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 8:8 And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze.
10誌馬 8:9 Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer,
10誌馬 8:10 Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And [Joram] brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze.
10誌馬 8:11 King David also dedicated these to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued
10誌馬 8:12 from Aram and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
10誌馬 8:13 So David made a name [for himself] when he returned from killing 180000 Arameans in the Valley of Salt.
10誌馬 8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went.
10誌馬 8:15 So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people.
10誌馬 8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah [was] over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] recorder.
10誌馬 8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar [were] priests, and Seraiah [was] secretary.
10誌馬 8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
10誌馬 9:1 Then David said, "Is there yet anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
10誌馬 9:2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" And he said, "[I am] your servant."
10誌馬 9:3 And the king said, "Is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?" And Ziba said to the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet."
10誌馬 9:4 So the king said to him, "Where is he?" And Ziba said to the king, " Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debar. "
10誌馬 9:5 Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
10誌馬 9:6 And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, "Mephibosheth." And he said, "Here is your servant!"
10誌馬 9:7 And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly."
10誌馬 9:8 Again he prostrated himself and said, "What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?"
10誌馬 9:9 Then the king called Saul's servant Ziba, and said to him, "All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson.
10誌馬 9:10 "And you and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in [the produce] so that your master's grandson may have food; nevertheless Mephibosheth your master's grandson shall eat at my table regularly." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
10誌馬 9:11 Then Ziba said to the king, "According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your servant will do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons.
10誌馬 9:12 And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
10誌馬 9:13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king's table regularly. Now he was lame in both feet.
10誌馬 10:1 Now it happened afterwards that the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son became king in his place.
10誌馬 10:2 Then David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent some of his servants to console him concerning his father. But when David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites,
10誌馬 10:3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent consolers to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?"
10誌馬 10:4 So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away.
10誌馬 10:5 When they told [it] to David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, "Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and [then] return."
10誌馬 10:6 Now when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 200000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 10000 men, and the men of Tob with 120000 men.
10誌馬 10:7 When David heard [of it,] he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men.
10誌馬 10:8 And the sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah [were] by themselves in the field.
10誌馬 10:9 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel, and arrayed [ them] against the Arameans.
10誌馬 10:10 But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed [them] against the sons of Ammon.
10誌馬 10:11 And he said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you.
10誌馬 10:12 "Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight."
10誌馬 10:13 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him.
10誌馬 10:14 When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they [also] fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from [fighting] against the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 10:15 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
10誌馬 10:16 And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer led them.
10誌馬 10:17 Now when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans arrayed themselves to meet David and fought against him.
10誌馬 10:18 But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 charioteers of the Arameans and 400000 horsemen and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.
10誌馬 10:19 When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
10誌馬 11:1 Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out [to battle,] that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.
10誌馬 11:2 Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king's house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance.
10誌馬 11:3 So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10誌馬 11:4 And David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house.
10誌馬 11:5 And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, "I am pregnant."
10誌馬 11:6 Then David sent to Joab, [saying,] "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David.
10誌馬 11:7 When Uriah came to him, David asked concerning the welfare of Joab and the people and the state of the war.
10誌馬 11:8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and a present from the king was sent out after him.
10誌馬 11:9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
10誌馬 11:10 Now when they told David, saying, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
10誌馬 11:11 And Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing."
10誌馬 11:12 Then David said to Uriah, "Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you go." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
10誌馬 11:13 Now David called him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord's servants, but he did not go down to his house.
10誌馬 11:14 Now it came about in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent [it] by the hand of Uriah.
10誌馬 11:15 And he had written in the letter, saying, "Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die."
10誌馬 11:16 So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there [were] valiant men.
10誌馬 11:17 And the men of the city went out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among David's servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died.
10誌馬 11:18 Then Joab sent and reported to David all the events of the war.
10誌馬 11:19 And he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have finished telling all the events of the war to the king,
10誌馬 11:20 and if it happens that the king's wrath rises and he says to you, ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
10誌馬 11:21 'Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?'-- then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.' "
10誌馬 11:22 So the messenger departed and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent him [to tell.]
10誌馬 11:23 And the messenger said to David, "The men prevailed against us and came out against us in the field, but we pressed them as far as the entrance of the gate.
10誌馬 11:24 "Moreover, the archers shot at your servants from the wall; so some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead."
10誌馬 11:25 Then David said to the messenger, "Thus you shall say to Joab, 'Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle against the city stronger and overthrow it'; and [ so] encourage him."
10誌馬 11:26 Now when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
10誌馬 11:27 When the [time of] mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house and she became his wife; then she bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD.
10誌馬 12:1 Then the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said, "There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor.
10誌馬 12:2 "The rich man had a great many flocks and herds.
10誌馬 12:3 "But the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb Which he bought and nourished; And it grew up together with him and his children. It would eat of his bread and drink of his cup and lie in his bosom, And was like a daughter to him.
10誌馬 12:4 "Now a traveler came to the rich man, And he was unwilling to take from his own flock or his own herd, To prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him; Rather he took the poor man's ewe lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him."
10誌馬 12:5 Then David's anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, surely the man who has done this deserves to die.
10誌馬 12:6 "And he must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and had no compassion."
10誌馬 12:7 Nathan then said to David, "You are the man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'It is I who anointed you king over Israel and it is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul.
10誌馬 12:8 'I also gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and if [that had been] too little, I would have added to you many more things like these!
10誌馬 12:9 'Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
10誌馬 12:10 'Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'
10誌馬 12:11 "Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before your eyes, and give [them] to your companion, and he shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.
10誌馬 12:12 'Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and under the sun.' "
10誌馬 12:13 Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has taken away your sin; you shall not die.
10誌馬 12:14 "However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die."
10誌馬 12:15 So Nathan went to his house. Then the LORD struck the child that Uriah's widow bore to David, so that he was [very] sick.
10誌馬 12:16 David therefore inquired of God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.
10誌馬 12:17 And the elders of his household stood beside him in order to raise him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them.
10誌馬 12:18 Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Behold, while the child was [still] alive, we spoke to him and he did not listen to our voice. How then can we tell him that the child is dead, since he might do [himself] harm!"
10誌馬 12:19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" And they said, "He is dead."
10誌馬 12:20 So David arose from the ground, washed, anointed [himself,] and changed his clothes; and he came into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he came to his own house, and when he requested, they set food before him and he ate.
10誌馬 12:21 Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept; but when the child died, you arose and ate food."
10誌馬 12:22 And he said, "While the child was [still] alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows, the LORD may be gracious to me, that the child may live.'
10誌馬 12:23 "But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
10誌馬 12:24 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved him
10誌馬 12:25 and sent [word] through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah for the Lord's sake.
10誌馬 12:26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the royal city.
10誌馬 12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah, I have even captured the city of waters.
10誌馬 12:28 "Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and camp against the city and capture it, lest I capture the city myself and it be named after me."
10誌馬 12:29 So David gathered all the people and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.
10誌馬 12:30 Then he took the crown of their king from his head; and its weight [was] a talent of gold, and [in it was] a precious stone; and it was [ placed] on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city in great amounts.
10誌馬 12:31 He also brought out the people who were in it, and set [them] under saws, sharp iron instruments, and iron axes, and made them pass through the brickkiln. And thus he did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned [to] Jerusalem.
10誌馬 13:1 Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her.
10誌馬 13:2 And Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
10誌馬 13:3 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
10誌馬 13:4 And he said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Then Amnon said to him, "I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom."
10誌馬 13:5 Jonadab then said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill; when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me [some] food to eat, and let her prepare the food in my sight, that I may see [it] and eat from her hand.'"
10誌馬 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
10誌馬 13:7 Then David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, "Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."
10誌馬 13:8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, and he was lying down. And she took dough, kneaded [it,] made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
10誌馬 13:9 And she took the pan and dished [them] out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Have everyone go out from me." So everyone went out from him.
10誌馬 13:10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand." So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.
10誌馬 13:11 When she brought [them] to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."
10誌馬 13:12 But she answered him, "No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing!
10誌馬 13:13 "As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you."
10誌馬 13:14 However, he would not listen to her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
10誌馬 13:15 Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Get up, go away!"
10誌馬 13:16 But she said to him, "No, because this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!" Yet he would not listen to her.
10誌馬 13:17 Then he called his young man who attended him and said, "Now throw this woman out of my [presence,] and lock the door behind her."
10誌馬 13:18 Now she had on a long-sleeved garment; for in this manner the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her.
10誌馬 13:19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her long-sleeved garment which [was] on her; and she put her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
10誌馬 13:20 Then Absalom her brother said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart." So Tamar remained and was desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
10誌馬 13:21 Now when King David heard of all these matters, he was very angry.
10誌馬 13:22 But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
10誌馬 13:23 Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
10誌馬 13:24 And Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant."
10誌馬 13:25 But the king said to Absalom, "No, my son, we should not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." Although he urged him, he would not go, but blessed him.
10誌馬 13:26 Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"
10誌馬 13:27 But when Absalom urged him, he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
10誌馬 13:28 And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, "See now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then put him to death. Do not fear; have not I myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant."
10誌馬 13:29 And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose and each mounted his mule and fled.
10誌馬 13:30 Now it was while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left."
10誌馬 13:31 Then the king arose, tore his clothes and lay on the ground; and all his servants were standing by with clothes torn.
10誌馬 13:32 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, responded, "Do not let my lord suppose they have put to death all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead; because by the intent of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he violated his sister Tamar.
10誌馬 13:33 "Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely, 'all the king's sons are dead,' for only Amnon is dead."
10誌馬 13:34 Now Absalom had fled. And the young man who was the watchman raised his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.
10誌馬 13:35 And Jonadab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons have come; according to your servant's word, so it happened."
10誌馬 13:36 And it came about as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king's sons came and lifted their voices and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.
10誌馬 13:37 Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
10誌馬 13:38 So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and was there three years.
10誌馬 13:39 And [the heart of] King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.
10誌馬 14:1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart [was inclined] toward Absalom.
10誌馬 14:2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there and said to her, "Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments now, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be like a woman who has been mourning for the dead many days;
10誌馬 14:3 then go to the king and speak to him in this manner. "So Joab put the words in her mouth.
10誌馬 14:4 Now when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, "Help, O king."
10誌馬 14:5 And the king said to her, "What is your trouble?" And she answered, " Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead.
10誌馬 14:6 "And your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled together in the field, and there was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him.
10誌馬 14:7 "Now behold, the whole family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and destroy the heir also.' Thus they will extinguish my coal which is left, so as to leave my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth."
10誌馬 14:8 Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."
10誌馬 14:9 And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, "O my lord, the king, the iniquity is on me and my father's house, but the king and his throne are guiltless."
10誌馬 14:10 So the king said, "Whoever speaks to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you anymore."
10誌馬 14:11 Then she said, "Please let the king remember the LORD your God, [ so that] the avenger of blood may not continue to destroy, lest they destroy my son." And he said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."
10誌馬 14:12 Then the woman said, "Please let your maidservant speak a word to my lord the king." And he said, "Speak."
10誌馬 14:13 And the woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, [in that] the king does not bring back his banished one.
10誌馬 14:14 "For we shall surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one may not be cast out from him.
10誌馬 14:15 "Now the reason I have come to speak this word to my lord the king is because the people have made me afraid; so your maidservant said, 'Let me now speak to the king, perhaps the king will perform the request of his maidservant.
10誌馬 14:16 'For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy both me and my son from the inheritance of God.'
10誌馬 14:17 "Then your maidservant said, 'Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And may the LORD your God be with you.'"
10誌馬 14:18 Then the king answered and said to the woman, "Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king please speak."
10誌馬 14:19 So the king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" And the woman answered and said, "As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant;
10誌馬 14:20 in order to change the appearance of things your servant Joab has done this thing. But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth. "
10誌馬 14:21 Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I will surely do this thing; go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom."
10誌馬 14:22 And Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself and blessed the king; then Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, O my lord, the king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant."
10誌馬 14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 14:24 However the king said, "Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face." So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king's face.
10誌馬 14:25 Now in all Israel was no one as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.
10誌馬 14:26 And when he cut the hair of his head (and it was at the end of every year that he cut [it,] for it was heavy on him so he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king's weight.
10誌馬 14:27 And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.
10誌馬 14:28 Now Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king's face.
10誌馬 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. So he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
10誌馬 14:30 Therefore he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
10誌馬 14:31 Then Joab arose, came to Absalom at his house and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
10誌馬 14:32 And Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent for you, saying, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say," Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me still to be there. "'Now therefore, let me see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death."
10誌馬 14:33 So when Joab came to the king and told him, he called for Absalom. Thus he came to the king and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.
10誌馬 15:1 Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men as runners before him.
10誌馬 15:2 And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way to the gate; and it happened that when any man had a suit to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, "From what city are you?" And he would say, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
10誌馬 15:3 Then Absalom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right, but no man listens to you on the part of the king."
10誌馬 15:4 Moreover, Absalom would say, "Oh that one would appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has any suit or cause could come to me, and I would give him justice."
10誌馬 15:5 And it happened that when a man came near to prostrate himself before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
10誌馬 15:6 And in this manner Absalom dealt with all Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole away the hearts of the men of Israel.
10誌馬 15:7 Now it came about at the end of forty years that Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
10誌馬 15:8 "For your servant vowed a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.'"
10誌馬 15:9 And the king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron.
10誌馬 15:10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ' Absalom is king in Hebron. '"
10誌馬 15:11 Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who were invited and went innocently, and they did not know anything.
10誌馬 15:12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.
10誌馬 15:13 Then a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."
10誌馬 15:14 And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, " Arise and let us flee, for [otherwise] none of us shall escape from Absalom. Go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down calamity on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword. "
10誌馬 15:15 Then the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants [ are ready to do] whatever my lord the king chooses."
10誌馬 15:16 So the king went out and all his household with him. But the king left ten concubines to keep the house.
10誌馬 15:17 And the king went out and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house.
10誌馬 15:18 Now all his servants passed on beside him, all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king.
10誌馬 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why will you also go with us? Return and remain with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile; [return] to your own place.
10誌馬 15:20 "You came [only] yesterday, and shall I today make you wander with us, while I go where I will? Return and take back your brothers; mercy and truth be with you."
10誌馬 15:21 But Ittai answered the king and said, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be."
10誌馬 15:22 Therefore David said to Ittai, "Go and pass over." So Ittai the Gittite passed over with all his men and all the little ones who [were] with him.
10誌馬 15:23 While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people passed over. The king also passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.
10誌馬 15:24 Now behold, Zadok also [came,] and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished passing from the city.
10誌馬 15:25 And the king said to Zadok, "Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the sight of the LORD, then He will bring me back again, and show me both it and His habitation.
10誌馬 15:26 "But if He should say thus, 'I have no delight in you,' behold, here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him."
10誌馬 15:27 The king said also to Zadok the priest, "Are you [not] a seer? Return to the city in peace and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
10誌馬 15:28 "See, I am going to wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me."
10誌馬 15:29 Therefore Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there.
10誌馬 15:30 And David went up the ascent of the [Mount of] Olives, and wept as he went, and his head was covered and he walked barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his head and went up weeping as they went.
10誌馬 15:31 Now someone told David, saying, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." And David said, "O LORD, I pray, make the counsel of Ahithophel foolishness."
10誌馬 15:32 It happened as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his coat torn, and dust on his head.
10誌馬 15:33 And David said to him, "If you pass over with me, then you will be a burden to me.
10誌馬 15:34 "But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so I will now be your servant,' then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
10誌馬 15:35 "And are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king's house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
10誌馬 15:36 "Behold their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send me everything that you hear."
10誌馬 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
10誌馬 16:1 Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them [were] two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine.
10誌馬 16:2 And the king said to Ziba, "Why do you have these?" And Ziba said, " The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine, for whoever is faint in the wilderness to drink. "
10誌馬 16:3 Then the king said, "And where is your master's son?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.'"
10誌馬 16:4 So the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours." And Ziba said, "I prostrate myself; let me find favor in your sight, O my lord, the king!"
10誌馬 16:5 When King David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out cursing continually as he came.
10誌馬 16:6 And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were at his right hand and at his left.
10誌馬 16:7 And thus Shimei said when he cursed, "Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, and worthless fellow!
10誌馬 16:8 "The LORD has returned upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. And behold, you are [taken] in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!"
10誌馬 16:9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now, and cut off his head."
10誌馬 16:10 But the king said, "What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the LORD has told him, 'Curse David,' then who shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
10誌馬 16:11 Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my son who came out from me seeks my life; how much more now this Benjamite? Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him.
10誌馬 16:12 "Perhaps the LORD will look on my affliction and return good to me instead of his cursing this day."
10誌馬 16:13 So David and his men went on the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside parallel with him and as he went he cursed, and cast stones and threw dust at him.
10誌馬 16:14 And the king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and he refreshed himself there.
10誌馬 16:15 Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
10誌馬 16:16 Now it came about when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, "[Long] live the king! [Long] live the king!"
10誌馬 16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
10誌馬 16:18 Then Hushai said to Absalom, "No! For whom the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will remain.
10誌馬 16:19 "And besides, whom should I serve? [Should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in your presence."
10誌馬 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your advice. What shall we do?"
10誌馬 16:21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened."
10誌馬 16:22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
10誌馬 16:23 And the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, [was] as if one inquired of the word of God; so was all the advice of Ahithophel [ regarded] by both David and Absalom.
10誌馬 17:1 Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Please let me choose 120000 men that I may arise and pursue David tonight.
10誌馬 17:2 "And I will come upon him while he is weary and exhausted and will terrify him so that all the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone,
10誌馬 17:3 and I will bring back all the people to you. The return of everyone depends on the man you seek; [then] all the people shall be at peace. "
10誌馬 17:4 So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
10誌馬 17:5 Then Absalom said, "Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say."
10誌馬 17:6 When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom said to him, "Ahithophel has spoken thus. Shall we carry out his plan? If not, you speak."
10誌馬 17:7 So Hushai said to Absalom, "This time the advice that Ahithophel has given is not good."
10誌馬 17:8 Moreover, Hushai said, "You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men and they are fierce, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. And your father is an expert in warfare, and will not spend the night with the people.
10誌馬 17:9 "Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the caves or in another place; and it will be when he falls on them at the first attack, that whoever hears [it] will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'
10誌馬 17:10 "And even the one who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men.
10誌馬 17:11 "But I counsel that all Israel be surely gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle.
10誌馬 17:12 "So we shall come to him in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left.
10誌馬 17:13 "And if he withdraws into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the valley until not even a small stone is found there."
10誌馬 17:14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel, in order that the LORD might bring calamity on Absalom.
10誌馬 17:15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, "This is what Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have counseled.
10誌馬 17:16 "Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, 'Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means cross over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be destroyed.'"
10誌馬 17:17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant would go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David, for they could not be seen entering the city.
10誌馬 17:18 But a lad did see them, and told Absalom; so the two of them departed quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it.
10誌馬 17:19 And the woman took a covering and spread it over the well's mouth and scattered grain on it, so that nothing was known.
10誌馬 17:20 Then Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house and said, " Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? "And the woman said to them," They have crossed the brook of water. "And when they searched and could not find [them,] they returned to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 17:21 And it came about after they had departed that they came up out of the well and went and told King David; and they said to David, "Arise and cross over the water quickly for thus Ahithophel has counseled against you."
10誌馬 17:22 Then David and all the people who [were] with him arose and crossed the Jordan; and by dawn not even one remained who had not crossed the Jordan.
10誌馬 17:23 Now when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] donkey and arose and went to his home, to his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; thus he died and was buried in the grave of his father.
10誌馬 17:24 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
10誌馬 17:25 And Absalom set Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
10誌馬 17:26 And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
10誌馬 17:27 Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
10誌馬 17:28 brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, parched [grain,] beans, lentils, parched [seeds,]
10誌馬 17:29 honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and for the people who [were] with him, to eat; for they said, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness."
10誌馬 18:1 Then David numbered the people who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
10誌馬 18:2 And David sent the people out, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, "I myself will surely go out with you also."
10誌馬 18:3 But the people said, "You should not go out; for if we indeed flee, they will not care about us, even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you [be ready] to help us from the city."
10誌馬 18:4 Then the king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and thousands.
10誌馬 18:5 And the king charged Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, "[Deal] gently for my sake with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard when the king charged all the commanders concerning Absalom.
10誌馬 18:6 Then the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
10誌馬 18:7 And the people of Israel were defeated there before the servants of David, and the slaughter there that day was great, 200000 men.
10誌馬 18:8 For the battle there was spread over the whole countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
10誌馬 18:9 Now Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. For Absalom was riding on [his] mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. And his head caught fast in the oak, so he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him kept going.
10誌馬 18:10 When a certain man saw [it,] he told Joab and said, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
10誌馬 18:11 Then Joab said to the man who had told him, "Now behold, you saw [ him!] Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? And I would have given you ten [pieces] of silver and a belt."
10誌馬 18:12 And the man said to Joab, "Even if I should receive a thousand [pieces of] silver in my hand, I would not put out my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, 'Protect for me the young man Absalom!'
10誌馬 18:13 "Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof."
10誌馬 18:14 Then Joab said, "I will not waste time here with you." So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
10誌馬 18:15 And ten young men who carried Joab's armor gathered around and struck Absalom and killed him.
10誌馬 18:16 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people.
10誌馬 18:17 And they took Absalom and cast him into a deep pit in the forest and erected over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his tent.
10誌馬 18:18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar which is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to preserve my name." So he named the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.
10誌馬 18:19 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, "Please let me run and bring the king news that the LORD has freed him from the hand of his enemies."
10誌馬 18:20 But Joab said to him, "You are not the man to carry news this day, but you shall carry news another day; however, you shall carry no news today because the king's son is dead."
10誌馬 18:21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.
10誌馬 18:22 Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to Joab, "But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite." And Joab said, " Why would you run, my son, since you will have no reward for going? "
10誌馬 18:23 "But whatever happens," [he said,] "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and passed up the Cushite.
10誌馬 18:24 Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running by himself.
10誌馬 18:25 And the watchman called and told the king. And the king said, "If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth." And he came nearer and nearer.
10誌馬 18:26 Then the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, "Behold, [another] man running by himself." And the king said, "This one also is bringing good news."
10誌馬 18:27 And the watchman said, "I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok." And the king said, "This is a good man and comes with good news."
10誌馬 18:28 And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, "All is well." And he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, " Blessed is the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king. "
10誌馬 18:29 And the king said, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent the king's servant, and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what [it was]."
10誌馬 18:30 Then the king said, "Turn aside and stand here." So he turned aside and stood still.
10誌馬 18:31 And behold, the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, "Let my lord the king receive good news, for the LORD has freed you this day from the hand of all those who rose up against you."
10誌馬 18:32 Then the king said to the Cushite, "Is it well with the young man Absalom?" And the Cushite answered, "Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil, be as that young man!"
10誌馬 18:33 And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And thus he said as he walked, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10誌馬 19:1 Then it was told Joab, "Behold, the king is weeping and mourns for Absalom."
10誌馬 19:2 And the victory that day was turned to mourning for all the people, for the people heard [it] said that day, "The king is grieved for his son."
10誌馬 19:3 So the people went by stealth into the city that day, as people who are humiliated steal away when they flee in battle.
10誌馬 19:4 And the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10誌馬 19:5 Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, "Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines,
10誌馬 19:6 by loving those who hate you, and by hating those who love you. For you have shown today that princes and servants are nothing to you; for I know this day that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.
10誌馬 19:7 "Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go out, surely not a man will pass the night with you, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now."
10誌馬 19:8 So the king arose and sat in the gate. When they told all the people, saying, "Behold, the king is sitting in the gate," then all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled, each to his tent.
10誌馬 19:9 And all the people were quarreling throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
10誌馬 19:10 "However, Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now then, why are you silent about bringing the king back?"
10誌馬 19:11 Then King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, " Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the word of all Israel has come to the king, [ even] to his house?
10誌馬 19:12 'You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?'
10誌馬 19:13 "And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.'"
10誌馬 19:14 Thus he turned the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so that they sent [word] to the king, [saying], "Return, you and all your servants."
10誌馬 19:15 The king then returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal in order to go to meet the king, to bring the king across the Jordan.
10誌馬 19:16 Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite who was from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
10誌馬 19:17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, with Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they rushed to the Jordan before the king.
10誌馬 19:18 Then they kept crossing the ford to bring over the king's household, and to do what was good in his sight. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan.
10誌馬 19:19 So he said to the king, "Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day when my lord the king came out from Jerusalem, so that the king should take [it] to heart.
10誌馬 19:20 "For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10誌馬 19:21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, "Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?"
10誌馬 19:22 David then said, "What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be an adversary to me? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?"
10誌馬 19:23 And the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." Thus the king swore to him.
10誌馬 19:24 Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came [home] in peace.
10誌馬 19:25 And it was when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
10誌馬 19:26 So he answered, "O my lord, the king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said, 'I will saddle a donkey for myself that I may ride on it and go with the king,' because your servant is lame.
10誌馬 19:27 "Moreover, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God, therefore do what is good in your sight.
10誌馬 19:28 "For all my father's household was nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right do I have yet that I should complain anymore to the king?"
10誌馬 19:29 So the king said to him, "Why do you still speak of your affairs? I have decided, 'You and Ziba shall divide the land.'"
10誌馬 19:30 And Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has come safely to his own house."
10誌馬 19:31 Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim; and he went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan.
10誌馬 19:32 Now Barzillai was very old, being eighty years old; and he had sustained the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.
10誌馬 19:33 And the king said to Barzillai, "You cross over with me and I will sustain you in Jerusalem with me."
10誌馬 19:34 But Barzillai said to the king, "How long have I yet to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
10誌馬 19:35 "I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
10誌馬 19:36 "Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me [with] this reward?
10誌馬 19:37 "Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. However, here is your servant Chimham, let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight."
10誌馬 19:38 And the king answered, "Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your sight; and whatever you require of me, I will do for you."
10誌馬 19:39 All the people crossed over the Jordan and the king crossed too. The king then kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place.
10誌馬 19:40 Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king.
10誌馬 19:41 And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, "Why had our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household and all David's men with him over the Jordan?"
10誌馬 19:42 Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's [expense], or has anything been taken for us?"
10誌馬 19:43 But the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, "We have ten parts in the king, therefore we also have more [claim] on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt? Was it not our advice first to bring back our king?" Yet the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel.
10誌馬 20:1 Now a worthless fellow happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet and said, "We have no portion in David, Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; Every man to his tents, O Israel!"
10誌馬 20:2 So all the men of Israel withdrew from following David, [and] followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah remained steadfast to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
10誌馬 20:3 Then David came to his house at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and placed them under guard and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as widows.
10誌馬 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call out the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself."
10誌馬 20:5 So Amasa went to call out [the men of] Judah, but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
10誌馬 20:6 And David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities and escape from our sight."
10誌馬 20:7 So Joab's men went out after him, along with the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:8 When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military attire, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist; and as he went forward, it fell out.
10誌馬 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
10誌馬 20:10 But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was in Joab's hand so he struck him in the belly with it and poured out his inward parts on the ground, and did not [strike] him again; and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:11 Now there stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, "Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, [let him] follow Joab."
10誌馬 20:12 But Amasa lay wallowing in [his] blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
10誌馬 20:13 As soon as he was removed from the highway, all the men passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
10誌馬 20:14 Now he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel even to Beth-maacah and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him.
10誌馬 20:15 And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple the wall.
10誌馬 20:16 Then a wise woman called from the city, "Hear, hear! Please tell Joab, 'Come here that I may speak with you.'"
10誌馬 20:17 So he approached her, and the woman said, "Are you Joab?" And he answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your maidservant." And he answered, "I am listening."
10誌馬 20:18 Then she spoke, saying, "Formerly they used to say, 'They will surely ask [advice] at Abel,' and thus they ended [the dispute.]
10誌馬 20:19 "I am of those who are peaceable [and] faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city, even a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?"
10誌馬 20:20 And Joab answered and said, "Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy!
10誌馬 20:21 "Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against King David. Only hand him over, and I will depart from the city." And the woman said to Joab, "Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall."
10誌馬 20:22 Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem.
10誌馬 20:23 Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
10誌馬 20:24 and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
10誌馬 20:25 and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
10誌馬 20:26 and Ira the Jairite was also a priest to David.
10誌馬 21:1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the LORD. And the LORD said, "It is for Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death."
10誌馬 21:2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the sons of Israel made a covenant with them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah).
10誌馬 21:3 Thus David said to the Gibeonites, "What should I do for you? And how can I make atonement that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
10誌馬 21:4 Then the Gibeonites said to him, "We have no [concern] of silver or gold with Saul or his house, nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel." And he said, "I will do for you whatever you say."
10誌馬 21:5 So they said to the king, "The man who consumed us, and who planned to exterminate us from remaining within any border of Israel,
10誌馬 21:6 let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD. "And the king said," I will give [them. "]
10誌馬 21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the LORD which was between them, between David and Saul's son Jonathan.
10誌馬 21:8 So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Armoni and Mephibosheth whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had born to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
10誌馬 21:9 Then he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the LORD, so that the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the beginning of barley harvest.
10誌馬 21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until it rained on them from the sky; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.
10誌馬 21:11 When it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
10誌馬 21:12 then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day the Philistines struck down Saul in Gilboa.
10誌馬 21:13 And he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged.
10誌馬 21:14 And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the grave of Kish his father; thus they did all that the king commanded, and after that God was moved by entreaty for the land.
10誌馬 21:15 Now when the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David went down and his servants with him; and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary.
10誌馬 21:16 Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred [shekels] of bronze in weight, was girded with a new [sword,] and he intended to kill David.
10誌馬 21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You shall not go out again with us to battle, that you may not extinguish the lamp of Israel."
10誌馬 21:18 Now it came about after this that there was war again with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was among the descendants of the giant.
10誌馬 21:19 And there was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
10誌馬 21:20 And there was war at Gath again, where there was a man of [great] stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also had been born to the giant.
10誌馬 21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
10誌馬 21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
10誌馬 22:1 And David spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
10誌馬 22:2 And he said, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;
10誌馬 22:3 My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, Thou dost save me from violence.
10誌馬 22:4 "I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; And I am saved from my enemies.
10誌馬 22:5 "For the waves of death encompassed me; The torrents of destruction overwhelmed me;
10誌馬 22:6 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
10誌馬 22:7 "In my distress I called upon the LORD, Yes, I cried to my God; And from His temple He heard my voice, And my cry for help [came] into His ears.
10誌馬 22:8 "Then the earth shook and quaked, The foundations of heaven were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry.
10誌馬 22:9 "Smoke went up out of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it.
10誌馬 22:10 "He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet.
10誌馬 22:11 "And He rode on a cherub and flew; And He appeared on the wings of the wind.
10誌馬 22:12 "And He made darkness canopies around Him, A mass of waters, thick clouds of the sky.
10誌馬 22:13 "From the brightness before Him Coals of fire were kindled.
10誌馬 22:14 "The LORD thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice.
10誌馬 22:15 "And He sent out arrows, and scattered them, Lightning, and routed them.
10誌馬 22:16 "Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of the LORD, At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
10誌馬 22:17 "He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
10誌馬 22:18 "He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
10誌馬 22:19 "They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my support.
10誌馬 22:20 "He also brought me forth into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
10誌馬 22:21 "The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
10誌馬 22:22 "For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not acted wickedly against my God.
10誌馬 22:23 "For all His ordinances [were] before me; And [as for] His statutes, I did not depart from them.
10誌馬 22:24 "I was also blameless toward Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.
10誌馬 22:25 "Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes.
10誌馬 22:26 "With the kind Thou dost show Thyself kind, With the blameless Thou dost show Thyself blameless;
10誌馬 22:27 With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure, And with the perverted Thou dost show Thyself astute.
10誌馬 22:28 "And Thou dost save an afflicted people; But Thine eyes are on the haughty [whom] Thou dost abase.
10誌馬 22:29 "For Thou art my lamp, O LORD; And the LORD illumines my darkness.
10誌馬 22:30 "For by Thee I can run upon a troop; By my God I can leap over a wall.
10誌馬 22:31 "As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tested; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
10誌馬 22:32 "For who is God, besides the LORD? And who is a rock, besides our God?
10誌馬 22:33 "God is my strong fortress; And He sets the blameless in His way.
10誌馬 22:34 "He makes my feet like hinds' [feet], And sets me on my high places.
10誌馬 22:35 "He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
10誌馬 22:36 "Thou hast also given me the shield of Thy salvation, And Thy help makes me great.
10誌馬 22:37 "Thou dost enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.
10誌馬 22:38 "I pursued my enemies and destroyed them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
10誌馬 22:39 "And I have devoured them and shattered them, so that they did not rise; And they fell under my feet.
10誌馬 22:40 "For Thou hast girded me with strength for battle; Thou hast subdued under me those who rose up against me.
10誌馬 22:41 "Thou hast also made my enemies turn [their] backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me.
10誌馬 22:42 "They looked, but there was none to save; [Even] to the LORD, but He did not answer them.
10誌馬 22:43 "Then I pulverized them as the dust of the earth, I crushed [and] stamped them as the mire of the streets.
10誌馬 22:44 "Thou hast also delivered me from the contentions of my people; Thou hast kept me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me.
10誌馬 22:45 "Foreigners pretend obedience to me; As soon as they hear, they obey me.
10誌馬 22:46 "Foreigners lose heart, And come trembling out of their fortresses.
10誌馬 22:47 "The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
10誌馬 22:48 The God who executes vengeance for me, And brings down peoples under me,
10誌馬 22:49 Who also brings me out from my enemies; Thou dost even lift me above those who rise up against me; Thou dost rescue me from the violent man.
10誌馬 22:50 "Therefore I will give thanks to Thee, O LORD, among the nations, And I will sing praises to Thy name.
10誌馬 22:51 "[He] is a tower of deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever."
10誌馬 23:1 Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse declares, And the man who was raised on high declares, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel,
10誌馬 23:2 "The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was on my tongue.
10誌馬 23:3 "The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, 'He who rules over men righteously, Who rules in the fear of God,
10誌馬 23:4 Is as the light of the morning [when] the sun rises, A morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs] out of the earth, Through sunshine after rain. '
10誌馬 23:5 "Truly is not my house so with God? For He has made an everlasting covenant with me, Ordered in all things, and secured; For all my salvation and all [my] desire, Will He not indeed make [it] grow?
10誌馬 23:6 "But the worthless, every one of them will be thrust away like thorns, Because they cannot be taken in hand;
10誌馬 23:7 But the man who touches them Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, And they will be completely burned with fire in [their] place. "
10誌馬 23:8 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, he was [called] Adino the Eznite, because of eight hundred slain [by him] at one time;
10誌馬 23:9 and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle and the men of Israel had withdrawn.
10誌馬 23:10 He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword, and the LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip [the slain].
10誌馬 23:11 Now after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people fled from the Philistines.
10誌馬 23:12 But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, defended it and struck the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory.
10誌馬 23:13 Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the troop of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim.
10誌馬 23:14 And David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
10誌馬 23:15 And David had a craving and said, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"
10誌馬 23:16 So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took [it] and brought [it] to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD;
10誌馬 23:17 and he said, "Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. [ Shall I drink] the blood of the men who went in [jeopardy] of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
10誌馬 23:18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he swung his spear against three hundred and killed [them,] and had a name as well as the three.
10誌馬 23:19 He was most honored of the thirty, therefore he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the three.
10誌馬 23:20 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.
10誌馬 23:21 And he killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Now the Egyptian [had] a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
10誌馬 23:22 These [things] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as the three mighty men.
10誌馬 23:23 He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his guard.
10誌馬 23:24 Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
10誌馬 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
10誌馬 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
10誌馬 23:27 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
10誌馬 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
10誌馬 23:29 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,
10誌馬 23:30 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
10誌馬 23:31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
10誌馬 23:32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
10誌馬 23:33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
10誌馬 23:34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
10誌馬 23:35 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
10誌馬 23:36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
10誌馬 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
10誌馬 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
10誌馬 23:39 Uriah the Hittite; thirty-seven in all.
10誌馬 24:1 Now again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, "Go, number Israel and Judah."
10誌馬 24:2 And the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, "Go about now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and register the people, that I may know the number of the people."
10誌馬 24:3 But Joab said to the king, "Now may the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king [still] see; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"
10誌馬 24:4 Nevertheless, the king's word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king, to register the people of Israel.
10誌馬 24:5 And they crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer.
10誌馬 24:6 Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon,
10誌馬 24:7 and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, [to] Beersheba.
10誌馬 24:8 So when they had gone about through the whole land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
10誌馬 24:9 And Joab gave the number of the registration of the people to the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
10誌馬 24:10 Now David's heart troubled him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have acted very foolishly."
10誌馬 24:11 When David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
10誌馬 24:12 "Go and speak to David, 'Thus the LORD says," I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I may do to you. "'"
10誌馬 24:13 So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, "Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me."
10誌馬 24:14 Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress. Let us now fall into the hand of the LORD for His mercies are great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man."
10誌馬 24:15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
10誌馬 24:16 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, "It is enough! Now relax your hand!" And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
10誌馬 24:17 Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was striking down the people, and said, "Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let Thy hand be against me and against my father's house."
10誌馬 24:18 So Gad came to David that day and said to him, "Go up, erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10誌馬 24:19 And David went up according to the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded.
10誌馬 24:20 And Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and Araunah went out and bowed his face to the ground before the king.
10誌馬 24:21 Then Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" And David said," To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be held back from the people. "
10誌馬 24:22 And Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what is good in his sight. Look, the oxen for the burnt offering, the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
10誌馬 24:23 "Everything, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you."
10誌馬 24:24 However, the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will surely buy [it] from you for a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
10誌馬 24:25 And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Thus the LORD was moved by entreaty for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel.
