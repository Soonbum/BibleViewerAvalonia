24方 1:1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
24方 1:2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
24方 1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
24方 1:4 Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
24方 1:5 "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."
24方 1:6 Then I said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, Because I am a youth."
24方 1:7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a youth,' Because everywhere I send you, you shall go, And all that I command you, you shall speak.
24方 1:8 "Do not be afraid of them, For I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD.
24方 1:9 Then the LORD stretched out His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.
24方 1:10 "See, I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, To pluck up and to break down, To destroy and to overthrow, To build and to plant."
24方 1:11 And the word of the LORD came to me saying, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "I see a rod of an almond tree."
24方 1:12 Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it."
24方 1:13 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."
24方 1:14 Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north the evil will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
24方 1:15 "For, behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north," declares the LORD; "and they will come, and they will set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
24方 1:16 "And I will pronounce My judgments on them concerning all their wickedness, whereby they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
24方 1:17 "Now, gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all which I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, lest I dismay you before them.
24方 1:18 "Now behold, I have made you today as a fortified city, and as a pillar of iron and as walls of bronze against the whole land, to the kings of Judah, to its princes, to its priests and to the people of the land.
24方 1:19 "And they will fight against you, but they will not overcome you, for I am with you to deliver you," declares the LORD.
24方 2:1 Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
24方 2:2 "Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, "I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth, The love of your betrothals, Your following after Me in the wilderness, Through a land not sown.
24方 2:3 "Israel was holy to the LORD, The first of His harvest; All who ate of it became guilty; Evil came upon them," declares the LORD. '"
24方 2:4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
24方 2:5 Thus says the LORD, "What injustice did your fathers find in Me, That they went far from Me And walked after emptiness and became empty?
24方 2:6 "And they did not say, 'Where is the LORD Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, Who led us through the wilderness, Through a land of deserts and of pits, Through a land of drought and of deep darkness, Through a land that no one crossed And where no man dwelt?'
24方 2:7 "And I brought you into the fruitful land, To eat its fruit and its good things. But you came and defiled My land, And My inheritance you made an abomination.
24方 2:8 "The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?' And those who handle the law did not know Me; The rulers also transgressed against Me, And the prophets prophesied by Baal And walked after things that did not profit.
24方 2:9 "Therefore I will yet contend with you," declares the LORD, "And with your sons' sons I will contend.
24方 2:10 "For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see, And send to Kedar and observe closely, And see if there has been such [a thing] as this!
24方 2:11 "Has a nation changed gods, When they were not gods? But My people have changed their glory For that which does not profit.
24方 2:12 "Be appalled, O heavens, at this, And shudder, be very desolate," declares the LORD.
24方 2:13 "For My people have committed two evils： They have forsaken Me, The fountain of living waters, To hew for themselves cisterns, Broken cisterns, That can hold no water.
24方 2:14 "Is Israel a slave? Or is he a homeborn servant? Why has he become a prey?
24方 2:15 "The young lions have roared at him, They have roared loudly. And they have made his land a waste; His cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant.
24方 2:16 "Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes Have shaved the crown of your head.
24方 2:17 "Have you not done this to yourself, By your forsaking the LORD your God, When He led you in the way?
24方 2:18 "But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt, To drink the waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing on the road to Assyria, To drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24方 2:19 "Your own wickedness will correct you, And your apostasies will reprove you; Know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter For you to forsake the LORD your God, And the dread of Me is not in you," declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
24方 2:20 "For long ago I broke your yoke [And] tore off your bonds; But you said, 'I will not serve!' For on every high hill And under every green tree You have lain down as a harlot.
24方 2:21 "Yet I planted you a choice vine, A completely faithful seed. How then have you turned yourself before Me Into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine?
24方 2:22 "Although you wash yourself with lye And use much soap, The stain of your iniquity is before Me," declares the Lord GOD.
24方 2:23 "How can you say, 'I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals'? Look at your way in the valley! Know what you have done! You are a swift young camel entangling her ways,
24方 2:24 A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness, That sniffs the wind in her passion. In [the time of] her heat who can turn her away? All who seek her will not become weary; In her month they will find her.
24方 2:25 "Keep your feet from being unshod And your throat from thirst; But you said, 'It is hopeless! No! For I have loved strangers, And after them I will walk.'
24方 2:26 "As the thief is shamed when he is discovered, So the house of Israel is shamed; They, their kings, their princes, And their priests, and their prophets,
24方 2:27 Who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' And to a stone, 'You gave me birth.' For they have turned [their] back to Me, And not [their] face; But in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise and save us.'
24方 2:28 "But where are your gods Which you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you In the time of your trouble; For [according to] the number of your cities Are your gods, O Judah.
24方 2:29 "Why do you contend with Me? You have all transgressed against Me," declares the LORD.
24方 2:30 "In vain I have struck your sons; They accepted no chastening. Your sword has devoured your prophets Like a destroying lion.
24方 2:31 "O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, Or a land of thick darkness? Why do My people say, 'We [are free to] roam; We will come no more to Thee'?
24方 2:32 "Can a virgin forget her ornaments, Or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me Days without number.
24方 2:33 "How well you prepare your way To seek love! Therefore even the wicked women You have taught your ways.
24方 2:34 "Also on your skirts is found The lifeblood of the innocent poor; You did not find them breaking in. But in spite of all these things,
24方 2:35 Yet you said, 'I am innocent; Surely His anger is turned away from me.' Behold, I will enter into judgment with you Because you say, 'I have not sinned.'
24方 2:36 "Why do you go around so much Changing your way? Also, you shall be put to shame by Egypt As you were put to shame by Assyria.
24方 2:37 "From this [place] also you shall go out With your hands on your head; For the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, And you shall not prosper with them."
24方 3:1 [God] says, "If a husband divorces his wife, And she goes from him, And belongs to another man, Will he still return to her? Will not that land be completely polluted? But you are a harlot [with] many lovers; Yet you turn to Me," declares the LORD.
24方 3:2 "Lift up your eyes to the bare heights and see; Where have you not been violated? By the roads you have sat for them Like an Arab in the desert, And you have polluted a land With your harlotry and with your wickedness.
24方 3:3 "Therefore the showers have been withheld, And there has been no spring rain. Yet you had a harlot's forehead; You refused to be ashamed.
24方 3:4 "Have you not just now called to Me, 'My Father, Thou art the friend of my youth?
24方 3:5 'Will He be angry forever? Will He be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken And have done evil things, And you have had your way. "
24方 3:6 Then the LORD said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what faithless Israel did? She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she was a harlot there.
24方 3:7 "And I thought, 'After she has done all these things, she will return to Me'; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
24方 3:8 "And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and was a harlot also.
24方 3:9 "And it came about because of the lightness of her harlotry, that she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
24方 3:10 "And yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception," declares the LORD.
24方 3:11 And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
24方 3:12 "Go, and proclaim these words toward the north and say, 'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD; 'I will not look upon you in anger. For I am gracious,' declares the LORD; 'I will not be angry forever.
24方 3:13 'Only acknowledge your iniquity, That you have transgressed against the LORD your God And have scattered your favors to the strangers under every green tree, And you have not obeyed My voice,' declares the LORD.
24方 3:14 'Return, O faithless sons,' declares the LORD; 'For I am a master to you, And I will take you one from a city and two from a family, And I will bring you to Zion.'
24方 3:15 "Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding.
24方 3:16 "And it shall be in those days when you are multiplied and increased in the land," declares the LORD, "they shall say no more, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' And it shall not come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they miss [it,] nor shall it be made again.
24方 3:17 "At that time they shall call Jerusalem 'The Throne of the LORD,' and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Jerusalem, for the name of the LORD; nor shall they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
24方 3:18 "In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.
24方 3:19 "Then I said, 'How I would set you among My sons, And give you a pleasant land, The most beautiful inheritance of the nations!' And I said, ' You shall call Me, My Father, And not turn away from following Me. '
24方 3:20 "Surely, as a woman treacherously departs from her lover, So you have dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel," declares the LORD.
24方 3:21 A voice is heard on the bare heights, The weeping [and] the supplications of the sons of Israel; Because they have perverted their way, They have forgotten the LORD their God.
24方 3:22 "Return, O faithless sons, I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to Thee; For Thou art the LORD our God.
24方 3:23 "Surely, the hills are a deception, A tumult [on] the mountains. Surely, in the LORD our God Is the salvation of Israel.
24方 3:24 "But the shameful thing has consumed the labor of our fathers since our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
24方 3:25 "Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, since our youth even to this day. And we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."
24方 4:1 "If you will return, O Israel," declares the LORD, "[Then] you should return to Me. And if you will put away your detested things from My presence, And will not waver,
24方 4:2 And you will swear, 'As the LORD lives,' In truth, in justice, and in righteousness; Then the nations will bless themselves in Him, And in Him they will glory. "
24方 4:3 For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, " Break up your fallow ground, And do not sow among thorns.
24方 4:4 "Circumcise yourselves to the LORD And remove the foreskins of your heart, Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Lest My wrath go forth like fire And burn with none to quench it, Because of the evil of your deeds."
24方 4:5 Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land; Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves, and let us go Into the fortified cities.'
24方 4:6 "Lift up a standard toward Zion! Seek refuge, do not stand [still,] For I am bringing evil from the north, And great destruction.
24方 4:7 "A lion has gone up from his thicket, And a destroyer of nations has set out; He has gone out from his place To make your land a waste. Your cities will be ruins Without inhabitant.
24方 4:8 "For this, put on sackcloth, Lament and wail; For the fierce anger of the LORD Has not turned back from us."
24方 4:9 "And it shall come about in that day," declares the LORD, "that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail; and the priests will be appalled, and the prophets will be astounded."
24方 4:10 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Surely Thou hast utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You will have peace'; whereas a sword touches the throat."
24方 4:11 In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness in the direction of the daughter of My people-- not to winnow, and not to cleanse,
24方 4:12 a wind too strong for this-- will come at My command; now I will also pronounce judgments against them.
24方 4:13 "Behold, he goes up like clouds, And his chariots like the whirlwind; His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!"
24方 4:14 Wash your heart from evil, O Jerusalem, That you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts Lodge within you?
24方 4:15 For a voice declares from Dan, And proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim.
24方 4:16 "Report [it] to the nations, now! Proclaim over Jerusalem, 'Besiegers come from a far country, And lift their voices against the cities of Judah.
24方 4:17 'Like watchmen of a field they are against her round about, Because she has rebelled against Me,' declares the LORD.
24方 4:18 "Your ways and your deeds Have brought these things to you. This is your evil. How bitter! How it has touched your heart!"
24方 4:19 My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war.
24方 4:20 Disaster on disaster is proclaimed, For the whole land is devastated; Suddenly my tents are devastated, My curtains in an instant.
24方 4:21 How long must I see the standard, And hear the sound of the trumpet?
24方 4:22 "For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are stupid children, And they have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to do good they do not know."
24方 4:23 I looked on the earth, and behold, [it was] formless and void; And to the heavens, and they had no light.
24方 4:24 I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro.
24方 4:25 I looked, and behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled.
24方 4:26 I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled down Before the LORD, before His fierce anger.
24方 4:27 For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation, Yet I will not execute a complete destruction.
24方 4:28 "For this the earth shall mourn, And the heavens above be dark, Because I have spoken, I have purposed, And I will not change My mind, nor will I turn from it."
24方 4:29 At the sound of the horseman and bowman every city flees; They go into the thickets and climb among the rocks; Every city is forsaken, And no man dwells in them.
24方 4:30 And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Although you dress in scarlet, Although you decorate [yourself with] ornaments of gold, Although you enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you make yourself beautiful; [Your] lovers despise you; They seek your life.
24方 4:31 For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, Stretching out her hands, [saying,] "Ah, woe is me, for I faint before murderers."
24方 5:1 "Roam to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, And look now, and take note. And seek in her open squares, If you can find a man, If there is one who does justice, who seeks truth, Then I will pardon her.
24方 5:2 "And although they say, 'As the LORD lives,' Surely they swear falsely."
24方 5:3 O LORD, do not Thine eyes look for truth? Thou hast smitten them, [ But] they did not weaken; Thou hast consumed them, But they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; They have refused to repent.
24方 5:4 Then I said, "They are only the poor, They are foolish; For they do not know the way of the LORD [Or] the ordinance of their God.
24方 5:5 "I will go to the great And will speak to them, For they know the way of the LORD, [And] the ordinance of their God." But they too, with one accord, have broken the yoke [And] burst the bonds.
24方 5:6 Therefore a lion from the forest shall slay them, A wolf of the deserts shall destroy them, A leopard is watching their cities. Everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, Because their transgressions are many, Their apostasies are numerous.
24方 5:7 "Why should I pardon you? Your sons have forsaken Me And sworn by those who are not gods. When I had fed them to the full, They committed adultery And trooped to the harlot's house.
24方 5:8 "They were well-fed lusty horses, Each one neighing after his neighbor's wife.
24方 5:9 "Shall I not punish these [people,]" declares the LORD, "And on a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?
24方 5:10 "Go up through her vine rows and destroy, But do not execute a complete destruction; Strip away her branches, For they are not the Lord's.
24方 5:11 "For the house of Israel and the house of Judah Have dealt very treacherously with Me," declares the LORD.
24方 5:12 They have lied about the LORD And said, "Not He; Misfortune will not come on us; And we will not see sword or famine.
24方 5:13 "And the prophets are [as] wind, And the word is not in them. Thus it will be done to them!"
24方 5:14 Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, "Because you have spoken this word, Behold, I am making My words in your mouth fire And this people wood, and it will consume them.
24方 5:15 "Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel," declares the LORD. "It is an enduring nation, It is an ancient nation, A nation whose language you do not know, Nor can you understand what they say.
24方 5:16 "Their quiver is like an open grave, All of them are mighty men.
24方 5:17 "And they will devour your harvest and your food; They will devour your sons and your daughters; They will devour your flocks and your herds; They will devour your vines and your fig trees; They will demolish with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
24方 5:18 "Yet even in those days," declares the LORD, "I will not make you a complete destruction.
24方 5:19 "And it shall come about when they say, 'Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?' then you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'
24方 5:20 "Declare this in the house of Jacob And proclaim it in Judah, saying,
24方 5:21 'Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, Who have eyes, but see not; Who have ears, but hear not.
24方 5:22 'Do you not fear Me?' declares the LORD. 'Do you not tremble in My presence? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, An eternal decree, so it cannot cross over it. Though the waves toss, yet they cannot prevail; Though they roar, yet they cannot cross over it.
24方 5:23 'But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; They have turned aside and departed.
24方 5:24 'They do not say in their heart, "Let us now fear the LORD our God, Who gives rain in its season, Both the autumn rain and the spring rain, Who keeps for us The appointed weeks of the harvest."
24方 5:25 'Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have withheld good from you.
24方 5:26 'For wicked men are found among My people, They watch like fowlers lying in wait; They set a trap, They catch men.
24方 5:27 'Like a cage full of birds, So their houses are full of deceit; Therefore they have become great and rich.
24方 5:28 'They are fat, they are sleek, They also excel in deeds of wickedness; They do not plead the cause, The cause of the orphan, that they may prosper; And they do not defend the rights of the poor.
24方 5:29 'Shall I not punish these [people?'] declares the LORD, 'On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?'
24方 5:30 "An appalling and horrible thing Has happened in the land：
24方 5:31 The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule on their [own] authority; And My people love it so! But what will you do at the end of it?
24方 6:1 "Flee for safety, O sons of Benjamin, From the midst of Jerusalem! Now blow a trumpet in Tekoa, And raise a signal over Beth-haccerem; For evil looks down from the north, And a great destruction.
24方 6:2 "The comely and dainty one, the daughter of Zion, I will cut off.
24方 6:3 "Shepherds and their flocks will come to her, They will pitch [their] tents around her, They will pasture each in his place.
24方 6:4 "Prepare war against her; Arise, and let us attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day declines, For the shadows of the evening lengthen!
24方 6:5 "Arise, and let us attack by night And destroy her palaces!"
24方 6:6 For thus says the LORD of hosts, "Cut down her trees, And cast up a siege against Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished, In whose midst there is only oppression.
24方 6:7 "As a well keeps its waters fresh, So she keeps fresh her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard in her; Sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
24方 6:8 "Be warned, O Jerusalem, Lest I be alienated from you; Lest I make you a desolation, A land not inhabited."
24方 6:9 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "They will thoroughly glean as the vine the remnant of Israel; Pass your hand again like a grape gatherer Over the branches."
24方 6:10 To whom shall I speak and give warning, That they may hear? Behold, their ears are closed, And they cannot listen. Behold, the word of the LORD has become a reproach to them; They have no delight in it.
24方 6:11 But I am full of the wrath of the LORD： I am weary with holding [ it] in. "Pour [it] out on the children in the street, And on the gathering of young men together; For both husband and wife shall be taken, The aged and the very old.
24方 6:12 "And their houses shall be turned over to others, Their fields and their wives together; For I will stretch out My hand Against the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD.
24方 6:13 "For from the least of them even to the greatest of them, Everyone is greedy for gain, And from the prophet even to the priest Everyone deals falsely.
24方 6:14 "And they have healed the brokenness of My people superficially, Saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace.
24方 6:15 "Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done? They were not even ashamed at all; They did not even know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time that I punish them, They shall be cast down," says the LORD.
24方 6:16 Thus says the LORD, "Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; And you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, 'We will not walk [in it].'
24方 6:17 "And I set watchmen over you, [saying,] 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, 'We will not listen.'
24方 6:18 "Therefore hear, O nations, And know, O congregation, what is among them.
24方 6:19 "Hear, O earth： behold, I am bringing disaster on this people, The fruit of their plans, Because they have not listened to My words, And as for My law, they have rejected it also.
24方 6:20 "For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba, And the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, And your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me."
24方 6:21 Therefore, thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am laying stumbling blocks before this people. And they will stumble against them, Fathers and sons together; Neighbor and friend will perish."
24方 6:22 Thus says the LORD, "Behold, a people is coming from the north land, And a great nation will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth.
24方 6:23 "They seize bow and spear; They are cruel and have no mercy; Their voice roars like the sea, And they ride on horses, Arrayed as a man for the battle Against you, O daughter of Zion!"
24方 6:24 We have heard the report of it; Our hands are limp. Anguish has seized us, Pain as of a woman in childbirth.
24方 6:25 Do not go out into the field, And do not walk on the road, For the enemy has a sword, Terror is on every side.
24方 6:26 O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth And roll in ashes; Mourn as for an only son, A lamentation most bitter. For suddenly the destroyer Will come upon us.
24方 6:27 "I have made you an assayer [and] a tester among My people, That you may know and assay their way."
24方 6:28 All of them are stubbornly rebellious, Going about as a talebearer. [ They are] bronze and iron; They, all of them, are corrupt.
24方 6:29 The bellows blow fiercely, The lead is consumed by the fire; In vain the refining goes on, But the wicked are not separated.
24方 6:30 They call them rejected silver, Because the LORD has rejected them.
24方 7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24方 7:2 "Stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim there this word, and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, who enter by these gates to worship the LORD!'"
24方 7:3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.
24方 7:4 "Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'
24方 7:5 "For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor,
24方 7:6 [if] you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your own ruin,
24方 7:7 then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
24方 7:8 "Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
24方 7:9 "Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and offer sacrifices to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,
24方 7:10 then come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, 'We are delivered!'-- that you may do all these abominations?
24方 7:11 "Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I, even I, have seen [it,"] declares the LORD.
24方 7:12 "But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
24方 7:13 "And now, because you have done all these things," declares the LORD, "and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you but you did not answer,
24方 7:14 therefore, I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
24方 7:15 "And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, all the offspring of Ephraim.
24方 7:16 "As for you, do not pray for this people, and do not lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with Me; for I do not hear you.
24方 7:17 "Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24方 7:18 "The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and [they] pour out libations to other gods in order to spite Me.
24方 7:19 "Do they spite Me?" declares the LORD. "Is it not themselves [they spite,] to their own shame?"
24方 7:20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and on beast and on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched."
24方 7:21 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh.
24方 7:22 "For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
24方 7:23 "But this is what I commanded them, saying, 'Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.'
24方 7:24 "Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in [their own] counsels [and] in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.
24方 7:25 "Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending [them.]
24方 7:26 "Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did evil more than their fathers.
24方 7:27 "And you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
24方 7:28 "And you shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction; truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth.
24方 7:29 'Cut off your hair and cast [it] away, And take up a lamentation on the bare heights; For the LORD has rejected and forsaken The generation of His wrath.'
24方 7:30 "For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight," declares the LORD, "they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
24方 7:31 "And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind.
24方 7:32 "Therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no [other] place.
24方 7:33 "And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten [them away.]
24方 7:34 "Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.
24方 8:1 "At that time," declares the LORD, "they will bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem from their graves.
24方 8:2 "And they will spread them out to the sun, the moon, and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or buried; they will be as dung on the face of the ground.
24方 8:3 "And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them," declares the LORD of hosts.
24方 8:4 "And you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Do [men] fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not repent?
24方 8:5 "Why then has this people, Jerusalem, Turned away in continual apostasy? They hold fast to deceit, They refuse to return.
24方 8:6 "I have listened and heard, They have spoken what is not right; No man repented of his wickedness, Saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turned to his course, Like a horse charging into the battle.
24方 8:7 "Even the stork in the sky Knows her seasons; And the turtledove and the swift and the thrush Observe the time of their migration; But My people do not know The ordinance of the LORD.
24方 8:8 "How can you say, 'We are wise, And the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes Has made [it] into a lie.
24方 8:9 "The wise men are put to shame, They are dismayed and caught; Behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, And what kind of wisdom do they have?
24方 8:10 "Therefore I will give their wives to others, Their fields to new owners; Because from the least even to the greatest Everyone is greedy for gain; From the prophet even to the priest Everyone practices deceit.
24方 8:11 "And they heal the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially, Saying, 'Peace, peace,' But there is no peace.
24方 8:12 "Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done? They certainly were not ashamed, And they did not know how to blush; Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the time of their punishment they shall be brought down," Declares the LORD.
24方 8:13 "I will surely snatch them away," declares the LORD; "There will be no grapes on the vine, And no figs on the fig tree, And the leaf shall wither; And what I have given them shall pass away." '"
24方 8:14 Why are we sitting still? Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities, And let us perish there, Because the LORD our God has doomed us And given us poisoned water to drink, For we have sinned against the LORD.
24方 8:15 [We] waited for peace, but no good [came;] For a time of healing, but behold, terror!
24方 8:16 From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the neighing of his stallions The whole land quakes; For they come and devour the land and its fulness, The city and its inhabitants.
24方 8:17 "For behold, I am sending serpents against you, Adders, for which there is no charm, And they will bite you," declares the LORD.
24方 8:18 My sorrow is beyond healing, My heart is faint [within me!]
24方 8:19 Behold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land： "Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her?" "Why have they provoked Me with their graven images, with foreign idols?"
24方 8:20 "Harvest is past, summer is ended, And we are not saved."
24方 8:21 For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am broken; I mourn, dismay has taken hold of me.
24方 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored?
24方 9:1 Oh, that my head were waters, And my eyes a fountain of tears, That I might weep day and night For the slain of the daughter of my people!
24方 9:2 O that I had in the desert A wayfarers' lodging place; That I might leave my people, And go from them! For all of them are adulterers, An assembly of treacherous men.
24方 9:3 "And they bend their tongue [like] their bow; Lies and not truth prevail in the land; For they proceed from evil to evil, And they do not know Me," declares the LORD.
24方 9:4 "Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor, And do not trust any brother; Because every brother deals craftily, And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer.
24方 9:5 "And everyone deceives his neighbor, And does not speak the truth, They have taught their tongue to speak lies; They weary themselves committing iniquity.
24方 9:6 "Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse to know Me," declares the LORD.
24方 9:7 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I will refine them and assay them; For what [else] can I do, because of the daughter of My people?
24方 9:8 "Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But inwardly he sets an ambush for him.
24方 9:9 "Shall I not punish them for these things?" declares the LORD. "On a nation such as this Shall I not avenge Myself?
24方 9:10 "For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing, And for the pastures of the wilderness a dirge, Because they are laid waste, so that no one passes through, And the lowing of the cattle is not heard; Both the birds of the sky and the beasts have fled; they are gone.
24方 9:11 "And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, A haunt of jackals; And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."
24方 9:12 Who is the wise man that may understand this? And [who is] he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a desert, so that no one passes through?
24方 9:13 And the LORD said, "Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it,
24方 9:14 but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them, "
24方 9:15 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.
24方 9:16 "And I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them."
24方 9:17 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come; And send for the wailing women, that they may come!
24方 9:18 "And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, That our eyes may shed tears, And our eyelids flow with water.
24方 9:19 "For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion, 'How are we ruined! We are put to great shame, For we have left the land, Because they have cast down our dwellings.'"
24方 9:20 Now hear the word of the LORD, O you women, And let your ear receive the word of His mouth; Teach your daughters wailing, And everyone her neighbor a dirge.
24方 9:21 For death has come up through our windows; It has entered our palaces To cut off the children from the streets, The young men from the town squares.
24方 9:22 Speak, "Thus declares the LORD, 'The corpses of men will fall like dung on the open field, And like the sheaf after the reaper, But no one will gather [them.]'"
24方 9:23 Thus says the LORD, "Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches;
24方 9:24 but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things, "declares the LORD.
24方 9:25 "Behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised--
24方 9:26 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart. "
24方 10:1 Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
24方 10:2 Thus says the LORD, "Do not learn the way of the nations, And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens Although the nations are terrified by them;
24方 10:3 For the customs of the peoples are delusion; Because it is wood cut from the forest, The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.
24方 10:4 "They decorate [it] with silver and with gold; They fasten it with nails and with hammers So that it will not totter.
24方 10:5 "Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot walk! Do not fear them, For they can do no harm, Nor can they do any good."
24方 10:6 There is none like Thee, O LORD; Thou art great, and great is Thy name in might.
24方 10:7 Who would not fear Thee, O King of the nations? Indeed it is Thy due! For among all the wise men of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, There is none like Thee.
24方 10:8 But they are altogether stupid and foolish [In their] discipline of delusion-- their idol is wood!
24方 10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith; Violet and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skilled men.
24方 10:10 But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, And the nations cannot endure His indignation.
24方 10:11 Thus you shall say to them, "The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
24方 10:12 [It is] He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom; And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.
24方 10:13 When He utters His voice, [there is] a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings out the wind from His storehouses.
24方 10:14 Every man is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols; For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them.
24方 10:15 They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish.
24方 10:16 The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; The LORD of hosts is His name.
24方 10:17 Pick up your bundle from the ground, You who dwell under siege!
24方 10:18 For thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land At this time, And will cause them distress, That they may be found."
24方 10:19 Woe is me, because of my injury! My wound is incurable. But I said, "Truly this is a sickness, And I must bear it."
24方 10:20 My tent is destroyed, And all my ropes are broken; My sons have gone from me and are no more. There is no one to stretch out my tent again Or to set up my curtains.
24方 10:21 For the shepherds have become stupid And have not sought the LORD; Therefore they have not prospered, And all their flock is scattered.
24方 10:22 The sound of a report! Behold, it comes-- A great commotion out of the land of the north-- To make the cities of Judah A desolation, a haunt of jackals.
24方 10:23 I know, O LORD, that a man's way is not in himself; Nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps.
24方 10:24 Correct me, O LORD, but with justice; Not with Thine anger, lest Thou bring me to nothing.
24方 10:25 Pour out Thy wrath on the nations that do not know Thee, And on the families that do not call Thy name; For they have devoured Jacob; They have devoured him and consumed him, And have laid waste his habitation.
24方 11:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24方 11:2 "Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
24方 11:3 and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Cursed is the man who does not heed the words of this covenant
24方 11:4 which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, 'Listen to My voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,'
24方 11:5 in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is] this day. "'"Then I answered and said, "Amen, O LORD."
24方 11:6 And the LORD said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
24方 11:7 'For I solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, " Listen to My voice. "
24方 11:8 'Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded [them] to do, but they did not.' "
24方 11:9 Then the LORD said to me, "A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24方 11:10 "They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers."
24方 11:11 Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them.
24方 11:12 "Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they surely will not save them in the time of their disaster.
24方 11:13 "For your gods are as many as your cities, O Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.
24方 11:14 "Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.
24方 11:15 "What right has My beloved in My house When she has done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster, So [ that] you can rejoice?"
24方 11:16 The LORD called your name, "A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form"; With the noise of a great tumult He has kindled fire on it, And its branches are worthless.
24方 11:17 And the LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me by offering up sacrifices to Baal.
24方 11:18 Moreover, the LORD made it known to me and I knew it; Then Thou didst show me their deeds.
24方 11:19 But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, [saying,] "Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, And let us cut him off from the land of the living, That his name be remembered no more."
24方 11:20 But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tries the feelings and the heart, Let me see Thy vengeance on them, For to Thee have I committed my cause.
24方 11:21 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, that you might not die at our hand";
24方 11:22 therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will die by famine;
24方 11:23 and a remnant will not be left to them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth-- the year of their punishment. "
24方 12:1 Righteous art Thou, O LORD, that I would plead [my] case with Thee; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with Thee： Why has the way of the wicked prospered? [Why] are all those who deal in treachery at ease?
24方 12:2 Thou hast planted them, they have also taken root; They grow, they have even produced fruit. Thou art near to their lips But far from their mind.
24方 12:3 But Thou knowest me, O LORD; Thou seest me; And Thou dost examine my heart's [attitude] toward Thee. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a day of carnage!
24方 12:4 How long is the land to mourn And the vegetation of the countryside to wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, Animals and birds have been snatched away, Because [men] have said, "He will not see our latter ending."
24方 12:5 "If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out, Then how can you compete with horses? If you fall down in a land of peace, How will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?
24方 12:6 "For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you."
24方 12:7 "I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.
24方 12:8 "My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her.
24方 12:9 "Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me? Are the birds of prey against her on every side? Go, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!
24方 12:10 "Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard, They have trampled down My field; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness.
24方 12:11 "It has been made a desolation, Desolate, it mourns before Me; The whole land has been made desolate, Because no man lays it to heart.
24方 12:12 "On all the bare heights in the wilderness Destroyers have come, For a sword of the LORD is devouring From one end of the land even to the other; There is no peace for anyone.
24方 12:13 "They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, They have strained themselves to no profit. But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of the LORD."
24方 12:14 Thus says the LORD concerning all My wicked neighbors who strike at the inheritance with which I have endowed My people Israel, "Behold I am about to uproot them from their land and will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
24方 12:15 "And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.
24方 12:16 "Then it will come about that if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the midst of My people.
24方 12:17 "But if they will not listen, then I will uproot that nation, uproot and destroy it," declares the LORD.
24方 13:1 Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and buy yourself a linen waistband, and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water."
24方 13:2 So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the LORD and put it around my waist.
24方 13:3 Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying,
24方 13:4 "Take the waistband that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock."
24方 13:5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me.
24方 13:6 And it came about after many days that the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there."
24方 13:7 Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and lo, the waistband was ruined, it was totally worthless.
24方 13:8 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24方 13:9 "Thus says the LORD, 'Just so will I destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
24方 13:10 'This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have gone after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this waistband, which is totally worthless.
24方 13:11 'For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole household of Israel and the whole household of Judah cling to Me,' declares the LORD, 'that they might be for Me a people, for renown, for praise, and for glory; but they did not listen.'
24方 13:12 "Therefore you are to speak this word to them, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel," Every jug is to be filled with wine. "'And when they say to you, 'Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?'
24方 13:13 then say to them, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land-- the kings that sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem-- with drunkenness!
24方 13:14 "And I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons together," declares the LORD. "I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have compassion that I should not destroy them." '"
24方 13:15 Listen and give heed, do not be haughty, For the LORD has spoken.
24方 13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God, Before He brings darkness And before your feet stumble On the dusky mountains, And while you are hoping for light He makes it into deep darkness, [And] turns [it] into gloom.
24方 13:17 But if you will not listen to it, My soul will sob in secret for [ such] pride; And my eyes will bitterly weep And flow down with tears, Because the flock of the LORD has been taken captive.
24方 13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother, "Take a lowly seat, For your beautiful crown Has come down from your head."
24方 13:19 The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no one to open [them]; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into exile.
24方 13:20 "Lift up your eyes and see Those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, Your beautiful sheep?
24方 13:21 "What will you say when He appoints over you-- And you yourself had taught them-- Former companions to be head over you? Will not pangs take hold of you, Like a woman in childbirth?
24方 13:22 "And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things happened to me?' Because of the magnitude of your iniquity Your skirts have been removed, And your heels have been exposed.
24方 13:23 "Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? [Then] you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil.
24方 13:24 "Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw To the desert wind.
24方 13:25 "This is your lot, the portion measured to you From Me," declares the LORD, "Because you have forgotten Me And trusted in falsehood.
24方 13:26 "So I Myself have also stripped your skirts off over your face, That your shame may be seen.
24方 13:27 "As for your adulteries and your [lustful] neighings, The lewdness of your prostitution On the hills in the field, I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?"
24方 14:1 That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah in regard to the drought：
24方 14:2 "Judah mourns, And her gates languish; They sit on the ground in mourning, And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended.
24方 14:3 "And their nobles have sent their servants for water; They have come to the cisterns and found no water. They have returned with their vessels empty; They have been put to shame and humiliated, And they cover their heads.
24方 14:4 "Because the ground is cracked, For there has been no rain on the land; The farmers have been put to shame, They have covered their heads.
24方 14:5 "For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon [her young,] Because there is no grass.
24方 14:6 "And the wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; They pant for air like jackals, Their eyes fail For there is no vegetation.
24方 14:7 "Although our iniquities testify against us, O LORD, act for Thy name's sake! Truly our apostasies have been many, We have sinned against Thee.
24方 14:8 "Thou Hope of Israel, Its Savior in time of distress, Why art Thou like a stranger in the land Or like a traveler who has pitched his [tent] for the night?
24方 14:9 "Why art Thou like a man dismayed, Like a mighty man who cannot save? Yet Thou art in our midst, O LORD, And we are called by Thy name; Do not forsake us!"
24方 14:10 Thus says the LORD to this people, "Even so they have loved to wander; they have not kept their feet in check. Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their iniquity and call their sins to account."
24方 14:11 So the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
24方 14:12 "When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather I am going to make an end of them by the sword, famine and pestilence."
24方 14:13 But, "Ah, Lord GOD!" I said, "Look, the prophets are telling them, 'You will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.'"
24方 14:14 Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own minds.
24方 14:15 "Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them-- yet they keep saying, 'There shall be no sword or famine in this land'-- by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end!
24方 14:16 "The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them-- [neither] them, [nor] their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters-- for I shall pour out their [own] wickedness on them.
24方 14:17 "And you will say this word to them, 'Let my eyes flow down with tears night and day, And let them not cease; For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow, With a sorely infected wound.
24方 14:18 'If I go out to the country, Behold, those slain with the sword! Or if I enter the city, Behold, diseases of famine! For both prophet and priest Have gone roving about in the land that they do not know.' "
24方 14:19 Hast Thou completely rejected Judah? Or hast Thou loathed Zion? Why hast Thou stricken us so that we are beyond healing? [We] waited for peace, but nothing good [came;] And for a time of healing, but behold, terror!
24方 14:20 We know our wickedness, O LORD, The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against Thee.
24方 14:21 Do not despise [us,] for Thine own name's sake; Do not disgrace the throne of Thy glory; Remember [and] do not annul Thy covenant with us.
24方 14:22 Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain? Or can the heavens grant showers? Is it not Thou, O LORD our God? Therefore we hope in Thee, For Thou art the one who hast done all these things.
24方 15:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My heart would not be with this people; send them away from My presence and let them go!
24方 15:2 "And it shall be that when they say to you, 'Where should we go?' then you are to tell them, 'Thus says the LORD： "Those [destined] for death, to death; And those [destined] for the sword, to the sword; And those [destined] for famine, to famine; And those [destined] for captivity, to captivity. "'
24方 15:3 "And I shall appoint over them four kinds [of doom,]" declares the LORD :"the sword to slay, the dogs to drag off, and the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
24方 15:4 "And I shall make them an object of horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
24方 15:5 "Indeed, who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, Or who will mourn for you, Or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
24方 15:6 "You who have forsaken Me," declares the LORD, "You keep going backward. So I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you; I am tired of relenting!
24方 15:7 "And I will winnow them with a winnowing fork At the gates of the land; I will bereave [them] of children, I will destroy My people; They did not repent of their ways.
24方 15:8 "Their widows will be more numerous before Me Than the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of a young man, A destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down on her Anguish and dismay.
24方 15:9 "She who bore seven [sons] pines away; Her breathing is labored. Her sun has set while it was yet day; She has been shamed and humiliated. So I shall give over their survivors to the sword Before their enemies," declares the LORD.
24方 15:10 Woe to me, my mother, that you have borne me As a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land! I have neither lent, nor have men lent money to me, [Yet] everyone curses me.
24方 15:11 The LORD said, "Surely I will set you free for [purposes of] good; Surely I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you In a time of disaster and a time of distress.
24方 15:12 "Can anyone smash iron, Iron from the north, or bronze?
24方 15:13 "Your wealth and your treasures I will give for booty without cost, Even for all your sins And within all your borders.
24方 15:14 "Then I will cause your enemies to bring [it] Into a land you do not know; For a fire has been kindled in My anger, It will burn upon you."
24方 15:15 Thou who knowest, O LORD, Remember me, take notice of me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors. Do [not,] in view of Thy patience, take me away; Know that for Thy sake I endure reproach.
24方 15:16 Thy words were found and I ate them, And Thy words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Thy name, O LORD God of hosts.
24方 15:17 I did not sit in the circle of merrymakers, Nor did I exult. Because of Thy hand [upon me] I sat alone, For Thou didst fill me with indignation.
24方 15:18 Why has my pain been perpetual And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Wilt Thou indeed be to me like a deceptive [stream] With water that is unreliable?
24方 15:19 Therefore, thus says the LORD, "If you return, then I will restore you-- Before Me you will stand; And if you extract the precious from the worthless, You will become My spokesman. They for their part may turn to you, But as for you, you must not turn to them.
24方 15:20 "Then I will make you to this people A fortified wall of bronze; And though they fight against you, They will not prevail over you; For I am with you to save you And deliver you," declares the LORD.
24方 15:21 "So I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent."
24方 16:1 The word of the LORD also came to me saying,
24方 16:2 "You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place."
24方 16:3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bear them, and their fathers who beget them in this land：
24方 16:4 "They will die of deadly diseases, they will not be lamented or buried; they will be as dung on the surface of the ground and come to an end by sword and famine, and their carcasses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth."
24方 16:5 For thus says the LORD, "Do not enter a house of mourning, or go to lament or to console them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people," declares the LORD, "[My] lovingkindness and compassion.
24方 16:6 "Both great men and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, they will not be lamented, nor will anyone gash himself or shave his head for them.
24方 16:7 "Neither will men break [bread] in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone's father or mother.
24方 16:8 "Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink."
24方 16:9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel： "Behold, I am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your time, the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride.
24方 16:10 "Now it will come about when you tell this people all these words that they will say to you, 'For what reason has the LORD declared all this great calamity against us? And what is our iniquity, or what is our sin which we have committed against the LORD our God?'
24方 16:11 "Then you are to say to them, '[It is] because your forefathers have forsaken Me,' declares the LORD, 'and have followed other gods and served them and bowed down to them; but Me they have forsaken and have not kept My law.
24方 16:12 'You too have done evil, [even] more than your forefathers; for behold, you are each one walking according to the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without listening to Me.
24方 16:13 'So I will hurl you out of this land into the land which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I shall grant you no favor.'
24方 16:14 "Therefore behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be said, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
24方 16:15 but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries where He had banished them.' For I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers.
24方 16:16 "Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen," declares the LORD, "and they will fish for them; and afterwards I shall send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and from the clefts of the rocks.
24方 16:17 "For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.
24方 16:18 "And I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and with their abominations."
24方 16:19 O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, And my refuge in the day of distress, To Thee the nations will come From the ends of the earth and say, "Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood, Futility and things of no profit."
24方 16:20 Can man make gods for himself? Yet they are not gods!
24方 16:21 "Therefore behold, I am going to make them know-- This time I will make them know My power and My might; And they shall know that My name is the LORD."
24方 17:1 The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus; With a diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart, And on the horns of their altars,
24方 17:2 As they remember their children, So they [remember] their altars and their Asherim By green trees on the high hills.
24方 17:3 O mountain of Mine in the countryside, I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty, Your high places for sin throughout your borders.
24方 17:4 And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance That I gave you; And I will make you serve your enemies In the land which you do not know; For you have kindled a fire in My anger Which will burn forever.
24方 17:5 Thus says the LORD, "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the LORD.
24方 17:6 "For he will be like a bush in the desert And will not see when prosperity comes, But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, A land of salt without inhabitant.
24方 17:7 "Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD And whose trust is the LORD.
24方 17:8 "For he will be like a tree planted by the water, That extends its roots by a stream And will not fear when the heat comes; But its leaves will be green, And it will not be anxious in a year of drought Nor cease to yield fruit.
24方 17:9 "The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it?
24方 17:10 "I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds.
24方 17:11 "As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not laid, [So] is he who makes a fortune, but unjustly; In the midst of his days it will forsake him, And in the end he will be a fool."
24方 17:12 A glorious throne on high from the beginning Is the place of our sanctuary.
24方 17:13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, All who forsake Thee will be put to shame. Those who turn away on earth will be written down, Because they have forsaken the fountain of living water, even the LORD.
24方 17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; Save me and I will be saved, For Thou art my praise.
24方 17:15 Look, they keep saying to me, "Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now!"
24方 17:16 But as for me, I have not hurried away from [being] a shepherd after Thee, Nor have I longed for the woeful day; Thou Thyself knowest the utterance of my lips Was in Thy presence.
24方 17:17 Do not be a terror to me; Thou art my refuge in the day of disaster.
24方 17:18 Let those who persecute me be put to shame, but as for me, let me not be put to shame; Let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed. Bring on them a day of disaster, And crush them with twofold destruction!
24方 17:19 Thus the LORD said to me, "Go and stand in the public gate, through which the kings of Judah come in and go out, as well as in all the gates of Jerusalem;
24方 17:20 and say to them, 'Listen to the word of the LORD, kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem, who come in through these gates：
24方 17:21 'Thus says the LORD, "Take heed for yourselves, and do not carry any load on the sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem.
24方 17:22 "And you shall not bring a load out of your houses on the sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the sabbath day holy, as I commanded your forefathers.
24方 17:23 "Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks in order not to listen or take correction.
24方 17:24 "But it will come about, if you listen attentively to Me," declares the LORD, "to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to keep the sabbath day holy by doing no work on it,
24方 17:25 then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will be inhabited forever.
24方 17:26 "They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the LORD.
24方 17:27 "But if you do not listen to Me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I shall kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched." '"
24方 18:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,
24方 18:2 "Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I shall announce My words to you."
24方 18:3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and there he was, making something on the wheel.
24方 18:4 But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.
24方 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
24方 18:6 "Can I not, O house of Israel, deal with you as this potter [does]?" declares the LORD." Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
24方 18:7 "At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot, to pull down, or to destroy [it;]
24方 18:8 if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the calamity I planned to bring on it.
24方 18:9 "Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant [it;]
24方 18:10 if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will think better of the good with which I had promised to bless it.
24方 18:11 "So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, 'Thus says the LORD," Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds. "'
24方 18:12 "But they will say, 'It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.'
24方 18:13 "Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Ask now among the nations, Who ever heard the like of this? The virgin of Israel Has done a most appalling thing.
24方 18:14 'Does the snow of Lebanon forsake the rock of the open country? Or is the cold flowing water [from] a foreign [land] ever snatched away?
24方 18:15 'For My people have forgotten Me, They burn incense to worthless gods And they have stumbled from their ways, From the ancient paths, To walk in bypaths, Not on a highway,
24方 18:16 To make their land a desolation, [An object of] perpetual hissing; Everyone who passes by it will be astonished And shake his head.
24方 18:17 'Like an east wind I will scatter them Before the enemy; I will show them My back and not [My] face In the day of their calamity.' "
24方 18:18 Then they said, "Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Surely the law is not going to be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the sage, nor the [divine] word to the prophet! Come on and let us strike at him with [our] tongue, and let us give no heed to any of his words."
24方 18:19 Do give heed to me, O LORD, And listen to what my opponents are saying!
24方 18:20 Should good be repaid with evil? For they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before Thee To speak good on their behalf, So as to turn away Thy wrath from them.
24方 18:21 Therefore, give their children over to famine, And deliver them up to the power of the sword; And let their wives become childless and widowed. Let their men also be smitten to death, Their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
24方 18:22 May an outcry be heard from their houses, When Thou suddenly bringest raiders upon them; For they have dug a pit to capture me And hidden snares for my feet.
24方 18:23 Yet Thou, O LORD, knowest All their deadly designs against me; Do not forgive their iniquity Or blot out their sin from Thy sight. But may they be overthrown before Thee; Deal with them in the time of Thine anger!
24方 19:1 Thus says the LORD, "Go and buy a potter's earthenware jar, and [ take] some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests.
24方 19:2 "Then go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is by the entrance of the potsherd gate; and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you,
24方 19:3 and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem： thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, " Behold I am about to bring a calamity upon this place, at which the ears of everyone that hears of it will tingle.
24方 19:4 "Because they have forsaken Me and have made this an alien place and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had [ever] known, and [because] they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent
24方 19:5 and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I never commanded or spoke of, nor did it [ever] enter My mind;
24方 19:6 therefore, behold, days are coming, "declares the LORD," when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the valley of Slaughter.
24方 19:7 "And I shall make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I shall cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I shall give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
24方 19:8 "I shall also make this city a desolation and an [object of] hissing; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its disasters.
24方 19:9 "And I shall make them eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who seek their life will distress them." '
24方 19:10 "Then you are to break the jar in the sight of the men who accompany you
24方 19:11 and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Just so shall I break this people and this city, even as one breaks a potter's vessel, which cannot again be repaired; and they will bury in Topheth because there is no [other] place for burial.
24方 19:12 "This is how I shall treat this place and its inhabitants," declares the LORD, "so as to make this city like Topheth.
24方 19:13 "And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like the place Topheth, because of all the houses on whose rooftops they burned sacrifices to all the heavenly host and poured out libations to other gods." '"
24方 19:14 Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord's house and said to all the people：
24方 19:15 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire calamity that I have declared against it, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.'"
24方 20:1 When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,
24方 20:2 Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten, and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate, which was by the house of the LORD.
24方 20:3 Then it came about on the next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, that Jeremiah said to him, "Pashhur is not the name the LORD has called you, but rather Magor-missabib.
24方 20:4 "For thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword of their enemies. So I shall give over all Judah to the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will slay them with the sword.
24方 20:5 'I shall also give over all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and all its costly things; even all the treasures of the kings of Judah I shall give over to the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away, and bring them to Babylon.
24方 20:6 'And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.' "
24方 20:7 O LORD, Thou hast deceived me and I was deceived; Thou hast overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone mocks me.
24方 20:8 For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has resulted In reproach and derision all day long.
24方 20:9 But if I say, "I will not remember Him Or speak anymore in His name," Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut up in my bones; And I am weary of holding [it] in, And I cannot endure [it.]
24方 20:10 For I have heard the whispering of many, "Terror on every side! Denounce [him;] yes, let us denounce him!" All my trusted friends, Watching for my fall, say： "Perhaps he will be deceived, so that we may prevail against him And take our revenge on him."
24方 20:11 But the LORD is with me like a dread champion; Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be utterly ashamed, because they have failed, With an everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.
24方 20:12 Yet, O LORD of hosts, Thou who dost test the righteous, Who seest the mind and the heart; Let me see Thy vengeance on them; For to Thee I have set forth my cause.
24方 20:13 Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD! For He has delivered the soul of the needy one From the hand of evildoers.
24方 20:14 Cursed be the day when I was born; Let the day not be blessed when my mother bore me!
24方 20:15 Cursed be the man who brought the news To my father, saying, "A baby boy has been born to you!" [And] made him very happy.
24方 20:16 But let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew without relenting, And let him hear an outcry in the morning And a shout of alarm at noon;
24方 20:17 Because he did not kill me before birth, So that my mother would have been my grave, And her womb ever pregnant.
24方 20:18 Why did I ever come forth from the womb To look on trouble and sorrow, So that my days have been spent in shame?
24方 21:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,
24方 21:2 "Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful acts, that [the enemy] may withdraw from us."
24方 21:3 Then Jeremiah said to them, "You shall say to Zedekiah as follows：
24方 21:4 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, "Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I shall gather them into the center of this city.
24方 21:5 "And I Myself shall war against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in anger and wrath and great indignation.
24方 21:6 "I shall also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a great pestilence.
24方 21:7 "Then afterwards," declares the LORD, "I shall give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their foes, and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion." '
24方 21:8 "You shall also say to this people, 'Thus says the LORD," Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
24方 21:9 "He who dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty.
24方 21:10 "For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good," declares the LORD. "It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire." '
24方 21:11 "Then [say] to the household of the king of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD,
24方 21:12 O house of David, thus says the LORD： "Administer justice every morning; And deliver the [person] who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor, That My wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish [it,] Because of the evil of their deeds.
24方 21:13 "Behold, I am against you, O valley dweller, O rocky plain," declares the LORD, "You men who say, 'Who will come down against us? Or who will enter into our habitations?'
24方 21:14 "But I shall punish you according to the results of your deeds," declares the LORD, "And I shall kindle a fire in its forest That it may devour all its environs." '"
24方 22:1 Thus says the LORD, "Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word,
24方 22:2 and say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on David's throne, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates.
24方 22:3 'Thus says the LORD, "Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of [his] oppressor. Also do not mistreat [or] do violence to the stranger, the orphan, or the widow; and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
24方 22:4 "For if you men will indeed perform this thing, then kings will enter the gates of this house, sitting in David's place on his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, [even the king] himself and his servants and his people.
24方 22:5 "But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself," declares the LORD, "that this house will become a desolation." '"
24方 22:6 For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah： "You are [like] Gilead to Me, [Like] the summit of Lebanon; Yet most assuredly I shall make you like a wilderness, [Like] cities which are not inhabited.
24方 22:7 "For I shall set apart destroyers against you, Each with his weapons; And they will cut down your choicest cedars And throw [them] on the fire.
24方 22:8 "And many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this great city?'
24方 22:9 "Then they will answer, 'Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.'"
24方 22:10 Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him, [But] weep continually for the one who goes away; For he will never return Or see his native land.
24方 22:11 For thus says the LORD in regard to Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place, "He will never return there;
24方 22:12 but in the place where they led him captive, there he will die and not see this land again.
24方 22:13 "Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness And his upper rooms without justice, Who uses his neighbor's services without pay And does not give him his wages,
24方 22:14 Who says, 'I will build myself a roomy house With spacious upper rooms, And cut out its windows, Paneling [it] with cedar and painting [it] bright red.'
24方 22:15 "Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
24方 22:16 "He pled the cause of the afflicted and needy; Then it was well. Is not that what it means to know Me?" Declares the LORD.
24方 22:17 "But your eyes and your heart Are [intent] only upon your own dishonest gain, And on shedding innocent blood And on practicing oppression and extortion."
24方 22:18 Therefore thus says the LORD in regard to Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, "They will not lament for him： 'Alas, my brother!' or, 'Alas, sister!' They will not lament for him： 'Alas for the master!' or, ' Alas for his splendor! '
24方 22:19 "He will be buried with a donkey's burial, Dragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
24方 22:20 "Go up to Lebanon and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry out also from Abarim, For all your lovers have been crushed.
24方 22:21 "I spoke to you in your prosperity; But you said, 'I will not listen!' This has been your practice from your youth, That you have not obeyed My voice.
24方 22:22 "The wind will sweep away all your shepherds, And your lovers will go into captivity; Then you will surely be ashamed and humiliated Because of all your wickedness.
24方 22:23 "You who dwell in Lebanon, Nested in the cedars, How you will groan when pangs come upon you, Pain like a woman in childbirth!
24方 22:24 "As I live," declares the LORD, "even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet [ring] on My right hand, yet I would pull you off;
24方 22:25 and I shall give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
24方 22:26 "I shall hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die.
24方 22:27 "But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it.
24方 22:28 "Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out And cast into a land that they had not known?
24方 22:29 "O land, land, land, Hear the word of the LORD!
24方 22:30 "Thus says the LORD, 'Write this man down childless, A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.'"
24方 23:1 "Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!" declares the LORD.
24方 23:2 Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people： "You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them; behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds," declares the LORD.
24方 23:3 "Then I Myself shall gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and shall bring them back to their pasture; and they will be fruitful and multiply.
24方 23:4 "I shall also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing," declares the LORD.
24方 23:5 "Behold, [the] days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I shall raise up for David a righteous Branch; And He will reign as king and act wisely And do justice and righteousness in the land.
24方 23:6 "In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, 'The LORD our righteousness.'
24方 23:7 "Therefore behold, [the] days are coming," declares the LORD, "when they will no longer say, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt,'
24方 23:8 but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up and led back the descendants of the household of Israel from [the] north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.' Then they will live on their own soil. "
24方 23:9 As for the prophets： My heart is broken within me, All my bones tremble; I have become like a drunken man, Even like a man overcome with wine, Because of the LORD And because of His holy words.
24方 23:10 For the land is full of adulterers; For the land mourns because of the curse. The pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course also is evil, And their might is not right.
24方 23:11 "For both prophet and priest are polluted; Even in My house I have found their wickedness," declares the LORD.
24方 23:12 "Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I shall bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment," declares the LORD.
24方 23:13 "Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing： They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
24方 23:14 "Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing： The committing of adultery and walking in falsehood; And they strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one has turned back from his wickedness. All of them have become to Me like Sodom, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah.
24方 23:15 "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets, 'Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth into all the land.'"
24方 23:16 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into futility; They speak a vision of their own imagination, Not from the mouth of the LORD.
24方 23:17 "They keep saying to those who despise Me, 'The LORD has said," You will have peace"'; And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, They say, 'Calamity will not come upon you.'
24方 23:18 "But who has stood in the council of the LORD, That he should see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and listened?
24方 23:19 "Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone forth in wrath, Even a whirling tempest; It will swirl down on the head of the wicked.
24方 23:20 "The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.
24方 23:21 "I did not send [these] prophets, But they ran. I did not speak to them, But they prophesied.
24方 23:22 "But if they had stood in My council, Then they would have announced My words to My people, And would have turned them back from their evil way And from the evil of their deeds.
24方 23:23 "Am I a God who is near," declares the LORD, "And not a God far off?
24方 23:24 "Can a man hide himself in hiding places, So I do not see him?" declares the LORD. "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?" declares the LORD.
24方 23:25 "I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, 'I had a dream, I had a dream!'
24方 23:26 "How long? Is there [anything] in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, even [these] prophets of the deception of their own heart,
24方 23:27 who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?
24方 23:28 "The prophet who has a dream may relate [his] dream, but let him who has My word speak My word in truth. What does straw have [in common] with grain?" declares the LORD.
24方 23:29 "Is not My word like fire?" declares the LORD, "and like a hammer which shatters a rock?
24方 23:30 "Therefore behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who steal My words from each other.
24方 23:31 "Behold, I am against the prophets," declares the LORD, "who use their tongues and declare, '[The Lord] declares.'
24方 23:32 "Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams," declares the LORD, "and related them, and led My people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them or command them, nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit," declares the LORD.
24方 23:33 "Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you saying, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' then you shall say to them, 'What oracle?' The LORD declares, 'I shall abandon you.'
24方 23:34 "Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, 'The oracle of the LORD,' I shall bring punishment upon that man and his household.
24方 23:35 "Thus shall each of you say to his neighbor and to his brother, 'What has the LORD answered?' or, 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24方 23:36 "For you will no longer remember the oracle of the LORD, because every man's own word will become the oracle, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
24方 23:37 "Thus you will say to [that] prophet, 'What has the LORD answered you?' and, 'What has the LORD spoken?'
24方 23:38 "For if you say, 'The oracle of the LORD!' surely thus says the LORD, 'Because you said this word," The oracle of the LORD !"I have also sent to you, saying," You shall not say,' The oracle of the LORD !' "'
24方 23:39 "Therefore behold, I shall surely forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers.
24方 23:40 "And I will put an everlasting reproach on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten."
24方 24:1 After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me： behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD!
24方 24:2 One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten due to rottenness.
24方 24:3 Then the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Jeremiah?" And I said, "Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad [figs,] very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness."
24方 24:4 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24方 24:5 "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place [into] the land of the Chaldeans.
24方 24:6 'For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not pluck [them] up.
24方 24:7 'And I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.
24方 24:8 'But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness-- indeed, thus says the LORD-- so I will abandon Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and the ones who dwell in the land of Egypt.
24方 24:9 'And I will make them a terror [and an] evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I shall scatter them.
24方 24:10 'And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence upon them until they are destroyed from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.' "
24方 25:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
24方 25:2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
24方 25:3 "From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.
24方 25:4 "And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear,
24方 25:5 saying, 'Turn now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell on the land which the LORD has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever;
24方 25:6 and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm. '
24方 25:7 "Yet you have not listened to Me," declares the LORD, "in order that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.
24方 25:8 "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Because you have not obeyed My words,
24方 25:9 behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, 'declares the LORD,' and [I will send] to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them a horror, and a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
24方 25:10 'Moreover, I will take from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
24方 25:11 'And this whole land shall be a desolation and a horror, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
24方 25:12 'Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,' declares the LORD, 'for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
24方 25:13 'And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
24方 25:14 '(For many nations and great kings shall make slaves of them, even them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.)' "
24方 25:15 For thus the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me, "Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
24方 25:16 "And they shall drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them."
24方 25:17 Then I took the cup from the Lord's hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom the LORD sent me：
24方 25:18 Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings [and] its princes, to make them a ruin, a horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
24方 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people;
24方 25:20 and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (even Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);
24方 25:21 Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;
24方 25:22 and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea;
24方 25:23 and Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners [of their hair;]
24方 25:24 and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who dwell in the desert;
24方 25:25 and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
24方 25:26 and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are upon the face of the ground, and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
24方 25:27 "And you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel," Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more because of the sword which I will send among you. "'
24方 25:28 "And it will be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts:" You shall surely drink!
24方 25:29 "For behold, I am beginning to work calamity in [this] city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment; for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth," declares the LORD of hosts. '
24方 25:30 "Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them, 'The LORD will roar from on high, And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will shout like those who tread [the grapes,] Against all the inhabitants of the earth.
24方 25:31 'A clamor has come to the end of the earth, Because the LORD has a controversy with the nations. He is entering into judgment with all flesh; As for the wicked, He has given them to the sword,' declares the LORD. "
24方 25:32 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, evil is going forth From nation to nation, And a great storm is being stirred up From the remotest parts of the earth.
24方 25:33 "And those slain by the LORD on that day shall be from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, gathered, or buried; they shall be like dung on the face of the ground.
24方 25:34 "Wail, you shepherds, and cry; And wallow [in ashes,] you masters of the flock; For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come, And you shall fall like a choice vessel.
24方 25:35 "Flight shall perish from the shepherds, And escape from the masters of the flock.
24方 25:36 "[Hear] the sound of the cry of the shepherds, And the wailing of the masters of the flock! For the LORD is destroying their pasture,
24方 25:37 "And the peaceful folds are made silent Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
24方 25:38 "He has left His hiding place like the lion; For their land has become a horror Because of the fierceness of the oppressing [sword,] And because of His fierce anger."
24方 26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying,
24方 26:2 "Thus says the LORD, 'Stand in the court of the Lord's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, who have come to worship [in] the Lord's house, all the words that I have commanded you to speak to them. Do not omit a word!
24方 26:3 'Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.'
24方 26:4 "And you will say to them, 'Thus says the LORD," If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law, which I have set before you,
24方 26:5 to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened;
24方 26:6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth. "'"
24方 26:7 And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
24方 26:8 And when Jeremiah finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded [him] to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, "You must die!
24方 26:9 "Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD saying, 'This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
24方 26:10 And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and sat in the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord's [house.]
24方 26:11 Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, "A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city as you have heard in your hearing."
24方 26:12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, "The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
24方 26:13 "Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will change His mind about the misfortune which He has pronounced against you.
24方 26:14 "But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight.
24方 26:15 "Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing."
24方 26:16 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, "No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God."
24方 26:17 Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
24方 26:18 "Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus the LORD of hosts has said, "Zion will be plowed [as] a field, And Jerusalem will become ruins, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. "'
24方 26:19 "Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and the LORD changed His mind about the misfortune which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against ourselves."
24方 26:20 Indeed, there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD ,Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah.
24方 26:21 When King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard [ it,] and he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt.
24方 26:22 Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt： Elnathan the son of Achbor and [certain] men with him [went] into Egypt.
24方 26:23 And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who slew him with a sword, and cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
24方 26:24 But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death.
24方 27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying--
24方 27:2 thus says the LORD to me-- "Make for yourself bonds and yokes and put them on your neck,
24方 27:3 and send word to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the sons of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
24方 27:4 "And command them [to go] to their masters, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, thus you shall say to your masters,
24方 27:5 "I have made the earth, the men and the beasts which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight.
24方 27:6 "And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also the wild animals of the field to serve him.
24方 27:7 "And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.
24方 27:8 "And it will be, [that] the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence," declares the LORD, "until I have destroyed it by his hand.
24方 27:9 "But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon.'
24方 27:10 "For they prophesy a lie to you, in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish.
24方 27:11 "But the nation which will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land," declares the LORD ,"and they will till it and dwell in it." '"
24方 27:12 And I spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, "Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live!
24方 27:13 "Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine, and pestilence, as the LORD has spoken to that nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?
24方 27:14 "So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, 'You shall not serve the king of Babylon,' for they prophesy a lie to you;
24方 27:15 for I have not sent them, "declares the LORD," but they prophesy falsely in My name, in order that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you. "
24方 27:16 [Then] I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, "Thus says the LORD： Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, 'Behold, the vessels of the Lord's house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon'; for they are prophesying a lie to you.
24方 27:17 "Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
24方 27:18 "But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now entreat the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.
24方 27:19 "For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
24方 27:20 which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
24方 27:21 "Yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem,
24方 27:22 'They shall be carried to Babylon, and they shall be there until the day I visit them,' declares the LORD. 'Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.' "
24方 28:1 Now it came about in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
24方 28:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
24方 28:3 'Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the Lord's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
24方 28:4 'I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD,' for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. '"
24方 28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,
24方 28:6 and the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD CONFIRM YOUR WORDS WHICH YOU HAVE PROPHESIED TO BRING BACK THE VESSELS OF THE Lord's HOUSE AND ALL THE EXILES, FROM BABYLON TO THIS PLACE.
24方 28:7 "Yet hear now this word which I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people!
24方 28:8 "The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of calamity and of pestilence.
24方 28:9 "The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then that prophet will be known [as] one whom the LORD has truly sent."
24方 28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
24方 28:11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, "Thus says the LORD, 'Even so will I break within two full years, the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.'" Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
24方 28:12 And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
24方 28:13 "Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, 'Thus says the LORD," You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron. "
24方 28:14 'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. And I have also given him the beasts of the field."' "
24方 28:15 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, "Listen now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.
24方 28:16 "Therefore thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you have counseled rebellion against the LORD.'"
24方 28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died in the same year in the seventh month.
24方 29:1 Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24方 29:2 (This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)
24方 29:3 [The letter was sent] by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,
24方 29:4 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,
24方 29:5 'Build houses and live [in them;] and plant gardens, and eat their produce.
24方 29:6 'Take wives and become the fathers of sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there and do not decrease.
24方 29:7 'And seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf; for in its welfare you will have welfare.'
24方 29:8 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Do not let your prophets who are in your midst and your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams which they dream.
24方 29:9 'For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,' declares the LORD.
24方 29:10 "For thus says the LORD, 'When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place.
24方 29:11 'For I know the plans that I have for you,' declares the LORD, ' plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.
24方 29:12 'Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
24方 29:13 'And you will seek Me and find [Me,] when you search for Me with all your heart.
24方 29:14 'And I will be found by you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will restore your fortunes and will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.'
24方 29:15 "Because you have said, 'The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon'--
24方 29:16 for thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile--
24方 29:17 thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like split-open figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness.
24方 29:18 'And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine and with pestilence; and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and a horror, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
24方 29:19 because they have not listened to My words, 'declares the LORD,' which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,' declares the LORD.
24方 29:20 "You, therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24方 29:21 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name, 'Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes.
24方 29:22 'And because of them a curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, "May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,
24方 29:23 because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them; and I am He who knows, and am a witness, "declares the LORD. '"
24方 29:24 And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
24方 29:25 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
24方 29:26 "The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar,
24方 29:27 now then, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you?
24方 29:28 "For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, '[The exile] will be long; build houses and live [in them] and plant gardens and eat their produce.'" '"
24方 29:29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.
24方 29:30 Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 29:31 "Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite," Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie, "
24方 29:32 therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I am about to do to My people," declares the LORD, "because he has preached rebellion against the LORD." '"
24方 30:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24方 30:2 "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book.
24方 30:3 'For, behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.' The LORD says, 'I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall possess it.' "
24方 30:4 Now these are the words which the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah,
24方 30:5 "For thus says the LORD, 'I have heard a sound of terror, Of dread, and there is no peace.
24方 30:6 'Ask now, and see, If a male can give birth. Why do I see every man [With] his hands on his loins, as a woman in childbirth? And [why] have all faces turned pale?
24方 30:7 'Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; And it is the time of Jacob's distress, But he will be saved from it.
24方 30:8 'And it shall come about on that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break his yoke from off their neck, and will tear off their bonds; and strangers shall no longer make them their slaves.
24方 30:9 'But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24方 30:10 'And fear not, O Jacob My servant,' declares the LORD, 'And do not be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar, And your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, And no one shall make him afraid.
24方 30:11 'For I am with you,' declares the LORD, 'to save you; For I will destroy completely all the nations where I have scattered you, Only I will not destroy you completely. But I will chasten you justly, And will by no means leave you unpunished.'
24方 30:12 "For thus says the LORD, 'Your wound is incurable, And your injury is serious.
24方 30:13 'There is no one to plead your cause; [No] healing for [your] sore, No recovery for you.
24方 30:14 'All your lovers have forgotten you, They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the punishment of a cruel one, Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous.
24方 30:15 'Why do you cry out over your injury? Your pain is incurable. Because your iniquity is great And your sins are numerous, I have done these things to you.
24方 30:16 'Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; And those who plunder you shall be for plunder, And all who prey upon you I will give for prey.
24方 30:17 'For I will restore you to health And I will heal you of your wounds,' declares the LORD, 'Because they have called you an outcast, saying： "It is Zion; no one cares for her."'
24方 30:18 "Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob And have compassion on his dwelling places; And the city shall be rebuilt on its ruin, And the palace shall stand on its rightful place.
24方 30:19 'And from them shall proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who make merry; And I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; I will also honor them, and they shall not be insignificant.
24方 30:20 'Their children also shall be as formerly, And their congregation shall be established before Me; And I will punish all their oppressors.
24方 30:21 'And their leader shall be one of them, And their ruler shall come forth from their midst; And I will bring him near, and he shall approach Me; For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?' declares the LORD.
24方 30:22 'And you shall be My people, And I will be your God.' "
24方 30:23 Behold, the tempest of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, A sweeping tempest; It will burst on the head of the wicked.
24方 30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back, Until He has performed, and until He has accomplished The intent of His heart; In the latter days you will understand this.
24方 31:1 "At that time," declares the LORD, "I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people."
24方 31:2 Thus says the LORD, "The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness-- Israel, when it went to find its rest."
24方 31:3 The LORD appeared to him from afar, [saying,] "I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness.
24方 31:4 "Again I will build you, and you shall be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel! Again you shall take up your tambourines, And go forth to the dances of the merrymakers.
24方 31:5 "Again you shall plant vineyards On the hills of Samaria; The planters shall plant And shall enjoy [them.]
24方 31:6 "For there shall be a day when watchmen On the hills of Ephraim shall call out, 'Arise, and let us go up [to] Zion, To the LORD our God.'"
24方 31:7 For thus says the LORD, "Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, And shout among the chiefs of the nations; Proclaim, give praise, and say, ' O LORD, save Thy people, The remnant of Israel. '
24方 31:8 "Behold, I am bringing them from the north country, And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth, Among them the blind and the lame, The woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; A great company, they shall return here.
24方 31:9 "With weeping they shall come, And by supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk by streams of waters, On a straight path in which they shall not stumble; For I am a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My first-born."
24方 31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, And declare in the coastlands afar off, And say, "He who scattered Israel will gather him, And keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock."
24方 31:11 For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, And redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
24方 31:12 "And they shall come and shout for joy on the height of Zion, And they shall be radiant over the bounty of the LORD-- Over the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, And over the young of the flock and the herd; And their life shall be like a watered garden, And they shall never languish again.
24方 31:13 "Then the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, And the young men and the old, together, For I will turn their mourning into joy, And will comfort them, and give them joy for their sorrow.
24方 31:14 "And I will fill the soul of the priests with abundance, And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness," declares the LORD.
24方 31:15 Thus says the LORD, "A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation [ and] bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be comforted for her children, Because they are no more."
24方 31:16 Thus says the LORD, "Restrain your voice from weeping, And your eyes from tears; For your work shall be rewarded," declares the LORD, " And they shall return from the land of the enemy.
24方 31:17 "And there is hope for your future," declares the LORD, "And [your] children shall return to their own territory.
24方 31:18 "I have surely heard Ephraim grieving, 'Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, Like an untrained calf; Bring me back that I may be restored, For Thou art the LORD my God.
24方 31:19 'For after I turned back, I repented; And after I was instructed, I smote on [my] thigh; I was ashamed, and also humiliated, Because I bore the reproach of my youth.'
24方 31:20 "Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? Indeed, as often as I have spoken against him, I certainly [still] remember him; Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him," declares the LORD.
24方 31:21 "Set up for yourself roadmarks, Place for yourself guideposts; Direct your mind to the highway, The way by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these your cities.
24方 31:22 "How long will you go here and there, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth-- A woman will encompass a man."
24方 31:23 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I restore their fortunes, 'The LORD bless you, O abode of righteousness, O holy hill!'
24方 31:24 "And Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmer and they who go about with flocks.
24方 31:25 "For I satisfy the weary ones and refresh everyone who languishes."
24方 31:26 At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
24方 31:27 "Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast.
24方 31:28 "And it will come about that as I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant," declares the LORD.
24方 31:29 "In those days they will not say again, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge.'
24方 31:30 "But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.
24方 31:31 "Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
24方 31:32 not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, "declares the LORD.
24方 31:33 "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days," declares the LORD, "I will put My law within them, and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
24方 31:34 "And they shall not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them," declares the LORD, "for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
24方 31:35 Thus says the LORD, Who gives the sun for light by day, And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar; The LORD of hosts is His name：
24方 31:36 "If this fixed order departs From before Me," declares the LORD, " Then the offspring of Israel also shall cease From being a nation before Me forever. "
24方 31:37 Thus says the LORD, "If the heavens above can be measured, And the foundations of the earth searched out below, Then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel For all that they have done," declares the LORD.
24方 31:38 "Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24方 31:39 "And the measuring line shall go out farther straight ahead to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah.
24方 31:40 "And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, or overthrown anymore forever."
24方 32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
24方 32:2 Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was [in] the house of the king of Judah,
24方 32:3 because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, "Why do you prophesy, saying, 'Thus says the LORD," Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;
24方 32:4 and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye;
24方 32:5 and he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he shall be there until I visit him, "declares the LORD." If you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed "'?"
24方 32:6 And Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
24方 32:7 'Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, "Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy [it.]"'
24方 32:8 "Then Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, 'Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy [it] for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
24方 32:9 "And I bought the field which was at Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver.
24方 32:10 "And I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
24方 32:11 "Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed [copy containing] the terms and conditions, and the open [copy;]
24方 32:12 and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's [son,] and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.
24方 32:13 "And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,
24方 32:14 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase, and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, that they may last a long time."
24方 32:15 'For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land."'
24方 32:16 "After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, then I prayed to the LORD, saying,
24方 32:17 'Ah Lord GOD! Behold, Thou hast made the heavens and the earth by Thy great power and by Thine outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for Thee,
24方 32:18 who showest lovingkindness to thousands, but repayest the iniquity of fathers into the bosom of their children after them, O great and mighty God. The LORD of hosts is His name;
24方 32:19 great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;
24方 32:20 who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, [and] even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and Thou hast made a name for Thyself, as at this day.
24方 32:21 'And Thou didst bring Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
24方 32:22 and gavest them this land, which Thou didst swear to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
24方 32:23 'And they came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Thy voice or walk in Thy law; they have done nothing of all that Thou commandedst them to do; therefore Thou hast made all this calamity come upon them.
24方 32:24 'Behold, the siege mounds have reached the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence; and what Thou hast spoken has come to pass; and, behold, Thou seest [it.]
24方 32:25 'And Thou hast said to me, O Lord GOD, "Buy for yourself the field with money, and call in witnesses"-- although the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.' "
24方 32:26 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 32:27 "Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?"
24方 32:28 Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am about to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
24方 32:29 "And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where [people] have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out libations to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
24方 32:30 "Indeed the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands," declares the LORD.
24方 32:31 "Indeed this city has been to Me [a provocation of] My anger and My wrath from the day that they built it, even to this day, that it should be removed from before My face,
24方 32:32 because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger-- they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
24方 32:33 "And they have turned [their] back to Me, and not [their] face; though [I] taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen and receive instruction.
24方 32:34 "But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
24方 32:35 "And they built the high places of Baal that are in the valley of Ben-hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
24方 32:36 "Now therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, 'It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence.'
24方 32:37 "Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety.
24方 32:38 "And they shall be My people, and I will be their God;
24方 32:39 and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good, and for [the good of] their children after them.
24方 32:40 "And I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me.
24方 32:41 "And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.
24方 32:42 "For thus says the LORD, 'Just as I brought all this great disaster on this people, so I am going to bring on them all the good that I am promising them.
24方 32:43 'And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, "It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
24方 32:44 'Men shall buy fields for money, sign and seal deeds, and call in witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the Negev; for I will restore their fortunes,' declares the LORD. "
24方 33:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the court of the guard, saying,
24方 33:2 "Thus says the LORD who made [the earth,] the LORD who formed it to establish it, the LORD is His name,
24方 33:3 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.'
24方 33:4 "For thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down [to make a defense] against the siege mounds and against the sword,
24方 33:5 'While [they] are coming to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My wrath, and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness：
24方 33:6 'Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.
24方 33:7 'And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as they were at first.
24方 33:8 'And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against Me, and by which they have transgressed against Me.
24方 33:9 'And it shall be to Me a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear of all the good that I do for them, and they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.'
24方 33:10 "Thus says the LORD, 'Yet again there shall be heard in this place, of which you say," It is a waste, without man and without beast, "[ that is,] in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,
24方 33:11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, "Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His lovingkindness is everlasting"; [and of those] who bring a thank offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first, 'says the LORD.
24方 33:12 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'There shall again be in this place which is waste, without man or beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who rest their flocks.
24方 33:13 'In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who numbers them,' says the LORD.
24方 33:14 'Behold, days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24方 33:15 'In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch of David to spring forth; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.
24方 33:16 'In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety; and this is [the name] by which she shall be called： the LORD is our righteousness.'
24方 33:17 "For thus says the LORD, 'David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
24方 33:18 and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices continually. '"
24方 33:19 And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 33:20 "Thus says the LORD, 'If you can break My covenant for the day, and My covenant for the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time,
24方 33:21 then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers.
24方 33:22 'As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.' "
24方 33:23 And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 33:24 "Have you not observed what this people have spoken, saying, 'The two families which the LORD chose, He has rejected them'? Thus they despise My people, no longer are they as a nation in their sight.
24方 33:25 "Thus says the LORD, 'If My covenant [for] day and night [stand] not, [and] the fixed patterns of heaven and earth I have not established,
24方 33:26 then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them. '"
24方 34:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,
24方 34:2 "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him:" Thus says the LORD,' Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.
24方 34:3 'And you will not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.' "'
24方 34:4 "Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you, 'You will not die by the sword.
24方 34:5 'You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will lament for you, "Alas, lord!"' For I have spoken the word, "declares the LORD.
24方 34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
24方 34:7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah, [that is], Lachish and Azekah, for they [alone] remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah.
24方 34:8 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them：
24方 34:9 that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep them, a Jew his brother, in bondage.
24方 34:10 And all the officials and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant that each man should set free his male servant and each man his female servant, so that no one should keep them any longer in bondage; they obeyed, and set [them free.]
24方 34:11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants, whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection for male servants and for female servants.
24方 34:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24方 34:13 "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying,
24方 34:14 "At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother, who has been sold to you and has served you six years, you shall send him out free from you; but your forefathers did not obey Me, or incline their ear to Me.
24方 34:15 "Although recently you [had] turned and done what is right in My sight, each man proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.
24方 34:16 "Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each man took back his male servant and each man his female servant, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male servants and female servants." '
24方 34:17 "Therefore thus says the LORD, 'You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release each man to his brother, and each man to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,' declares the LORD, 'to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24方 34:18 'And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, [when] they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts--
24方 34:19 the officials of Judah, and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf--
24方 34:20 and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
24方 34:21 'And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has gone away from you.
24方 34:22 'Behold, I am going to command,' declares the LORD, 'and I will bring them back to this city; and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.' "
24方 35:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
24方 35:2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink."
24方 35:3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,
24方 35:4 and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.
24方 35:5 Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, "Drink wine!"
24方 35:6 But they said, "We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever.
24方 35:7 'And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one; but in tents you shall dwell all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.'
24方 35:8 "And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
24方 35:9 nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed.
24方 35:10 "We have only dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and have done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
24方 35:11 "But it came about, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, that we said, 'Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans and before the army of the Arameans.' So we have dwelt in Jerusalem."
24方 35:12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 35:13 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Go and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem," Will you not receive instruction by listening to My words? "declares the LORD.
24方 35:14 "The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are observed. So they do not drink [wine] to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me.
24方 35:15 "Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending [them] again and again, saying： 'Turn now every man from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to worship them, then you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me.
24方 35:16 'Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have observed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.' "'
24方 35:17 "Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.'"
24方 35:18 Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands, and done according to all that he commanded you;
24方 35:19 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me always." '"
24方 36:1 And it came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
24方 36:2 "Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel, and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I [first] spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
24方 36:3 "Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the calamity which I plan to bring on them, in order that every man will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin."
24方 36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll.
24方 36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the LORD.
24方 36:6 "So you go and read from the scroll which you have written at my dictation the words of the LORD to the people in the Lord's house on a fast day. And also you shall read them to all [the people of] Judah who come from their cities.
24方 36:7 "Perhaps their supplication will come before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."
24方 36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the Lord's house.
24方 36:9 Now it came about in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
24方 36:10 Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house, to all the people.
24方 36:11 Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the LORD from the book,
24方 36:12 he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's chamber. And, behold, all the officials were sitting there-- Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the [other] officials.
24方 36:13 And Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read from the book to the people.
24方 36:14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come." So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them.
24方 36:15 And they said to him, "Sit down please, and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
24方 36:16 Now it came about when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch, "We will surely report all these words to the king."
24方 36:17 And they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us please, how did you write all these words? [Was it] at his dictation?"
24方 36:18 Then Baruch said to them, "He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book."
24方 36:19 Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are."
24方 36:20 So they went to the king in the court, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they reported all the words to the king.
24方 36:21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king.
24方 36:22 Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with [a fire] burning in the brazier before him.
24方 36:23 And it came about, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, [the king] cut it with a scribe's knife and threw [it] into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
24方 36:24 Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.
24方 36:25 Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah entreated the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24方 36:26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
24方 36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,
24方 36:28 "Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
24方 36:29 "And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD," You have burned this scroll, saying,' Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall make man and beast to cease from it? '"
24方 36:30 'Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, "He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.
24方 36:31 "I shall also punish him and his descendants and his servants for their iniquity, and I shall bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the calamity that I have declared to them-- but they did not listen." '"
24方 36:32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neraiah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.
24方 37:1 Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
24方 37:2 But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
24方 37:3 Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, " Please pray to the LORD our God on our behalf. "
24方 37:4 Now Jeremiah was [still] coming in and going out among the people, for they had not [yet] put him in the prison.
24方 37:5 Meanwhile, Pharaoh's army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they lifted the [siege] from Jerusalem.
24方 37:6 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
24方 37:7 "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Thus you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me:" Behold, Pharaoh's army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of Egypt.
24方 37:8 "The Chaldeans will also return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire." '
24方 37:9 "Thus says the LORD, 'Do not deceive yourselves, saying," The Chaldeans will surely go away from us, "for they will not go.
24方 37:10 'For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were [only] wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.' "
24方 37:11 Now it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans had lifted [the siege] from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
24方 37:12 that Jeremiah went out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of [some] property there among the people.
24方 37:13 While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are going over to the Chaldeans!"
24方 37:14 But Jeremiah said, "A lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans"; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24方 37:15 Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into the prison.
24方 37:16 For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
24方 37:17 Now King Zedekiah sent and took him [out;] and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, "Is there a word from the LORD?" And Jeremiah said, "There is!" Then he said, "You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!"
24方 37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, "[In] what [way] have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
24方 37:19 "Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land'?
24方 37:20 "But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my petition come before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, that I may not die there."
24方 37:21 Then King Zedekiah gave commandment, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guardhouse and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guardhouse.
24方 38:1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,
24方 38:2 "Thus says the LORD, 'He who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live and have his [own] life as booty and stay alive.'
24方 38:3 "Thus says the LORD, 'This city will certainly be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'"
24方 38:4 Then the officials said to the king, "Now let this man be put to death, inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them; for this man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but rather their harm."
24方 38:5 So King Zedekiah said, "Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can [do] nothing against you."
24方 38:6 Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern [of] Malchijah the king's son, which was in the court of the guardhouse; and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.
24方 38:7 But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king's palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin;
24方 38:8 and Ebed-melech went out from the king's palace and spoke to the king, saying,
24方 38:9 "My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city."
24方 38:10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, "Take thirty men from here under your authority, and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies."
24方 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king's palace to [a place] beneath the storeroom and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.
24方 38:12 Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes"; and Jeremiah did so.
24方 38:13 So they pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse.
24方 38:14 Then King Zedekiah sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said to Jeremiah, "I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me."
24方 38:15 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me."
24方 38:16 But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret saying, "As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, surely I will not put you to death nor will I give you over to the hand of these men who are seeking your life."
24方 38:17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "Thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, 'If you will indeed go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive.
24方 38:18 'But if you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.' "
24方 38:19 Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I dread the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, lest they give me over into their hand and they abuse me."
24方 38:20 But Jeremiah said, "They will not give you over. Please obey the LORD in what I am saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live.
24方 38:21 "But if you keep refusing to go out, this is the word which the LORD has shown me：
24方 38:22 'Then behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say, "Your close friends Have misled and overpowered you; While your feet were sunk in the mire, They turned back."
24方 38:23 'They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.' "
24方 38:24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Let no man know about these words and you will not die.
24方 38:25 "But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us now what you said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide [it] from us, and we will not put you to death,'
24方 38:26 then you are to say to them, 'I was presenting my petition before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.' "
24方 38:27 Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they ceased speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard.
24方 38:28 So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
24方 39:1 Now it came about when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;
24方 39:2 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth [day] of the month, the city [wall] was breached.
24方 39:3 Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate： Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer [the] Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
24方 39:4 And it came about, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.
24方 39:5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
24方 39:6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slew all the nobles of Judah.
24方 39:7 He then blinded Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon.
24方 39:8 The Chaldeans also burned with fire the king's palace and the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24方 39:9 And as for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried [them] into exile in Babylon.
24方 39:10 But some of the poorest people who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
24方 39:11 Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying,
24方 39:12 "Take him and look after him, and do nothing harmful to him; but rather deal with him just as he tells you."
24方 39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent [word,] along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon;
24方 39:14 they even sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people.
24方 39:15 Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the court of the guardhouse, saying,
24方 39:16 "Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel," Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day.
24方 39:17 "But I will deliver you on that day," declares the LORD, "and you shall not be given into the hand of the men whom you dread.
24方 39:18 "For I will certainly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your [own] life as booty, because you have trusted in Me," declares the LORD. '"
24方 40:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the bodyguard had released him from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains, among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah, who were being exiled to Babylon.
24方 40:2 Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, "The LORD your God promised this calamity against this place;
24方 40:3 and the LORD has brought [it] on and done just as He promised. Because you [people] sinned against the LORD and did not listen to His voice, therefore this thing has happened to you.
24方 40:4 "But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains which are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come [along,] and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, never mind. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go."
24方 40:5 As Jeremiah was still not going back, [he said,] "Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go." So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift and let him go.
24方 40:6 Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
24方 40:7 Now all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon.
24方 40:8 So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, [both] they and their men.
24方 40:9 Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, "Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you.
24方 40:10 "Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay at Mizpah to stand [for you] before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather in wine and summer fruit and oil, and put [them] in your [storage] vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over."
24方 40:11 Likewise also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom, and who were in all the [other] countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
24方 40:12 Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance.
24方 40:13 Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,
24方 40:14 and said to him, "Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.
24方 40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, "Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and not a man will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish?"
24方 40:16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, " Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael. "
24方 41:1 Now it came about in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and [one] of the chief officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah,
24方 41:2 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
24方 41:3 Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, [that is] with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
24方 41:4 Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about [it,]
24方 41:5 that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off and their clothes torn and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the LORD.
24方 41:6 Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and it came about as he met them that he said to them, "Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!"
24方 41:7 Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men that were with him slaughtered them, [and cast them] into the cistern.
24方 41:8 But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, "Do not put us to death; for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden in the field." So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions.
24方 41:9 Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had cast all the corpses of the men whom he had struck down because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
24方 41:10 Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the charge of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; thus Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon.
24方 41:11 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.
24方 41:12 So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
24方 41:13 Now it came about, as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were glad.
24方 41:14 So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
24方 41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.
24方 41:16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [that is,] the men who were soldiers, [the] women, [the] children, and [the] eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
24方 41:17 And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt
24方 41:18 because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
24方 42:1 Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great approached
24方 42:2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Please let our petition come before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, [that is] for all this remnant; because we are left [but] a few out of many, as your own eyes [now] see us,
24方 42:3 that the LORD your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing that we should do. "
24方 42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard [you.] Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with your words; and it will come about that the whole message which the LORD will answer you I will tell you. I will not keep back a word from you."
24方 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the LORD your God will send you to us.
24方 42:6 "Whether [it] is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, in order that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God."
24方 42:7 Now it came about at the end of ten days that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
24方 42:8 Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people both small and great,
24方 42:9 and said to them, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him：
24方 42:10 'If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I shall relent concerning the calamity that I have inflicted on you.
24方 42:11 'Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are [now] fearing; do not be afraid of him,' declares the LORD, 'for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand.
24方 42:12 'I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil.
24方 42:13 'But if you are going to say, "We will not stay in this land," so as not to listen to the voice of the LORD your God,
24方 42:14 saying, "No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or hear the sound of a trumpet or hunger for bread, and we will stay there";
24方 42:15 then in that case listen to the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "If you really set your mind to enter Egypt, and go in to reside there,
24方 42:16 then it will come about that the sword, which you are afraid of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there [in] Egypt; and you will die there.
24方 42:17 "So all the men who set their mind to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; and they will have no survivors or refugees from the calamity that I am going to bring on them." ' "
24方 42:18 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "As My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more."
24方 42:19 The LORD has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, "Do not go into Egypt!" You should clearly understand that today I have testified against you.
24方 42:20 For you have [only] deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, "Pray for us to the LORD our God; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us so, and we will do it."
24方 42:21 So, I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the LORD your God, even in whatever He has sent me to [tell] you.
24方 42:22 Therefore you should now clearly understand that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, in the place where you wish to go to reside.
24方 43:1 But it came about, as soon as Jeremiah whom the LORD their God had sent, had finished telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God-- that is, all these words--
24方 43:2 that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You are telling a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'You are not to enter Egypt to reside there';
24方 43:3 but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to give us over into the hand of the Chaldeans, so they may put us to death or exile us to Babylon. "
24方 43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the LORD, so as to stay in the land of Judah.
24方 43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been driven away, in order to reside in the land of Judah--
24方 43:6 the men, the women, the children, the king's daughters and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah--
24方 43:7 and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the LORD) and went in as far as Tahpanhes.
24方 43:8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
24方 43:9 "Take [some] large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick [terrace] which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some [of the] Jews;
24方 43:10 and say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "Behold, I am going to send and get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and I am going to set his throne [right] over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them.
24方 43:11 "He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are [meant] for death [will be given over] to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword.
24方 43:12 "And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely.
24方 43:13 "He will also shatter the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire." '"
24方 44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying,
24方 44:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them,
24方 44:3 because of their wickedness which they committed so as to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices [and] to serve other gods whom they had not known, [neither] they, you, nor your fathers.
24方 44:4 'Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets, again and again, saying, "Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate."
24方 44:5 'But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods.
24方 44:6 'Therefore My wrath and My anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become a ruin and a desolation as it is this day.
24方 44:7 'Now then thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, "Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, so as to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah, leaving yourselves without remnant,
24方 44:8 provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are entering to reside, so that you might be cut off and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
24方 44:9 "Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
24方 44:10 "But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before you and before your fathers." '
24方 44:11 "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am going to set My face against you for woe, even to cut off all Judah.
24方 44:12 'And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword [and] meet their end by famine. Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach.
24方 44:13 'And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence.
24方 44:14 'So there will be no refugees or survivors for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return and live; for none will return except [a few] refugees.' "
24方 44:15 Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, [as] a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying,
24方 44:16 "As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD ,we are not going to listen to you!
24方 44:17 "But rather we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for [then] we had plenty of food, and were well off, and saw no misfortune.
24方 44:18 "But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and by famine."
24方 44:19 "And," [said the women,] "when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven, and were pouring out libations to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her [sacrificial] cakes in her image and poured out libations to her?"
24方 44:20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women-- even to all the people who were giving him [such] an answer-- saying,
24方 44:21 "As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and did not [all this] come into His mind?
24方 44:22 "So the LORD was no longer able to endure [it,] because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an inhabitant, as [it is] this day.
24方 44:23 "Because you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, His statutes or His testimonies, therefore this calamity has befallen you, as [it has] this day."
24方 44:24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, "Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt,
24方 44:25 thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, as follows： 'As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled [ it] with your hands, saying, "We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her." Go ahead and confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!'
24方 44:26 "Nevertheless hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt, 'Behold, I have sworn by My great name,' says the LORD, 'never shall My name be invoked again by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying," As the Lord GOD lives. "
24方 44:27 'Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword and by famine until they are completely gone.
24方 44:28 'And those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs.
24方 44:29 'And this will be the sign to you,' declares the LORD, 'that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for harm.'
24方 44:30 "Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I am going to give over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt to the hand of his enemies, to the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave over Zedekiah king of Judah to the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, [who was] his enemy and was seeking his life.'"
24方 45:1 [This is] the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written down these words in a book at Jeremiah's dictation, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying：
24方 45:2 "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel to you, O Baruch：
24方 45:3 'You said, "Ah, woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest."'
24方 45:4 "Thus you are to say to him, 'Thus says the LORD," Behold, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to uproot, that is, the whole land. "
24方 45:5 'But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek [them;] for behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,' declares the LORD, 'but I will give your life to you as booty in all the places where you may go.' "
24方 46:1 That which came as the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
24方 46:2 To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah：
24方 46:3 "Line up the shield and buckler, And draw near for the battle!
24方 46:4 "Harness the horses, And mount the steeds, And take your stand with helmets [on!] Polish the spears, Put on the scale-armor!
24方 46:5 "Why have I seen [it?] They are terrified, They are drawing back, And their mighty men are defeated And have taken refuge in flight, Without facing back; Terror is on every side!" Declares the LORD.
24方 46:6 Let not the swift man flee, Nor the mighty man escape; In the north beside the river Euphrates They have stumbled and fallen.
24方 46:7 Who is this that rises like the Nile, Like the rivers whose waters surge about?
24方 46:8 Egypt rises like the Nile, Even like the rivers whose waters surge about; And He has said, "I will rise and cover [that] land; I will surely destroy the city and its inhabitants."
24方 46:9 Go up, you horses, and drive madly, you chariots, That the mighty men may march forward： Ethiopia and Put, that handle the shield, And the Lydians, that handle [and] bend the bow.
24方 46:10 For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of hosts, A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes; And the sword will devour and be satiated And drink its fill of their blood; For there will be a slaughter for the Lord GOD of hosts, In the land of the north by the river Euphrates.
24方 46:11 Go up to Gilead and obtain balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain have you multiplied remedies; There is no healing for you.
24方 46:12 The nations have heard of your shame, And the earth is full of your cry [of distress;] For one warrior has stumbled over another, And both of them have fallen down together.
24方 46:13 [This is] the message which the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt：
24方 46:14 "Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol, Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes; Say, 'Take your stand and get yourself ready, For the sword has devoured those around you.'
24方 46:15 "Why have your mighty ones become prostrate? They do not stand because the LORD has thrust them down.
24方 46:16 "They have repeatedly stumbled; Indeed, they have fallen one against another. Then they said, 'Get up! And let us go back To our own people and our native land Away from the sword of the oppressor.'
24方 46:17 "They cried there, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt [is but] a big noise; He has let the appointed time pass by!'
24方 46:18 "As I live," declares the King Whose name is the LORD of hosts, " Surely one shall come [who looms up] like Tabor among the mountains, Or like Carmel by the sea.
24方 46:19 "Make your baggage ready for exile, O daughter dwelling in Egypt, For Memphis will become a desolation; It will even be burned down [and] bereft of inhabitants.
24方 46:20 "Egypt is a pretty heifer, [But] a horsefly is coming from the north-- it is coming!
24方 46:21 "Also her mercenaries in her midst Are like fattened calves, For even they too have turned back [and] have fled away together; They did not stand [their ground.] For the day of their calamity has come upon them, The time of their punishment.
24方 46:22 "Its sound moves along like a serpent; For they move on like an army And come to her as woodcutters with axes.
24方 46:23 "They have cut down her forest," declares the LORD; "Surely it will no [more] be found, Even though they are [now] more numerous than locusts And are without number.
24方 46:24 "The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame, Given over to the power of the people of the north."
24方 46:25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says, "Behold, I am going to punish Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh, and Egypt along with her gods and her kings, even Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
24方 46:26 "And I shall give them over to the power of those who are seeking their lives, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of his officers. Afterwards, however, it will be inhabited as in the days of old," declares the LORD.
24方 46:27 "But as for you, O Jacob My servant, do not fear, Nor be dismayed, O Israel! For, see, I am going to save you from afar, And your descendants from the land of their captivity; And Jacob shall return and be undisturbed And secure, with no one making [him] tremble.
24方 46:28 "O Jacob My servant, do not fear," declares the LORD, "For I am with you. For I shall make a full end of all the nations Where I have driven you, Yet I shall not make a full end of you; But I shall correct you properly And by no means leave you unpunished."

For who is like Me, and who will summon Me [into court?] And who then is the shepherd who can stand before Me?"
24方 50:45 Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Babylon, and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans： surely they will drag them off, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.
24方 50:46 At the shout, "Babylon has been seized!" the earth is shaken, and an outcry is heard among the nations.
24方 51:1 Thus says the LORD： "Behold, I am going to arouse against Babylon And against the inhabitants of Leb-kamai The spirit of a destroyer.
24方 51:2 "And I shall dispatch foreigners to Babylon that they may winnow her And may devastate her land; For on every side they will be opposed to her In the day of [her] calamity.
24方 51:3 "Let not him who bends his bow bend [it,] Nor let him rise up in his scale-armor; So do not spare her young men; Devote all her army to destruction.
24方 51:4 "And they will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, And pierced through in their streets."
24方 51:5 For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken By his God, the LORD of hosts, Although their land is full of guilt Before the Holy One of Israel.
24方 51:6 Flee from the midst of Babylon, And each of you save his life! Do not be destroyed in her punishment, For this is the Lord's time of vengeance; He is going to render recompense to her.
24方 51:7 Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the LORD, Intoxicating all the earth. The nations have drunk of her wine; Therefore the nations are going mad.
24方 51:8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken; Wail over her! Bring balm for her pain; Perhaps she may be healed.
24方 51:9 We applied healing to Babylon, but she was not healed; Forsake her and let us each go to his own country, For her judgment has reached to heaven And towers up to the very skies.
24方 51:10 The LORD has brought about our vindication; Come and let us recount in Zion The work of the LORD our God!
24方 51:11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! The LORD has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes, Because His purpose is against Babylon to destroy it; For it is the vengeance of the LORD, vengeance for His temple.
24方 51:12 Lift up a signal against the walls of Babylon; Post a strong guard, Station sentries, Place men in ambush! For the LORD has both purposed and performed What He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
24方 51:13 O you who dwell by many waters, Abundant in treasures, Your end has come, The measure of your end.
24方 51:14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by Himself： "Surely I will fill you with a population like locusts, And they will cry out with shouts of victory over you."
24方 51:15 [It is] He who made the earth by His power, Who established the world by His wisdom, And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.
24方 51:16 When He utters His voice, [there is] a tumult of waters in the heavens, And He causes the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, And brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
24方 51:17 All mankind is stupid, devoid of knowledge; Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, For his molten images are deceitful, And there is no breath in them.
24方 51:18 They are worthless, a work of mockery; In the time of their punishment they will perish.
24方 51:19 The portion of Jacob is not like these; For the Maker of all is He, And of the tribe of His inheritance; The LORD of hosts is His name.
24方 51:20 [He says,] "You are My war-club, [My] weapon of war; And with you I shatter nations, And with you I destroy kingdoms.
24方 51:21 "And with you I shatter the horse and his rider,
24方 51:22 And with you I shatter the chariot and its rider, And with you I shatter man and woman, And with you I shatter old man and youth, And with you I shatter young man and virgin,
24方 51:23 And with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock, And with you I shatter the farmer and his team, And with you I shatter governors and prefects.
24方 51:24 "But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes," declares the LORD.
24方 51:25 "Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, Who destroys the whole earth," declares the LORD, "And I will stretch out My hand against you, And roll you down from the crags And I will make you a burnt out mountain.
24方 51:26 "And they will not take from you [even] a stone for a corner Nor a stone for foundations, But you will be desolate forever," declares the LORD.
24方 51:27 Lift up a signal in the land, Blow a trumpet among the nations! Consecrate the nations against her, Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; Appoint a marshal against her, Bring up the horses like bristly locusts.
24方 51:28 Consecrate the nations against her, The kings of the Medes, Their governors and all their prefects, And every land of their dominion.
24方 51:29 So the land quakes and writhes, For the purposes of the LORD against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without inhabitants.
24方 51:30 The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting, They stay in the strongholds; Their strength is exhausted, They are becoming [like] women; Their dwelling places are set on fire, The bars of her [gates] are broken.
24方 51:31 One courier runs to meet another, And one messenger to meet another, To tell the king of Babylon That his city has been captured from end [to end;]
24方 51:32 The fords also have been seized, And they have burned the marshes with fire, And the men of war are terrified.
24方 51:33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel： "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor At the time it is stamped firm; Yet in a little while the time of harvest will come for her."
24方 51:34 "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me [and] crushed me, He has set me down [like] an empty vessel; He has swallowed me like a monster, He has filled his stomach with my delicacies; He has washed me away.
24方 51:35 "May the violence [done] to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon," The inhabitant of Zion will say; And, "May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea," Jerusalem will say.
24方 51:36 Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am going to plead your case And exact full vengeance for you; And I shall dry up her sea And make her fountain dry.
24方 51:37 "And Babylon will become a heap [of ruins,] a haunt of jackals, An object of horror and hissing, without inhabitants.
24方 51:38 "They will roar together like young lions, They will growl like lions' cubs.
24方 51:39 "When they become heated up, I shall serve [them] their banquet And make them drunk, that they may become jubilant And may sleep a perpetual sleep And not wake up," declares the LORD.
24方 51:40 "I shall bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, Like rams together with male goats.
24方 51:41 "How Sheshak has been captured, And the praise of the whole earth been seized! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!
24方 51:42 "The sea has come up over Babylon; She has been engulfed with its tumultuous waves.
24方 51:43 "Her cities have become an object of horror, A parched land and a desert, A land in which no man lives, And through which no son of man passes.
24方 51:44 "And I shall punish Bel in Babylon, And I shall make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth; And the nations will no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Babylon has fallen down!
24方 51:45 "Come forth from her midst, My people, And each of you save yourselves From the fierce anger of the LORD.
24方 51:46 "Now lest your heart grow faint, And you be afraid at the report that [will be] heard in the land-- For the report will come one year, And after that another report in another year, And violence [will be] in the land With ruler against ruler--
24方 51:47 Therefore behold, days are coming When I shall punish the idols of Babylon; And her whole land will be put to shame, And all her slain will fall in her midst.
24方 51:48 "Then heaven and earth and all that is in them Will shout for joy over Babylon, For the destroyers will come to her from the north," Declares the LORD.
24方 51:49 Indeed Babylon is to fall [for] the slain of Israel, [As] also for Babylon the slain of all the earth have fallen.
24方 51:50 You who have escaped the sword, Depart! Do not stay! Remember the LORD from afar, And let Jerusalem come to your mind.
24方 51:51 We are ashamed because we have heard reproach; Disgrace has covered our faces, For aliens have entered The holy places of the Lord's house.
24方 51:52 "Therefore behold, the days are coming," declares the LORD, "When I shall punish her idols, And the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land.
24方 51:53 "Though Babylon should ascend to the heavens, And though she should fortify her lofty stronghold, From Me destroyers will come to her," declares the LORD.
24方 51:54 The sound of an outcry from Babylon, And of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
24方 51:55 For the LORD is going to destroy Babylon, And He will make [her] loud noise vanish from her. And their waves will roar like many waters; The tumult of their voices sounds forth.
24方 51:56 For the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, And her mighty men will be captured, Their bows are shattered; For the LORD is a God of recompense, He will fully repay.
24方 51:57 "And I shall make her princes and her wise men drunk, Her governors, her prefects, and her mighty men, That they may sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up," Declares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
24方 51:58 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "The broad wall of Babylon will be completely razed, And her high gates will be set on fire; So the peoples will toil for nothing, And the nations become exhausted [only] for fire."
24方 51:59 The message which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (Now Seraiah was quartermaster.)
24方 51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a single scroll all the calamity which would come upon Babylon, [that is,] all these words which have been written concerning Babylon.
24方 51:61 Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "As soon as you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words aloud,
24方 51:62 and say, 'Thou, O LORD, hast promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.'
24方 51:63 "And it will come about as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you will tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,
24方 51:64 and say, 'Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again, because of the calamity that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.' "Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
24方 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24方 52:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD like all that Jehoiakim had done.
24方 52:3 For through the anger of the LORD [this] came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
24方 52:4 Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it, and built a siege wall all around it.
24方 52:5 So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
24方 52:6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
24方 52:7 Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth from the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which [was] by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah.
24方 52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
24方 52:9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him.
24方 52:10 And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
24方 52:11 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.
24方 52:12 Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
24方 52:13 And he burned the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire.
24方 52:14 So all the army of the Chaldeans who [were] with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24方 52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans.
24方 52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
24方 52:17 Now the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the LORD and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon.
24方 52:18 And they also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans, and all the bronze vessels which were used in [temple] service.
24方 52:19 The captain of the guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans and the libation bowls, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.
24方 52:20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, [and] the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD-- the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
24方 52:21 As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, [and] hollow.
24方 52:22 Now a capital of bronze was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates.
24方 52:23 And there were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates [numbered] a hundred on the network all around.
24方 52:24 Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple.
24方 52:25 He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the men of war, and seven of the king's advisers who were found in the city, and the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
24方 52:26 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24方 52:27 Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
24方 52:28 These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away into exile： in the seventh year 30233 Jews;
24方 52:29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem;
24方 52:30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 46000 persons in all.
24方 52:31 Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
24方 52:32 Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who [were] with him in Babylon.
24方 52:33 So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king's presence regularly all the days of his life.
24方 52:34 And for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death.

25局 1:1 How lonely sits the city That was full of people! She has become like a widow Who was [once] great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces Has become a forced laborer!
25局 1:2 She weeps bitterly in the night, And her tears are on her cheeks; She has none to comfort her Among all her lovers. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; They have become her enemies.
25局 1:3 Judah has gone into exile under affliction, And under harsh servitude; She dwells among the nations, [But] she has found no rest; All her pursuers have overtaken her In the midst of distress.
25局 1:4 The roads of Zion are in mourning Because no one comes to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate; Her priests are groaning, Her virgins are afflicted, And she herself is bitter.
25局 1:5 Her adversaries have become her masters, Her enemies prosper; For the LORD has caused her grief Because of the multitude of her transgressions; Her little ones have gone away As captives before the adversary.
25局 1:6 And all her majesty Has departed from the daughter of Zion; Her princes have become like bucks That have found no pasture; And they have fled without strength Before the pursuer.
25局 1:7 In the days of her affliction and homelessness Jerusalem remembers all her precious things That were from the days of old When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, And no one helped her. The adversaries saw her, They mocked at her ruin.
25局 1:8 Jerusalem sinned greatly, Therefore she has become an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her Because they have seen her nakedness; Even she herself groans and turns away.
25局 1:9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts; She did not consider her future; Therefore she has fallen astonishingly; She has no comforter. "See, O LORD, my affliction, For the enemy has magnified himself!"
25局 1:10 The adversary has stretched out his hand Over all her precious things, For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, The ones whom Thou didst command That they should not enter into Thy congregation.
25局 1:11 All her people groan seeking bread; They have given their precious things for food To restore their lives themselves. "See, O LORD, and look, For I am despised."
25局 1:12 "Is it nothing to all you who pass this way? Look and see if there is any pain like my pain Which was severely dealt out to me, Which the LORD inflicted on the day of His fierce anger.
25局 1:13 "From on high He sent fire into my bones, And it prevailed [over them;] He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate, Faint all day long.
25局 1:14 "The yoke of my transgressions is bound; By His hand they are knit together; They have come upon my neck; He has made my strength fail; The Lord has given me into the hands Of [those against whom] I am not able to stand.
25局 1:15 "The Lord has rejected all my strong men In my midst; He has called an appointed time against me To crush my young men; The Lord has trodden [as in] a wine press The virgin daughter of Judah.
25局 1:16 "For these things I weep; My eyes run down with water; Because far from me is a comforter, One who restores my soul; My children are desolate Because the enemy has prevailed."
25局 1:17 Zion stretches out her hands; There is no one to comfort her; The LORD has commanded concerning Jacob That the ones round about him should be his adversaries; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
25局 1:18 "The LORD is righteous; For I have rebelled against His command; Hear now, all peoples, And behold my pain; My virgins and my young men Have gone into captivity.
25局 1:19 "I called to my lovers, [but] they deceived me; My priests and my elders perished in the city, While they sought food to restore their strength themselves.
25局 1:20 "See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death.
25局 1:21 "They have heard that I groan; There is no one to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my calamity; They are glad that Thou hast done [it.] Oh, that Thou wouldst bring the day which Thou hast proclaimed, That they may become like me.
25局 1:22 "Let all their wickedness come before Thee; And deal with them as Thou hast dealt with me For all my transgressions; For my groans are many, and my heart is faint."
25局 2:1 How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion With a cloud in His anger! He has cast from heaven to earth The glory of Israel, And has not remembered His footstool In the day of His anger.
25局 2:2 The Lord has swallowed up; He has not spared All the habitations of Jacob. In His wrath He has thrown down The strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought [them] down to the ground; He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
25局 2:3 In fierce anger He has cut off All the strength of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. And He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire Consuming round about.
25局 2:4 He has bent His bow like an enemy, He has set His right hand like an adversary And slain all that were pleasant to the eye; In the tent of the daughter of Zion He has poured out His wrath like fire.
25局 2:5 The Lord has become like an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all its palaces; He has destroyed its strongholds And multiplied in the daughter of Judah Mourning and moaning.
25局 2:6 And He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden [booth;] He has destroyed His appointed meeting place; The LORD has caused to be forgotten The appointed feast and sabbath in Zion, And He has despised king and priest In the indignation of His anger.
25局 2:7 The Lord has rejected His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As in the day of an appointed feast.
25局 2:8 The LORD determined to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line, He has not restrained His hand from destroying; And He has caused rampart and wall to lament; They have languished together.
25局 2:9 Her gates have sunk into the ground, He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The law is no more; Also, her prophets find No vision from the LORD.
25局 2:10 The elders of the daughter of Zion Sit on the ground, they are silent. They have thrown dust on their heads; They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem Have bowed their heads to the ground.
25局 2:11 My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled; My heart is poured out on the earth, Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city.
25局 2:12 They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?" As they faint like a wounded man In the streets of the city, As their life is poured out On their mothers' bosom.
25局 2:13 How shall I admonish you? To what shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I liken you as I comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea; Who can heal you?
25局 2:14 Your prophets have seen for you False and foolish [visions;] And they have not exposed your iniquity So as to restore you from captivity, But they have seen for you false and misleading oracles.
25局 2:15 All who pass along the way Clap their hands [in derision] at you; They hiss and shake their heads At the daughter of Jerusalem, "Is this the city of which they said, 'The perfection of beauty, A joy to all the earth'?"
25局 2:16 All your enemies Have opened their mouths wide against you; They hiss and gnash [their] teeth. They say, "We have swallowed [her] up! Surely this is the day for which we waited; We have reached [it,] we have seen [it.]"
25局 2:17 The LORD has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word Which He commanded from days of old. He has thrown down without sparing, And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; He has exalted the might of your adversaries.
25局 2:18 Their heart cried out to the Lord, "O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let [your] tears run down like a river day and night; Give yourself no relief; Let your eyes have no rest.
25局 2:19 "Arise, cry aloud in the night At the beginning of the night watches; Pour out your heart like water Before the presence of the Lord; Lift up your hands to Him For the life of your little ones Who are faint because of hunger At the head of every street."
25局 2:20 See, O LORD, and look! With whom hast Thou dealt thus? Should women eat their offspring, The little ones who were born healthy? Should priest and prophet be slain In the sanctuary of the Lord?
25局 2:21 On the ground in the streets Lie young and old, My virgins and my young men Have fallen by the sword. Thou hast slain [them] in the day of Thine anger, Thou hast slaughtered, not sparing.
25局 2:22 Thou didst call as in the day of an appointed feast My terrors on every side; And there was no one who escaped or survived In the day of the Lord's anger. Those whom I bore and reared, My enemy annihilated them.
25局 3:1 I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath.
25局 3:2 He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light.
25局 3:3 Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day.
25局 3:4 He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away, He has broken my bones.
25局 3:5 He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship.
25局 3:6 In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead.
25局 3:7 He has walled [me] in so that I cannot go out; He has made my chain heavy.
25局 3:8 Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer.
25局 3:9 He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked.
25局 3:10 He is to me like a bear lying in wait, [Like] a lion in secret places.
25局 3:11 He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate.
25局 3:12 He bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow.
25局 3:13 He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward parts.
25局 3:14 I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their [mocking] song all the day.
25局 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood.
25局 3:16 And He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust.
25局 3:17 And my soul has been rejected from peace; I have forgotten happiness.
25局 3:18 So I say, "My strength has perished, And [so has] my hope from the LORD ."
25局 3:19 Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.
25局 3:20 Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me.
25局 3:21 This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope.
25局 3:22 The Lord's lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail.
25局 3:23 [They] are new every morning; Great is Thy faithfulness.
25局 3:24 "The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I have hope in Him."
25局 3:25 The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him.
25局 3:26 [It is] good that he waits silently For the salvation of the LORD.
25局 3:27 [It is] good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his youth.
25局 3:28 Let him sit alone and be silent Since He has laid [it] on him.
25局 3:29 Let him put his mouth in the dust, Perhaps there is hope.
25局 3:30 Let him give his cheek to the smiter; Let him be filled with reproach.
25局 3:31 For the Lord will not reject forever,
25局 3:32 For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness.
25局 3:33 For He does not afflict willingly, Or grieve the sons of men.
25局 3:34 To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land,
25局 3:35 To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High,
25局 3:36 To defraud a man in his lawsuit-- Of these things the Lord does not approve.
25局 3:37 Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has commanded [it]?
25局 3:38 [Is it] not from the mouth of the Most High That both good and ill go forth?
25局 3:39 Why should [any] living mortal, or [any] man, Offer complaint in view of his sins?
25局 3:40 Let us examine and probe our ways, And let us return to the LORD.
25局 3:41 We lift up our heart and hands Toward God in heaven;
25局 3:42 We have transgressed and rebelled, Thou hast not pardoned.
25局 3:43 Thou hast covered [Thyself] with anger And pursued us; Thou hast slain [and] hast not spared.
25局 3:44 Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through.
25局 3:45 [Mere] offscouring and refuse Thou hast made us In the midst of the peoples.
25局 3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
25局 3:47 Panic and pitfall have befallen us, Devastation and destruction;
25局 3:48 My eyes run down with streams of water Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
25局 3:49 My eyes pour down unceasingly, Without stopping,
25局 3:50 Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven.
25局 3:51 My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city.
25局 3:52 My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird;
25局 3:53 They have silenced me in the pit And have placed a stone on me.
25局 3:54 Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!"
25局 3:55 I called on Thy name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit.
25局 3:56 Thou hast heard my voice, "Do not hide Thine ear from my [prayer for] relief, From my cry for help."
25局 3:57 Thou didst draw near when I called on Thee; Thou didst say, "Do not fear!"
25局 3:58 O Lord, Thou didst plead my soul's cause; Thou hast redeemed my life.
25局 3:59 O LORD, Thou hast seen my oppression; Judge my case.
25局 3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me.
25局 3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, All their schemes against me.
25局 3:62 The lips of my assailants and their whispering [Are] against me all day long.
25局 3:63 Look on their sitting and their rising; I am their mocking song.
25局 3:64 Thou wilt recompense them, O LORD, According to the work of their hands.
25局 3:65 Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, Thy curse will be on them.
25局 3:66 Thou wilt pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD!
25局 4:1 How dark the gold has become, How the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are poured out At the corner of every street.
25局 4:2 The precious sons of Zion, Weighed against fine gold, How they are regarded as earthen jars, The work of a potter's hands!
25局 4:3 Even jackals offer the breast, They nurse their young; [But] the daughter of my people has become cruel Like ostriches in the wilderness.
25局 4:4 The tongue of the infant cleaves To the roof of its mouth because of thirst; The little ones ask for bread, [But] no one breaks [it] for them.
25局 4:5 Those who ate delicacies Are desolate in the streets; Those reared in purple Embrace ash pits.
25局 4:6 For the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the sin of Sodom, Which was overthrown as in a moment, And no hands were turned toward her.
25局 4:7 Her consecrated ones were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy [in] body than corals, Their polishing [was] like lapis lazuli.
25局 4:8 Their appearance is blacker than soot, They are not recognized in the streets; Their skin is shriveled on their bones, It is withered, it has become like wood.
25局 4:9 Better are those slain with the sword Than those slain with hunger; For they pine away, being stricken For lack of the fruits of the field.
25局 4:10 The hands of compassionate women Boiled their own children; They became food for them Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
25局 4:11 The LORD has accomplished His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger; And He has kindled a fire in Zion Which has consumed its foundations.
25局 4:12 The kings of the earth did not believe, Nor [did] any of the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy Could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
25局 4:13 Because of the sins of her prophets [And] the iniquities of her priests, Who have shed in her midst The blood of the righteous,
25局 4:14 They wandered, blind, in the streets; They were defiled with blood So that no one could touch their garments.
25局 4:15 "Depart! Unclean!" they cried of themselves. "Depart, depart, do not touch!" So they fled and wandered; [Men] among the nations said, "They shall not continue to dwell [with us.]"
25局 4:16 The presence of the LORD has scattered them; He will not continue to regard them. They did not honor the priests, They did not favor the elders.
25局 4:17 Yet our eyes failed; [Looking] for help was useless. In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save.
25局 4:18 They hunted our steps So that we could not walk in our streets; Our end drew near, Our days were finished For our end had come.
25局 4:19 Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the sky. They chased us on the mountains; They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.
25局 4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the Lord's anointed, Was captured in their pits, Of whom we had said, "Under his shadow We shall live among the nations."
25局 4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the land of Uz; [But] the cup will come around to you as well, You will become drunk and make yourself naked.
25局 4:22 [The punishment] of your iniquity has been completed, O daughter of Zion; He will exile you no longer. [But] He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins!
25局 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; Look, and see our reproach!
25局 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, Our houses to aliens.
25局 5:3 We have become orphans without a father, Our mothers are like widows.
25局 5:4 We have to pay for our drinking water, Our wood comes [to us] at a price.
25局 5:5 Our pursuers are at our necks; We are worn out, there is no rest for us.
25局 5:6 We have submitted to Egypt [and] Assyria to get enough bread.
25局 5:7 Our fathers sinned, [and] are no more; It is we who have borne their iniquities.
25局 5:8 Slaves rule over us; There is no one to deliver us from their hand.
25局 5:9 We get our bread at the risk of our lives Because of the sword in the wilderness.
25局 5:10 Our skin has become as hot as an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.
25局 5:11 They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.
25局 5:12 Princes were hung by their hands; Elders were not respected.
25局 5:13 Young men worked at the grinding mill; And youths stumbled under [loads] of wood.
25局 5:14 Elders are gone from the gate, Young men from their music.
25局 5:15 The joy of our hearts has ceased; Our dancing has been turned into mourning.
25局 5:16 The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us, for we have sinned!
25局 5:17 Because of this our heart is faint; Because of these things our eyes are dim;
25局 5:18 Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate, Foxes prowl in it.
25局 5:19 Thou, O LORD, dost rule forever; Thy throne is from generation to generation.
25局 5:20 Why dost Thou forget us forever; Why dost Thou forsake us so long?
25局 5:21 Restore us to Thee, O LORD, that we may be restored; Renew our days as of old,
25局 5:22 Unless Thou hast utterly rejected us, [And] art exceedingly angry with us.
26
26爸 1:1 Now it came about in the thirtieth year, on the fifth [day] of the fourth month, while I was by the river Chebar among the exiles, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
26爸 1:2 (On the fifth of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile,
26爸 1:3 the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and there the hand of the LORD came upon him.)
26爸 1:4 And as I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire.
26爸 1:5 And within it there were figures resembling four living beings. And this was their appearance： they had human form.
26爸 1:6 Each of them had four faces and four wings.
26爸 1:7 And their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf's hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze.
26爸 1:8 Under their wings on their four sides [were] human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them,
26爸 1:9 their wings touched one another; their [faces] did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward.
26爸 1:10 As for the form of their faces, [each] had the face of a man, all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four had the face of an eagle.
26爸 1:11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another [being,] and two covering their bodies.
26爸 1:12 And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went.
26爸 1:13 In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire.
26爸 1:14 And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning.
26爸 1:15 Now as I looked at the living beings, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living beings, for [each of] the four of them.
26爸 1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship [was] like sparkling beryl, and all four of them had the same form, their appearance and workmanship [being] as if one wheel were within another.
26爸 1:17 Whenever they moved, they moved in any of their four directions, without turning as they moved.
26爸 1:18 As for their rims they were lofty and awesome, and the rims of all four of them were full of eyes round about.
26爸 1:19 And whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. And whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose [also.]
26爸 1:20 Wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go in that direction. And the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings [was] in the wheels.
26爸 1:21 Whenever those went, these went; and whenever those stood still, these stood still. And whenever those rose from the earth, the wheels rose close beside them; for the spirit of the living beings [was] in the wheels.
26爸 1:22 Now over the heads of the living beings [there was] something like an expanse, like the awesome gleam of crystal, extended over their heads.
26爸 1:23 And under the expanse their wings [were stretched out] straight, one toward the other; each one also had two wings covering their bodies on the one side and on the other.
26爸 1:24 I also heard the sound of their wings like the sound of abundant waters as they went, like the voice of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army camp; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.
26爸 1:25 And there came a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood still, they dropped their wings.
26爸 1:26 Now above the expanse that was over their heads there was something resembling a throne, like lapis lazuli in appearance; and on that which resembled a throne, high up, [was] a figure with the appearance of a man.
26爸 1:27 Then I noticed from the appearance of His loins and upward something like glowing metal that looked like fire all around within it, and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw something like fire; and [there was] a radiance around Him.
26爸 1:28 As the appearance of the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so [ was] the appearance of the surrounding radiance. Such [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw [it,] I fell on my face and heard a voice speaking.
26爸 2:1 Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet that I may speak with you!"
26爸 2:2 And as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard [Him] speaking to me.
26爸 2:3 Then He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the sons of Israel, to a rebellious people who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.
26爸 2:4 "And I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children; and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'
26爸 2:5 "As for them, whether they listen or not-- for they are a rebellious house-- they will know that a prophet has been among them.
26爸 2:6 "And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions; neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.
26爸 2:7 "But you shall speak My words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.
26爸 2:8 "Now you, son of man, listen to what I am speaking to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."
26爸 2:9 Then I looked, behold, a hand was extended to me; and lo, a scroll [ was] in it.
26爸 2:10 When He spread it out before me, it was written on the front and back; and written on it were lamentations, mourning and woe.
26爸 3:1 Then He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."
26爸 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll.
26爸 3:3 And He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach, and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you." Then I ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
26爸 3:4 Then He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.
26爸 3:5 "For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, [but] to the house of Israel,
26爸 3:6 nor to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. But I have sent you to them who should listen to you;
26爸 3:7 yet the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me. Surely the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate.
26爸 3:8 "Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
26爸 3:9 "Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed before them, though they are a rebellious house."
26爸 3:10 Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I shall speak to you, and listen closely.
26爸 3:11 "And go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'"
26爸 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me, "Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His place."
26爸 3:13 And I [heard] the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, even a great rumbling sound.
26爸 3:14 So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the LORD was strong on me.
26爸 3:15 Then I came to the exiles who lived beside the river Chebar at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, causing consternation among them.
26爸 3:16 Now it came about at the end of seven days that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26爸 3:17 "Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman to the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me.
26爸 3:18 "When I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die'; and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
26爸 3:19 "Yet if you have warned the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself.
26爸 3:20 "Again, when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I place an obstacle before him, he shall die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.
26爸 3:21 "However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself."
26爸 3:22 And the hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, "Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you."
26爸 3:23 So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.
26爸 3:24 The Spirit then entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself up in your house.
26爸 3:25 "As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them, so that you cannot go out among them.
26爸 3:26 "Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be dumb, and cannot be a man who rebukes them, for they are a rebellious house.
26爸 3:27 "But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
26爸 4:1 "Now you son of man, get yourself a brick, place it before you, and inscribe a city on it, Jerusalem.
26爸 4:2 "Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise up a ramp, pitch camps, and place battering rams against it all around.
26爸 4:3 "Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and set your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.
26爸 4:4 "As for you, lie down on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their iniquity for the number of days that you lie on it.
26爸 4:5 "For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their iniquity, three hundred and ninety days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
26爸 4:6 "When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, [but] on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year.
26爸 4:7 "Then you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
26爸 4:8 "Now behold, I will put ropes on you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, until you have completed the days of your siege.
26爸 4:9 "But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt, put them in one vessel and make them into bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of the days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days.
26爸 4:10 "And your food which you eat [shall be] twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall eat it from time to time.
26爸 4:11 "And the water you drink will be the sixth part of a hin by measure; you shall drink it from time to time.
26爸 4:12 "And you shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked [it] in their sight over human dung."
26爸 4:13 Then the LORD said, "Thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I shall banish them."
26爸 4:14 But I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never been defiled; for from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has any unclean meat ever entered my mouth."
26爸 4:15 Then He said to me, "See, I shall give you cow's dung in place of human dung over which you will prepare your bread."
26爸 4:16 Moreover, He said to me, "Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror,
26爸 4:17 because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and waste away in their iniquity.
26爸 5:1 "As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword; take and use it [as] a barber's razor on your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair.
26爸 5:2 "One third you shall burn in the fire at the center of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. Then you shall take one third and strike [it] with the sword all around the city, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword behind them.
26爸 5:3 "Take also a few in number from them and bind them in the edges of your [robes.]
26爸 5:4 "And take again some of them and throw them into the fire, and burn them in the fire; from it a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.
26爸 5:5 "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'This is Jerusalem; I have set her at the center of the nations, with lands around her.
26爸 5:6 'But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against My statutes more than the lands which surround her; for they have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.'
26爸 5:7 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have more turmoil than the nations which surround you, and have not walked in My statutes, nor observed My ordinances, nor observed the ordinances of the nations which surround you,'
26爸 5:8 therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
26爸 5:9 'And because of all your abominations, I will do among you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again.
26爸 5:10 'Therefore, fathers will eat [their] sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you, and scatter all your remnant to every wind.
26爸 5:11 'So as I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also withdraw, and My eye shall have no pity and I will not spare.
26爸 5:12 'One third of you will die by plague or be consumed by famine among you, one third will fall by the sword around you, and one third I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe a sword behind them.
26爸 5:13 'Thus My anger will be spent, and I will satisfy My wrath on them, and I shall be appeased; then they will know that I, the LORD, have spoken in My zeal when I have spent My wrath upon them.
26爸 5:14 'Moreover, I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations which surround you, in the sight of all who pass by.
26爸 5:15 'So it will be a reproach, a reviling, a warning and an object of horror to the nations who surround you, when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and raging rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken.
26爸 5:16 'When I send against them the deadly arrows of famine which were for the destruction of those whom I shall send to destroy you, then I shall also intensify the famine upon you, and break the staff of bread.
26爸 5:17 'Moreover, I will send on you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children; plague and bloodshed also will pass through you, and I will bring the sword on you. I, the LORD, have spoken.' "
26爸 6:1 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 6:2 "Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
26爸 6:3 and say, 'Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the ravines and the valleys： "Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.
26爸 6:4 "So your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be smashed; and I shall make your slain fall in front of your idols.
26爸 6:5 "I shall also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols; and I shall scatter your bones around your altars.
26爸 6:6 "In all your dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out.
26爸 6:7 "And the slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 6:8 "However, I shall leave a remnant, for you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the countries.
26爸 6:9 "Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they will be carried captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes, which played the harlot after their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations.
26爸 6:10 "Then they will know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them." '
26爸 6:11 "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Clap your hand, stamp your foot, and say," Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which will fall by sword, famine, and plague!
26爸 6:12 "He who is far off will die by the plague, and he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus shall I spend My wrath on them.
26爸 6:13 "Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak-- the places where they offered soothing aroma to all their idols.
26爸 6:14 "So throughout all their habitations I shall stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah; thus they will know that I am the LORD." '"
26爸 7:1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 7:2 "And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel, 'An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land.
26爸 7:3 'Now the end is upon you, and I shall send My anger against you; I shall judge you according to your ways, and I shall bring all your abominations upon you.
26爸 7:4 'For My eye will have no pity on you, nor shall I spare [you,] but I shall bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the LORD!'
26爸 7:5 "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'A disaster, unique disaster, behold it is coming!
26爸 7:6 'An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come!
26爸 7:7 'Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near-- tumult rather than joyful shouting on the mountains.
26爸 7:8 'Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you, and spend My anger against you, judge you according to your ways, and bring on you all your abominations.
26爸 7:9 'And My eye will show no pity, nor will I spare. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst; then you will know that I, the LORD, do the smiting.
26爸 7:10 'Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! [Your] doom has gone forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed.
26爸 7:11 'Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them [shall remain], none of their multitude, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them.
26爸 7:12 'The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn; for wrath is against all their multitude.
26爸 7:13 'Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they [both] live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his iniquity.
26爸 7:14 'They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle; for My wrath is against all their multitude.
26爸 7:15 'The sword is outside, and the plague and the famine are within. He who is in the field will die by the sword; famine and the plague will also consume those in the city.
26爸 7:16 'Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each over his own iniquity.
26爸 7:17 'All hands will hang limp, and all knees will become like water.
26爸 7:18 'And they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and shuddering will overwhelm them; and shame [will be] on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.
26爸 7:19 'They shall fling their silver into the streets, and their gold shall become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetite, nor can they fill their stomachs, for their iniquity has become an occasion of stumbling.
26爸 7:20 'And they transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride, and they made the images of their abominations [and] their detestable things with it; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them.
26爸 7:21 'And I shall give it into the hands of the foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it.
26爸 7:22 'I shall also turn My face from them, and they will profane My secret place; then robbers will enter and profane it.
26爸 7:23 'Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
26爸 7:24 'Therefore, I shall bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I shall also make the pride of the strong ones cease, and their holy places will be profaned.
26爸 7:25 'When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.
26爸 7:26 'Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will be [added] to rumor; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders.
26爸 7:27 'The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their conduct I shall deal with them, and by their judgments I shall judge them. And they will know that I am the LORD.' "
26爸 8:1 And it came about in the sixth year, on the fifth [day] of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell on me there.
26爸 8:2 Then I looked, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of a man; from His loins and downward [there was] the appearance of fire, and from His loins and upward the appearance of brightness, like the appearance of glowing metal.
26爸 8:3 And He stretched out the form of a hand and caught me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner [court,] where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was [located.]
26爸 8:4 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel [was] there, like the appearance which I saw in the plain.
26爸 8:5 Then He said to me, "Son of man, raise your eyes, now, toward the north." So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate [was] this idol of jealousy at the entrance.
26爸 8:6 And He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, that I should be far from My sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations."
26爸 8:7 Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
26爸 8:8 And He said to me, "Son of man, now dig through the wall." So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance.
26爸 8:9 And He said to me, "Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here."
26爸 8:10 So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts [and] detestable things, with all the idols of the house of Israel, were carved on the wall all around.
26爸 8:11 And standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand, and the fragrance of the cloud of incense rising.
26爸 8:12 Then He said to me, "Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark, each man in the room of his carved images? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.'"
26爸 8:13 And He said to me, "Yet you will see still greater abominations which they are committing."
26爸 8:14 Then He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord's house which [was] toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
26爸 8:15 And He said to me, "Do you see [this,] son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these."
26爸 8:16 Then He brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house. And behold, at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, [were] about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun.
26爸 8:17 And He said to me, "Do you see [this,] son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me repeatedly? For behold, they are putting the twig to their nose.
26爸 8:18 "Therefore, I indeed shall deal in wrath. My eye will have no pity nor shall I spare; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, yet I shall not listen to them."
26爸 9:1 Then He cried out in my hearing with a loud voice saying, "Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."
26爸 9:2 And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand; and among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case at his loins. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
26爸 9:3 Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case.
26爸 9:4 And the LORD said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, [even] through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations which are being committed in its midst."
26爸 9:5 But to the others He said in my hearing, "Go through the city after him and strike; do not let your eye have pity, and do not spare.
26爸 9:6 "Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women, but do not touch any man on whom is the mark; and you shall start from My sanctuary." So they started with the elders who [were] before the temple.
26爸 9:7 And He said to them, "Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!" Thus they went out and struck down [the people] in the city.
26爸 9:8 Then it came about as they were striking and I [alone] was left, that I fell on my face and cried out saying, "Alas, Lord GOD! Art Thou destroying the whole remnant of Israel by pouring out Thy wrath on Jerusalem?"
26爸 9:9 Then He said to me, "The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversion; for they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!'
26爸 9:10 "But as for Me, My eye will have no pity nor shall I spare, but I shall bring their conduct upon their heads."
26爸 9:11 Then behold, the man clothed in linen at whose loins was the writing case reported, saying, "I have done just as Thou hast commanded me."
26爸 10:1 Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them.
26爸 10:2 And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, "Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim, and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter [them] over the city." And he entered in my sight.
26爸 10:3 Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court.
26爸 10:4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
26爸 10:5 Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
26爸 10:6 And it came about when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he entered and stood beside a wheel.
26爸 10:7 Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which [was] between the cherubim, took some and put it into the hands of the one clothed in linen, who took [it] and went out.
26爸 10:8 And the cherubim appeared to have the form of a man's hand under their wings.
26爸 10:9 Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels [was] like the gleam of a Tarshish stone.
26爸 10:10 And as for their appearance, all four of them had the same likeness, as if one wheel were within another wheel.
26爸 10:11 When they moved, they went in [any of] their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed in the direction which they faced, without turning as they went.
26爸 10:12 And their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them.
26爸 10:13 The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.
26爸 10:14 And each one had four faces. The first face [was] the face of a cherub, the second face [was] the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
26爸 10:15 Then the cherubim rose up. They are the living beings that I saw by the river Chebar.
26爸 10:16 Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also when the cherubim lifted up their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels would not turn from beside them.
26爸 10:17 When the cherubim stood still, the wheels would stand still; and when they rose up, the wheels would rise with them; for the spirit of the living beings [was] in them.
26爸 10:18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
26爸 10:19 When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord's house. And the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.
26爸 10:20 These are the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; so I knew that they [were] cherubim.
26爸 10:21 Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and beneath their wings [was] the form of human hands.
26爸 10:22 As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. Each one went straight ahead.
26爸 11:1 Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Lord's house which faced eastward. And behold, [there were] twenty-five men at the entrance of the gate, and among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.
26爸 11:2 And He said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give evil advice in this city,
26爸 11:3 who say, 'Is not [the time] near to build houses? This [city] is the pot and we are the flesh.'
26爸 11:4 "Therefore, prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy!"
26爸 11:5 Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to me, "Say, 'Thus says the LORD," So you think, house of Israel, for I know your thoughts.
26爸 11:6 "You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with them."
26爸 11:7 'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of the city are the flesh, and this [city] is the pot; but I shall bring you out of it.
26爸 11:8 "You have feared a sword; so I will bring a sword upon you," the Lord GOD declares.
26爸 11:9 "And I shall bring you out of the midst of the city, and I shall deliver you into the hands of strangers and execute judgments against you.
26爸 11:10 "You will fall by the sword. I shall judge you to the border of Israel; so you shall know that I am the LORD.
26爸 11:11 "This [city] will not be a pot for you, nor will you be flesh in the midst of it, [but] I shall judge you to the border of Israel.
26爸 11:12 "Thus you will know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor have you executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you." '"
26爸 11:13 Now it came about as I prophesied, that Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, "Alas, Lord GOD! Wilt Thou bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?"
26爸 11:14 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26爸 11:15 "Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel, all of them, [are those] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; this land has been given us as a possession.'
26爸 11:16 "Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Though I had removed them far away among the nations, and though I had scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary for them a little while in the countries where they had gone. "'
26爸 11:17 "Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," I shall gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries among which you have been scattered, and I shall give you the land of Israel. "'
26爸 11:18 "When they come there, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations from it.
26爸 11:19 "And I shall give them one heart, and shall put a new spirit within them. And I shall take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,
26爸 11:20 that they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them. Then they will be My people, and I shall be their God.
26爸 11:21 "But as for those whose hearts go after their detestable things and abominations, I shall bring their conduct down on their heads," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 11:22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.
26爸 11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mountain which is east of the city.
26爸 11:24 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God to the exiles in Chaldea. So the vision that I had seen left me.
26爸 11:25 Then I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
26爸 12:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 12:2 "Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.
26爸 12:3 "Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house.
26爸 12:4 "And bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you will go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile.
26爸 12:5 "Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it.
26爸 12:6 "Load [the baggage] on [your] shoulder in their sight, [and] carry [ it] out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you can not see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel."
26爸 12:7 And I did so, as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark [and] carried [the baggage] on [my] shoulder in their sight.
26爸 12:8 And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
26爸 12:9 "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?'
26爸 12:10 "Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," This burden [concerns] the prince in Jerusalem, as well as all the house of Israel who are in it. "'
26爸 12:11 "Say, 'I am a sign to you. As I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.'
26爸 12:12 "And the prince who is among them will load [his baggage] on [his] shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring [it] out. He will cover his face so that he can not see the land with [his] eyes.
26爸 12:13 "I shall also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And I shall bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.
26爸 12:14 "And I shall scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I shall draw out a sword after them.
26爸 12:15 "So they will know that I am the LORD when I scatter them among the nations, and spread them among the countries.
26爸 12:16 "But I shall spare a few of them from the sword, the famine, and the pestilence that they may tell all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD."
26爸 12:17 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 12:18 "Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.
26爸 12:19 "Then say to the people of the land, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel," They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fulness on account of the violence of all who live in it.
26爸 12:20 "And the inhabited cities will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the LORD." '"
26爸 12:21 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 12:22 "Son of man, what is this proverb you [people] have concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The days are long and every vision fails'?
26爸 12:23 "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," I will make this proverb cease so that they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel. "But tell them," The days draw near as well as the fulfillment of every vision.
26爸 12:24 "For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
26爸 12:25 "For I the LORD shall speak, and whatever word I speak will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, O rebellious house, I shall speak the word and perform it," declares the Lord GOD. '"
26爸 12:26 Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 12:27 "Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, 'The vision that he sees is for many years [from now,] and he prophesies of times far off.'
26爸 12:28 "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed, "' "declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 13:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 13:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration, 'Listen to the word of the LORD!
26爸 13:3 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing.
26爸 13:4 "O Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins.
26爸 13:5 "You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the LORD.
26爸 13:6 "They see falsehood and lying divination who are saying, 'The LORD declares,' when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of [their] word.
26爸 13:7 "Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, 'The LORD declares,' but it is not I who have spoken?" '"
26爸 13:8 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have spoken falsehood and seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 13:9 "So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord GOD.
26爸 13:10 "It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, 'Peace!' when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash;
26爸 13:11 [so] tell those who plaster it over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a violent wind will break out.
26爸 13:12 "Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, 'Where is the plaster with which you plastered [it]?'"
26爸 13:13 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My anger a flooding rain and hailstones to consume [it] in wrath.
26爸 13:14 "So I shall tear down the wall which you plastered over with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is laid bare; and when it falls, you will be consumed in its midst. And you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 13:15 "Thus I shall spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with whitewash; and I shall say to you, 'The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,
26爸 13:16 [along with] the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, 'declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 13:17 "Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own inspiration. Prophesy against them,
26爸 13:18 and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the women who sew [magic] bands on all wrists, and make veils for the heads of [persons] of every stature to hunt down lives! Will you hunt down the lives of My people, but preserve the lives [of others] for yourselves?
26爸 13:19 "And for handfuls of barley and fragments of bread, you have profaned Me to My people to put to death some who should not die and to keep others alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies." '"
26爸 13:20 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against your [ magic] bands by which you hunt lives there as birds, and I will tear them off your arms; and I will let them go, even those lives whom you hunt as birds.
26爸 13:21 "I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, and they will no longer be in your hands to be hunted; and you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 13:22 "Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, but have encouraged the wicked not to turn from his wicked way [and] preserve his life,
26爸 13:23 therefore, you women will no longer see false visions or practice divination, and I will deliver My people out of your hand. Thus you will know that I am the LORD. "
26爸 14:1 Then some elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me.
26爸 14:2 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 14:3 "Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and have put right before their faces the stumbling block of their iniquity. Should I be consulted by them at all?
26爸 14:4 "Therefore speak to them and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Any man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and [then] comes to the prophet, I the LORD will be brought to give him an answer in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols,
26爸 14:5 in order to lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who are estranged from Me through all their idols. "'
26爸 14:6 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.
26爸 14:7 "For anyone of the house of Israel or of the immigrants who stay in Israel who separates himself from Me, sets up his idols in his heart, puts right before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and [then] comes to the prophet to inquire of Me for himself, I the LORD will be brought to answer him in My own person.
26爸 14:8 "And I shall set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I shall cut him off from among My people. So you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 14:9 "But if the prophet is prevailed upon to speak a word, it is I, the LORD, who have prevailed upon that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
26爸 14:10 "And they will bear [the punishment of] their iniquity; as the iniquity of the inquirer is, so the iniquity of the prophet will be,
26爸 14:11 in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Thus they will be My people, and I shall be their God, "'declares the Lord GOD."
26爸 14:12 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 14:13 "Son of man, if a country sins against Me by committing unfaithfulness, and I stretch out My hand against it, destroy its supply of bread, send famine against it, and cut off from it both man and beast,
26爸 14:14 even [though] these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst, by their [own] righteousness they could [only] deliver themselves, "declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 14:15 "If I were to cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they depopulated it, and it became desolate so that no one would pass through it because of the beasts,
26爸 14:16 [though] these three men were in its midst, as I live, "declares the Lord GOD," they could not deliver either [their] sons or [their] daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the country would be desolate.
26爸 14:17 "Or [if] I should bring a sword on that country and say, 'Let the sword pass through the country and cut off man and beast from it,'
26爸 14:18 even [though] these three men were in its midst, as I live, "declares the Lord GOD," they could not deliver either [their] sons or [their] daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
26爸 14:19 "Or [if] I should send a plague against that country and pour out My wrath in blood on it, to cut off man and beast from it,
26爸 14:20 even [though] Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst, as I live, " declares the Lord GOD, "they could not deliver either [their] son or [their] daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness."
26爸 14:21 For thus says the Lord GOD, "How much more when I send My four severe judgments against Jerusalem： sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague to cut off man and beast from it!
26爸 14:22 "Yet, behold, survivors will be left in it who will be brought out, [both] sons and daughters. Behold, they are going to come forth to you and you will see their conduct and actions; then you will be comforted for the calamity which I have brought against Jerusalem for everything which I have brought upon it.
26爸 14:23 "Then they will comfort you when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have not done in vain whatever I did to it," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 15:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 15:2 "Son of man, how is the wood of the vine [better] than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
26爸 15:3 "Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can [men] take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?
26爸 15:4 "If it has been put into the fire for fuel, [and] the fire has consumed both of its ends, and its middle part has been charred, is it [then] useful for anything?
26爸 15:5 "Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything!
26爸 15:6 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
26爸 15:7 and I set My face against them. [Though] they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them.
26爸 15:8 'Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,' "declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 16:2 "Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
26爸 16:3 and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem, "Your origin and your birth are from the land of the Canaanite, your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
26爸 16:4 "As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing; you were not rubbed with salt or even wrapped in cloths.
26爸 16:5 "No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.
26爸 16:6 "When I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you [while you were] in your blood, 'Live!' I said to you while you were in your blood, 'Live!'
26爸 16:7 "I made you numerous like plants of the field. Then you grew up, became tall, and reached the age for fine ornaments; [your] breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Yet you were naked and bare.
26爸 16:8 "Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 16:9 "Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you, and anointed you with oil.
26爸 16:10 "I also clothed you with embroidered cloth, and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
26爸 16:11 "And I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and a necklace around your neck.
26爸 16:12 "I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
26爸 16:13 "Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
26爸 16:14 "Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 16:15 "But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be [willing.]
26爸 16:16 "And you took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors, and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen.
26爸 16:17 "You also took your beautiful jewels [made] of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images that you might play the harlot with them.
26爸 16:18 "Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them.
26爸 16:19 "Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 16:20 "Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me, and you sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter?
26爸 16:21 "You slaughtered My children, and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through [the fire.]
26爸 16:22 "And besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood.
26爸 16:23 "Then it came about after all your wickedness ('Woe, woe to you!' declares the Lord GOD),
26爸 16:24 that you built yourself a shrine and made yourself a high place in every square.
26爸 16:25 "You built yourself a high place at the top of every street, and made your beauty abominable; and you spread your legs to every passer-by to multiply your harlotry.
26爸 16:26 "You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and multiplied your harlotry to make Me angry.
26爸 16:27 "Behold now, I have stretched out My hand against you and diminished your rations. And I delivered you up to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd conduct.
26爸 16:28 "Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians because you were not satisfied; you even played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied.
26爸 16:29 "You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied." '"
26爸 16:30 "How languishing is your heart," declares the Lord GOD, "while you do all these things, the actions of a bold-faced harlot.
26爸 16:31 "When you built your shrine at the beginning of every street and made your high place in every square, in disdaining money, you were not like a harlot.
26爸 16:32 "You adulteress wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!
26爸 16:33 "Men give gifts to all harlots, but you give your gifts to all your lovers to bribe them to come to you from every direction for your harlotries.
26爸 16:34 "Thus you are different from those women in your harlotries, in that no one plays the harlot as you do, because you give money and no money is given you; thus you are different."
26爸 16:35 Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD.
26爸 16:36 Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because your lewdness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered through your harlotries with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your sons which you gave to idols,
26爸 16:37 therefore, behold, I shall gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, even all those whom you loved [and] all those whom you hated. So I shall gather them against you from every direction and expose your nakedness to them that they may see all your nakedness.
26爸 16:38 "Thus I shall judge you, like women who commit adultery or shed blood are judged; and I shall bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
26爸 16:39 "I shall also give you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your shrines, demolish your high places, strip you of your clothing, take away your jewels, and will leave you naked and bare.
26爸 16:40 "They will incite a crowd against you, and they will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
26爸 16:41 "And they will burn your houses with fire and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. Then I shall stop you from playing the harlot, and you will also no longer pay your lovers.
26爸 16:42 "So I shall calm My fury against you, and My jealousy will depart from you, and I shall be pacified and angry no more.
26爸 16:43 "Because you have not remembered the days of your youth but have enraged Me by all these things, behold, I in turn will bring your conduct down on your own head," declares the Lord GOD, "so that you will not commit this lewdness on top of all your [other] abominations.
26爸 16:44 "Behold, everyone who quotes proverbs will quote [this] proverb concerning you, saying, 'Like mother, like daughter.'
26爸 16:45 "You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You are also the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26爸 16:46 "Now your older sister is Samaria, who lives north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lives south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
26爸 16:47 "Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.
26爸 16:48 "As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "Sodom, your sister, and her daughters, have not done as you and your daughters have done.
26爸 16:49 "Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom： she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.
26爸 16:50 "Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw [it.]
26爸 16:51 "Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half of your sins, for you have multiplied your abominations more than they. Thus you have made your sisters appear righteous by all your abominations which you have committed.
26爸 16:52 "Also bear your disgrace in that you have made judgment favorable for your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. Yes, be also ashamed and bear your disgrace, in that you made your sisters appear righteous.
26爸 16:53 "Nevertheless, I will restore their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and along with them your own captivity,
26爸 16:54 in order that you may bear your humiliation, and feel ashamed for all that you have done when you become a consolation to them.
26爸 16:55 "And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state, and you with your daughters will [also] return to your former state.
26爸 16:56 "As [the name of] your sister Sodom was not heard from your lips in your day of pride,
26爸 16:57 before your wickedness was uncovered, so now you have become the reproach of the daughters of Edom, and of all who are around her, of the daughters of the Philistines-- those surrounding [you] who despise you.
26爸 16:58 "You have borne [the penalty of] your lewdness and abominations," the LORD declares.
26爸 16:59 For thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
26爸 16:60 "Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
26爸 16:61 "Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, [both] your older and your younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.
26爸 16:62 "Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,
26爸 16:63 in order that you may remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done, "the Lord GOD declares.
26爸 17:1 Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 17:2 "Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
26爸 17:3 saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "A great eagle with great wings, long pinions and a full plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar.
26爸 17:4 "He plucked off the topmost of its young twigs and brought it to a land of merchants; he set it in a city of traders.
26爸 17:5 "He also took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed [it] beside abundant waters; he set it [like] a willow.
26爸 17:6 "Then it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine with its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine, and yielded shoots and sent out branches.
26爸 17:7 "But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and sent out its branches toward him from the beds where it was planted, that he might water it.
26爸 17:8 "It was planted in good soil beside abundant waters, that it might yield branches and bear fruit, [and] become a splendid vine." '
26爸 17:9 "Say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers-- so that all its sprouting leaves wither? And neither by great strength nor by many people can it be raised from its roots [again.]
26爸 17:10 "Behold, though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither as soon as the east wind strikes it-- wither on the beds where it grew?" '"
26爸 17:11 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 17:12 "Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things [mean?'] Say, 'Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and princes, and brought them to him in Babylon.
26爸 17:13 'And he took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,
26爸 17:14 that the kingdom might be in subjection, not exalting itself, [but] keeping his covenant, that it might continue.
26爸 17:15 'But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt that they might give him horses and many troops. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Can he indeed break the covenant and escape?
26爸 17:16 'As I live,' declares the Lord GOD, 'Surely in the country of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
26爸 17:17 'And Pharaoh with [his] mighty army and great company will not help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build siege walls to cut off many lives.
26爸 17:18 'Now he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and behold, he pledged his allegiance, yet did all these things; he shall not escape.' "
26爸 17:19 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "As I live, surely My oath which he despised and My covenant which he broke, I will inflict on his head.
26爸 17:20 "And I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. Then I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there [regarding] the unfaithful act which he has committed against Me.
26爸 17:21 "And all the choice men in all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind; and you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken."
26爸 17:22 Thus says the Lord GOD, "I shall also take [a sprig] from the lofty top of the cedar and set [it] out; I shall pluck from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I shall plant [it] on a high and lofty mountain.
26爸 17:23 "On the high mountain of Israel I shall plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit, and become a stately cedar. And birds of every kind will nest under it; they will nest in the shade of its branches.
26爸 17:24 "And all the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD; I bring down the high tree, exalt the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will perform [it.]"
26爸 18:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 18:2 "What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying, 'The fathers eat the sour grapes, But the children's teeth are set on edge'?
26爸 18:3 "As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "you are surely not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore.
26爸 18:4 "Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.
26爸 18:5 "But if a man is righteous, and practices justice and righteousness,
26爸 18:6 and does not eat at the mountain [shrines] or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife, or approach a woman during her menstrual period--
26爸 18:7 if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, [but] gives his bread to the hungry, and covers the naked with clothing,
26爸 18:8 if he does not lend [money] on interest or take increase, [if] he keeps his hand from iniquity, [and] executes true justice between man and man,
26爸 18:9 [if] he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully-- he is righteous [and] will surely live, "declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 18:10 "Then he may have a violent son who sheds blood, and who does any of these things to a brother
26爸 18:11 (though he himself did not do any of these things), that is, he even eats at the mountain [shrines,] and defiles his neighbor's wife,
26爸 18:12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, but lifts up his eyes to the idols, [and] commits abomination,
26爸 18:13 he lends [money] on interest and takes increase; will he live? He will not live! He has committed all these abominations, he will surely be put to death; his blood will be on his own head.
26爸 18:14 "Now behold, he has a son who has observed all his father's sins which he committed, and observing does not do likewise.
26爸 18:15 "He does not eat at the mountain [shrines] or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife,
26爸 18:16 or oppress anyone, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery, [but] he gives his bread to the hungry, and covers the naked with clothing,
26爸 18:17 he keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, [but] executes My ordinances, and walks in My statutes; he will not die for his father's iniquity, he will surely live.
26爸 18:18 "As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed [his] brother, and did what was not good among his people, behold, he will die for his iniquity.
26爸 18:19 "Yet you say, 'Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity?' When the son has practiced justice and righteousness, and has observed all My statutes and done them, he shall surely live.
26爸 18:20 "The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.
26爸 18:21 "But if the wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
26爸 18:22 "All his transgressions which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live.
26爸 18:23 "Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked," declares the Lord GOD, "rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?
26爸 18:24 "But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for them he will die.
26爸 18:25 "Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Hear now, O house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?
26爸 18:26 "When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies because of it, for his iniquity which he has committed he will die.
26爸 18:27 "Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life.
26爸 18:28 "Because he considered and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
26爸 18:29 "But the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' Are My ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right?
26爸 18:30 "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct," declares the Lord GOD. "Repent and turn away from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you.
26爸 18:31 "Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel?
26爸 18:32 "For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares the Lord GOD. "Therefore, repent and live."
26爸 19:1 "As for you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
26爸 19:2 and say, 'What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, She reared her cubs.
26爸 19:3 'When she brought up one of her cubs, He became a lion, And he learned to tear [his] prey; He devoured men.
26爸 19:4 'Then nations heard about him; He was captured in their pit, And they brought him with hooks To the land of Egypt.
26爸 19:5 'When she saw, as she waited, [That] her hope was lost, She took another of her cubs And made him a young lion.
26爸 19:6 'And he walked about among the lions; He became a young lion, He learned to tear [his] prey; He devoured men.
26爸 19:7 'And he destroyed their fortified towers And laid waste their cities; And the land and its fulness were appalled Because of the sound of his roaring.
26爸 19:8 'Then nations set against him On every side from [their] provinces, And they spread their net over him; He was captured in their pit.
26爸 19:9 'And they put him in a cage with hooks And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in hunting nets So that his voice should be heard no more On the mountains of Israel.
26爸 19:10 'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, Planted by the waters; It was fruitful and full of branches Because of abundant waters.
26爸 19:11 'And it had strong branches [fit] for scepters of rulers, And its height was raised above the clouds So that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
26爸 19:12 'But it was plucked up in fury; It was cast down to the ground; And the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off So that it withered; The fire consumed it.
26爸 19:13 'And now it is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land.
26爸 19:14 'And fire has gone out from [its] branch; It has consumed its shoots [and] fruit, So that there is not in it a strong branch, A scepter to rule.' "This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
26爸 20:1 Now it came about in the seventh year, in the fifth [month,] on the tenth of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
26爸 20:2 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 20:3 "Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Do you come to inquire of Me? As I live, "declares the Lord GOD," I will not be inquired of by you. "'
26爸 20:4 "Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers;
26爸 20:5 and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God,
26爸 20:6 on that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
26爸 20:7 "And I said to them, 'Cast away, each of you, the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.'
26爸 20:8 "But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
26爸 20:9 "But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they [lived,] in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
26爸 20:10 "So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
26爸 20:11 "And I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live.
26爸 20:12 "And also I gave them My sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
26爸 20:13 "But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes, and they rejected My ordinances, by which, if a man observes them, he will live; and My sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them.
26爸 20:14 "But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose sight I had brought them out.
26爸 20:15 "And also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,
26爸 20:16 because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they even profaned My sabbaths, for their heart continually went after their idols.
26爸 20:17 "Yet My eye spared them rather than destroying them, and I did not cause their annihilation in the wilderness.
26爸 20:18 "And I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, or keep their ordinances, or defile yourselves with their idols.
26爸 20:19 'I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My ordinances, and observe them.
26爸 20:20 'And sanctify My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.'
26爸 20:21 "But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to observe My ordinances, by which, [if] a man observes them, he will live; they profaned My sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to accomplish My anger against them in the wilderness.
26爸 20:22 "But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
26爸 20:23 "Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands,
26爸 20:24 because they had not observed My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes, and had profaned My sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers.
26爸 20:25 "And I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live;
26爸 20:26 and I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they caused all their first-born to pass through [the fire] so that I might make them desolate, in order that they might know that I am the LORD. "'
26爸 20:27 "Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by acting treacherously against Me.
26爸 20:28 "When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There also they made their soothing aroma, and there they poured out their libations.
26爸 20:29 "Then I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you go?' So its name is called Bamah to this day." '
26爸 20:30 "Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and play the harlot after their detestable things?
26爸 20:31 "And when you offer your gifts, when you cause your sons to pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "I will not be inquired of by you.
26爸 20:32 "And what comes into your mind will not come about, when you say： ' We will be like the nations, like the tribes of the lands, serving wood and stone. '
26爸 20:33 "As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I shall be king over you.
26爸 20:34 "And I shall bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out;
26爸 20:35 and I shall bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I shall enter into judgment with you face to face.
26爸 20:36 "As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 20:37 "And I shall make you pass under the rod, and I shall bring you into the bond of the covenant;
26爸 20:38 and I shall purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I shall bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 20:39 "As for you, O house of Israel," thus says the Lord GOD, "Go, serve everyone his idols; but later, you will surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will profane no longer with your gifts and with your idols.
26爸 20:40 "For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel," declares the Lord GOD, "there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land; there I shall accept them, and there I shall seek your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things.
26爸 20:41 "As a soothing aroma I shall accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I shall prove Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.
26爸 20:42 "And you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers.
26爸 20:43 "And there you will remember your ways and all your deeds, with which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done.
26爸 20:44 "Then you will know that I am the LORD when I have dealt with you for My name's sake, not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD. '"
26爸 20:45 Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 20:46 "Son of man, set your face toward Teman, and speak out against the south, and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev,
26爸 20:47 and say to the forest of the Negev, 'Hear the word of the LORD： thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am about to kindle a fire in you, and it shall consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be quenched, and the whole surface from south to north will be burned by it.
26爸 20:48 "And all flesh will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched." '"
26爸 20:49 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not [just] speaking parables?'"
26爸 21:1 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 21:2 "Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
26爸 21:3 and say to the land of Israel, 'Thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am against you; and I shall draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
26爸 21:4 "Because I shall cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword shall go forth from its sheath against all flesh from south [to] north.
26爸 21:5 "Thus all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword out of its sheath. It will not return [to its sheath] again." '
26爸 21:6 "As for you, son of man, groan with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan in their sight.
26爸 21:7 "And it will come about when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' that you will say, 'Because of the news that is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will happen,' declares the Lord GOD."
26爸 21:8 Again the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 21:9 "Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the LORD.' Say, 'A sword, a sword sharpened And also polished!
26爸 21:10 'Sharpened to make a slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning!' Or shall we rejoice, the rod of My son despising every tree?
26爸 21:11 "And it is given to be polished, that it may be handled; the sword is sharpened and polished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
26爸 21:12 "Cry out and wail, son of man; for it is against My people, it is against all the officials of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with My people, therefore strike [your] thigh.
26爸 21:13 "For [there is] a testing; and what if even the rod which despises will be no more?" declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 21:14 "You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and clap [your] hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword for the slain. It is the sword for the great one slain, which surrounds them,
26爸 21:15 that [their] hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword. Ah! It is made [for striking] like lightning, it is wrapped up [in readiness] for slaughter.
26爸 21:16 "Show yourself sharp, go to the right; set yourself; go to the left, wherever your edge is appointed.
26爸 21:17 "I shall also clap My hands together, and I shall appease My wrath; I, the LORD, have spoken."
26爸 21:18 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 21:19 "As for you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them will go out of one land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to the city.
26爸 21:20 "You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
26爸 21:21 "For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.
26爸 21:22 "Into his right hand came the divination, 'Jerusalem,' to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to lift up the voice with a battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build a siege wall.
26爸 21:23 "And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have [sworn] solemn oaths. But he brings iniquity to remembrance, that they may be seized.
26爸 21:24 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear-- because you have come to remembrance, you will be seized with the hand.
26爸 21:25 'And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end,'
26爸 21:26 thus says the Lord GOD, 'Remove the turban, and take off the crown; this will [be] no more the same. Exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
26爸 21:27 'A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, I shall make it. This also will be no more, until He comes whose right it is; and I shall give it [to Him.]'
26爸 21:28 "And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach,' and say： ' A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for the slaughter, to cause it to consume, that it may be like lightning--
26爸 21:29 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you-- to place you on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end.
26爸 21:30 'Return [it] to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I shall judge you.
26爸 21:31 'And I shall pour out My indignation on you; I shall blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and I shall give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled in destruction.
26爸 21:32 'You will be fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.' "
26爸 22:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 22:2 "And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.
26爸 22:3 "And you shall say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," A city shedding blood in her midst, so that her time will come, and that makes idols, contrary to her [interest,] for defilement!
26爸 22:4 "You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made. Thus you have brought your day near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the lands.
26爸 22:5 "Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you of ill repute, full of turmoil.
26爸 22:6 "Behold, the rulers of Israel, each according to his power, have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood.
26爸 22:7 "They have treated father and mother lightly within you. The alien they have oppressed in your midst; the fatherless and the widow they have wronged in you.
26爸 22:8 "You have despised My holy things and profaned My sabbaths.
26爸 22:9 "Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain [shrines.] In your midst they have committed acts of lewdness.
26爸 22:10 "In you they have uncovered [their] fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her menstrual impurity.
26爸 22:11 "And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife, and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
26爸 22:12 "In you they have taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and profits, and you have injured your neighbors for gain by oppression, and you have forgotten Me," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 22:13 "Behold, then, I smite My hand at your dishonest gain which you have acquired and at the bloodshed which is among you.
26爸 22:14 "Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken and shall act.
26爸 22:15 "And I shall scatter you among the nations, and I shall disperse you through the lands, and I shall consume your uncleanness from you.
26爸 22:16 "And you will profane yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the LORD." '"
26爸 22:17 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 22:18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
26爸 22:19 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because all of you have become dross, therefore, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
26爸 22:20 'As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt [it,] so I shall gather [you] in My anger and in My wrath, and I shall lay you [there] and melt you.
26爸 22:21 'And I shall gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.
26爸 22:22 'As silver is melted in the furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath on you.' "
26爸 22:23 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 22:24 "Son of man, say to her, 'You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.'
26爸 22:25 "There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her.
26爸 22:26 "Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
26爸 22:27 "Her princes within her are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood [and] destroying lives in order to get dishonest gain.
26爸 22:28 "And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken.
26爸 22:29 "The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the sojourner without justice.
26爸 22:30 "And I searched for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.
26爸 22:31 "Thus I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way I have brought upon their heads," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 23:1 The word of the LORD came to me again saying,
26爸 23:2 "Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
26爸 23:3 and they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed, and there their virgin bosom was handled.
26爸 23:4 "And their names were Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And [as for] their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.
26爸 23:5 "And Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, [her] neighbors,
26爸 23:6 who were clothed in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
26爸 23:7 "And she bestowed her harlotries on them, all of whom [were] the choicest men of Assyria; and with all whom she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself.
26爸 23:8 "And she did not forsake her harlotries from [the time in] Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her, and they handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her.
26爸 23:9 "Therefore, I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
26爸 23:10 "They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, but they slew her with the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgments on her.
26爸 23:11 "Now her sister Oholibah saw [this,] yet she was more corrupt in her lust than she, and her harlotries were more than the harlotries of her sister.
26爸 23:12 "She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and officials, the ones near, magnificently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
26爸 23:13 "And I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way.
26爸 23:14 "So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
26爸 23:15 girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians [in] Chaldea, the land of their birth.
26爸 23:16 "And when she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
26爸 23:17 "And the Babylonians came to her to the bed of love, and they defiled her with their harlotry. And when she had been defiled by them, she became disgusted with them.
26爸 23:18 "And she uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness; then I became disgusted with her, as I had become disgusted with her sister.
26爸 23:19 "Yet she multiplied her harlotries, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
26爸 23:20 "And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is [like] the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is [like] the issue of horses.
26爸 23:21 "Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom because of the breasts of your youth.
26爸 23:22 "Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold I will arouse your lovers against you, from whom you were alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side：
26爸 23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and officials all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
26爸 23:24 'And they will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet; and I shall commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs.
26爸 23:25 'And I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire.
26爸 23:26 'They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
26爸 23:27 'Thus I shall make your lewdness and your harlotry [brought] from the land of Egypt to cease from you, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.'
26爸 23:28 "For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will give you into the hand of those whom you hate, into the hand of those from whom you were alienated.
26爸 23:29 'And they will deal with you in hatred, take all your property, and leave you naked and bare. And the nakedness of your harlotries shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotries.
26爸 23:30 'These things will be done to you because you have played the harlot with the nations, because you have defiled yourself with their idols.
26爸 23:31 'You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.'
26爸 23:32 "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'You will drink your sister's cup, Which is deep and wide. You will be laughed at and held in derision; It contains much.
26爸 23:33 'You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria.
26爸 23:34 'And you will drink it and drain it. Then you will gnaw its fragments And tear your breasts; for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 23:35 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, bear now the [punishment] of your lewdness and your harlotries.'"
26爸 23:36 Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
26爸 23:37 "For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. Thus they have committed adultery with their idols and even caused their sons, whom they bore to Me, to pass through [the fire] to them as food.
26爸 23:38 "Again, they have done this to Me： they have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and have profaned My sabbaths.
26爸 23:39 "For when they had slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary on the same day to profane it; and lo, thus they did within My house.
26爸 23:40 "Furthermore, they have even sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came-- for whom you bathed, painted your eyes, and decorated yourselves with ornaments;
26爸 23:41 and you sat on a splendid couch with a table arranged before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.
26爸 23:42 "And the sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort. And they put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26爸 23:43 "Then I said concerning her who was worn out by adulteries, 'Will they now commit adultery with her when she is [thus]?'
26爸 23:44 "But they went in to her as they would go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
26爸 23:45 "But they, righteous men, will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.
26爸 23:46 "For thus says the Lord GOD, 'Bring up a company against them, and give them over to terror and plunder.
26爸 23:47 'And the company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters and burn their houses with fire.
26爸 23:48 'Thus I shall make lewdness cease from the land, that all women may be admonished and not commit lewdness as you have done.
26爸 23:49 'And your lewdness will be requited upon you, and you will bear the penalty of [worshiping] your idols; thus you will know that I am the Lord GOD.' "
26爸 24:1 And the word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying,
26爸 24:2 "Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
26爸 24:3 "And speak a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Put on the pot, put [it] on, and also pour water in it;
26爸 24:4 Put in it the pieces, Every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; Fill [it] with choice bones.
26爸 24:5 "Take the choicest of the flock, And also pile wood under the pot. Make it boil vigorously. Also seethe its bones in it."
26爸 24:6 'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city, To the pot in which there is rust And whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, Without making a choice.
26爸 24:7 "For her blood is in her midst; She placed it on the bare rock; She did not pour it on the ground To cover it with dust.
26爸 24:8 "That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, That it may not be covered."
26爸 24:9 'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Woe to the bloody city! I also shall make the pile great.
26爸 24:10 "Heap on the wood, kindle the fire, Boil the flesh well, And mix in the spices, And let the bones be burned.
26爸 24:11 "Then set it empty on its coals, So that it may be hot, And its bronze may glow, And its filthiness may be melted in it, Its rust consumed.
26爸 24:12 "She has wearied [Me] with toil, Yet her great rust has not gone from her; [Let] her rust [be] in the fire!
26爸 24:13 "In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I [would] have cleansed you, Yet you are not clean, You will not be cleansed from your filthiness again, Until I have spent My wrath on you.
26爸 24:14 "I, the LORD, have spoken; it is coming and I shall act. I shall not relent, and I shall not pity, and I shall not be sorry; according to your ways and according to your deeds I shall judge you," declares the Lord GOD. '"
26爸 24:15 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 24:16 "Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a blow; but you shall not mourn, and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come.
26爸 24:17 "Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet, and do not cover [your] mustache, and do not eat the bread of men."
26爸 24:18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded.
26爸 24:19 And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things that you are doing mean for us?"
26爸 24:20 Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 24:21 'Speak to the house of Israel, "Thus says the Lord GOD,' Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the delight of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.
26爸 24:22 'And you will do as I have done; you will not cover [your] mustache, and you will not eat the bread of men.
26爸 24:23 'And your turbans will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet. You will not mourn, and you will not weep; but you will rot away in your iniquities, and you will groan to one another.
26爸 24:24 'Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done you will do; when it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.' "
26爸 24:25 'As for you, son of man, will [it] not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their pride, the desire of their eyes, and their heart's delight, their sons and their daughters,
26爸 24:26 that on that day he who escapes will come to you with information for [your] ears?
26爸 24:27 'On that day your mouth will be opened to him who escaped, and you will speak and be dumb no longer. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.' "
26爸 25:1 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 25:2 "Son of man, set your face toward the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them,
26爸 25:3 and say to the sons of Ammon, 'Hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you said,' Aha! 'against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into exile,
26爸 25:4 therefore, behold, I am going to give you to the sons of the east for a possession, and they will set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
26爸 25:5 "And I shall make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Thus you will know that I am the LORD."
26爸 25:6 'For thus says the Lord GOD, "Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the scorn of your soul against the land of Israel,
26爸 25:7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out My hand against you, and I shall give you for spoil to the nations. And I shall cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from the lands; I shall destroy you. Thus you will know that I am the LORD. "
26爸 25:8 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Moab and Seir say,' Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations, '
26爸 25:9 therefore, behold, I am going to deprive the flank of Moab of [its] cities, of its cities which are on its frontiers, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
26爸 25:10 and I will give it for a possession, along with the sons of Ammon, to the sons of the east, that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
26爸 25:11 "Thus I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD."
26爸 25:12 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because Edom has acted against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has incurred grievous guilt, and avenged themselves upon them,"
26爸 25:13 therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off man and beast from it. And I will lay it waste; from Teman even to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
26爸 25:14 "And I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel. Therefore, they will act in Edom according to My anger and according to My wrath; thus they will know My vengeance," declares the Lord GOD .
26爸 25:15 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the Philistines have acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with everlasting enmity,"
26爸 25:16 therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, even cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast.
26爸 25:17 "And I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I lay My vengeance on them." '"
26爸 26:1 Now it came about in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 26:2 "Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gateway of the peoples is broken; it has opened to me. I shall be filled, [now that] she is laid waste,'
26爸 26:3 therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
26爸 26:4 'And they will destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.
26爸 26:5 'She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,' declares the Lord GOD, 'and she will become spoil for the nations.
26爸 26:6 'Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be slain by the sword, and they will know that I am the LORD.' "
26爸 26:7 For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great army.
26爸 26:8 "He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, cast up a mound against you, and raise up a large shield against you.
26爸 26:9 "And the blow of his battering rams he will direct against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
26爸 26:10 "Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust [raised by] them will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of cavalry and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as men enter a city that is breached.
26爸 26:11 "With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will slay your people with the sword; and your strong pillars will come down to the ground.
26爸 26:12 "Also they will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise, break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water.
26爸 26:13 "So I will silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.
26爸 26:14 "And I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more, for I the LORD have spoken," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 26:15 Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre, "Shall not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter occurs in your midst?
26爸 26:16 "Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be appalled at you.
26爸 26:17 "And they will take up a lamentation over you and say to you, ' How you have perished, O inhabited one, From the seas, O renowned city, Which was mighty on the sea, She and her inhabitants, Who imposed her terror On all her inhabitants!
26爸 26:18 'Now the coastlands will tremble On the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands which are by the sea Will be terrified at your passing.' "
26爸 26:19 For thus says the Lord GOD, "When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities which are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep over you, and the great waters will cover you,
26爸 26:20 then I shall bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I shall make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient waste places, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I shall set glory in the land of the living.
26爸 26:21 "I shall bring terrors on you, and you will be no more; though you will be sought, you will never be found again," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 27:1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 27:2 "And you, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
26爸 27:3 and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "O Tyre, you have said,' I am perfect in beauty. '
26爸 27:4 "Your borders are in the heart of the seas; Your builders have perfected your beauty.
26爸 27:5 "They have made all [your] planks of fir trees from Senir; They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
26爸 27:6 "Of oaks from Bashan they have made your oars; With ivory they have inlaid your deck of boxwood from the coastlands of Cyprus.
26爸 27:7 "Your sail was of fine embroidered linen from Egypt So that it became your distinguishing mark; Your awning was blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah.
26爸 27:8 "The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; Your wise men, O Tyre, were aboard; they were your pilots.
26爸 27:9 "The elders of Gebal and her wise men were with you repairing your seams; All the ships of the sea and their sailors were with you in order to deal in your merchandise.
26爸 27:10 "Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, your men of war. They hung shield and helmet in you; they set forth your splendor.

26爸 28:1 The word of the LORD came again to me saying,
26爸 28:2 "Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, " Because your heart is lifted up And you have said,' I am a god, I sit in the seat of gods, In the heart of the seas ';Yet you are a man and not God, Although you make your heart like the heart of God--
26爸 28:3 Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; There is no secret that is a match for you.
26爸 28:4 "By your wisdom and understanding You have acquired riches for yourself, And have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries.
26爸 28:5 "By your great wisdom, by your trade You have increased your riches, And your heart is lifted up because of your riches--

26爸 28:10 'You will die the death of the uncircumcised By the hand of strangers, For I have spoken!' declares the Lord GOD! "'"
26爸 28:11 Again the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 28:12 "Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "You had the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

On the day that you were created They were prepared.
26爸 28:14 "You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you [there.] You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.

26爸 28:18 "By the multitude of your iniquities, In the unrighteousness of your trade, You profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you; It has consumed you, And I have turned you to ashes on the earth In the eyes of all who see you.
26爸 28:19 "All who know you among the peoples Are appalled at you; You have become terrified, And you will be no more." '"
26爸 28:20 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 28:21 "Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, prophesy against her,
26爸 28:22 and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, And I shall be glorified in your midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I execute judgments in her, And I shall manifest My holiness in her.

26爸 29:1 In the tenth year, in the tenth [month,] on the twelfth of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 29:2 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
26爸 29:3 "Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, The great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, That has said,' My Nile is mine, and I myself have made it. '

26爸 29:5 "And I shall abandon you to the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; You will fall on the open field; you will not be brought together or gathered. I have given you for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky.
26爸 29:6 "Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the LORD, Because they have been [only] a staff [made] of reed to the house of Israel.
26爸 29:7 "When they took hold of you with the hand, You broke and tore all their hands; And when they leaned on you, You broke and made all their loins quake."
26爸 29:8 'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I shall bring upon you a sword, and I shall cut off from you man and beast.

26爸 29:10 therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol [to] Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia.
26爸 29:11 "A man's foot will not pass through it, and the foot of a beast will not pass through it, and it will not be inhabited for forty years.
26爸 29:12 "So I shall make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands. And her cities, in the midst of cities that are laid waste, will be desolate forty years; and I shall scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands."
26爸 29:13 'For thus says the Lord GOD, "At the end of forty years I shall gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.
26爸 29:14 "And I shall turn the fortunes of Egypt and shall make them return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin; and there they will be a lowly kingdom.
26爸 29:15 "It will be the lowest of the kingdoms; and it will never again lift itself up above the nations. And I shall make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.
26爸 29:16 "And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing to mind the iniquity of their having turned to Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD." '"
26爸 29:17 Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first [month,] on the first of the month, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 29:18 "Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it."
26爸 29:19 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I shall give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her wealth, and capture her spoil and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army.
26爸 29:20 "I have given him the land of Egypt [for] his labor which he performed, because they acted for Me," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 29:21 "On that day I shall make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I shall open your mouth in their midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
26爸 30:1 The word of the LORD came again to me saying,
26爸 30:2 "Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Wail,' Alas for the day!'
26爸 30:3 "For the day is near, Even the day of the LORD is near; It will be a day of clouds, A time [of doom] for the nations.
26爸 30:4 "And a sword will come upon Egypt, And anguish will be in Ethiopia, When the slain fall in Egypt, They take away her wealth, And her foundations are torn down.
26爸 30:5 "Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya, and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword."
26爸 30:6 'Thus says the LORD, "Indeed, those who support Egypt will fall, And the pride of her power will come down; From Migdol [to] Syene They will fall within her by the sword," Declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 30:7 "And they will be desolate In the midst of the desolated lands; And her cities will be In the midst of the devastated cities.
26爸 30:8 "And they will know that I am the LORD, When I set a fire in Egypt And all her helpers are broken.
26爸 30:9 "On that day messengers will go forth from Me in ships to frighten secure Ethiopia; and anguish will be on them as on the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes!"
26爸 30:10 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also make the multitude of Egypt cease By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
26爸 30:11 "He and his people with him, The most ruthless of the nations, Will be brought in to destroy the land; And they will draw their swords against Egypt And fill the land with the slain.
26爸 30:12 "Moreover, I will make the Nile canals dry And sell the land into the hands of evil men. And I will make the land desolate, And all that is in it, By the hand of strangers; I, the LORD, have spoken."
26爸 30:13 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also destroy the idols And make the images cease from Memphis. And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

26爸 30:17 "The young men of On and of Pi-beseth Will fall by the sword, And the women will go into captivity.
26爸 30:18 "And in Tehaphnehes the day will be dark When I break there the yoke bars of Egypt. Then the pride of her power will cease in her; A cloud will cover her, And her daughters will go into captivity.
26爸 30:19 "Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, And they will know that I am the LORD." '"
26爸 30:20 And it came about in the eleventh year, in the first [month,] on the seventh of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 30:21 "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, that it may be strong to hold the sword.
26爸 30:22 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong and the broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
26爸 30:23 'And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
26爸 30:24 'For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, so that he will groan before him with the groanings of a wounded man.
26爸 30:25 'Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.
26爸 30:26 'When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, then they will know that I am the LORD.' "
26爸 31:1 And it came about in the eleventh year, in the third [month,] on the first of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 31:2 "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude, ' Whom are you like in your greatness?
26爸 31:3 'Behold, Assyria [was] a cedar in Lebanon With beautiful branches and forest shade, And very high; And its top was among the clouds.
26爸 31:4 'The waters made it grow, the deep made it high. With its rivers it continually extended all around its planting place, And it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.
26爸 31:5 'Therefore its height was loftier than all the trees of the field And its boughs became many and its branches long Because of many waters as it spread them out.
26爸 31:6 'All the birds of the heavens nested in its boughs, And under its branches all the beasts of the field gave birth, And all great nations lived under its shade.
26爸 31:7 'So it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; For its roots extended to many waters.
26爸 31:8 'The cedars in God's garden could not match it; The cypresses could not compare with its boughs, And the plane trees could not match its branches. No tree in God's garden could compare with it in its beauty.
26爸 31:9 'I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches, And all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God, were jealous of it.
26爸 31:10 'Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Because it is high in stature, and it has set its top among the clouds, and its heart is haughty in its loftiness,
26爸 31:11 therefore, I will give it into the hand of a despot of the nations; he will thoroughly deal with it. According to its wickedness I have driven it away.
26爸 31:12 "And alien tyrants of the nations have cut it down and left it; on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land. And all the peoples of the earth have gone down from its shade and left it.

26爸 31:14 in order that all the trees by the waters may not be exalted in their stature, nor set their top among the clouds, nor their well-watered mighty ones stand [erect] in their height. For they have all been given over to death, to the earth beneath, among the sons of men, with those who go down to the pit. "
26爸 31:15 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day when it went down to Sheol I caused lamentations; I closed the deep over it and held back its rivers. And [its] many waters were stopped up, and I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted away on account of it.
26爸 31:16 "I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall when I made it go down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit; and all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the earth beneath.
26爸 31:17 "They also went down with it to Sheol to those who were slain by the sword; and those who were its strength lived under its shade among the nations.
26爸 31:18 "To which among the trees of Eden are you thus equal in glory and greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth beneath; you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. So is Pharaoh and all his multitude!

26爸 32:1 And it came about in the twelfth year, in the twelfth [month,] on the first of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 32:2 "Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, 'You compared yourself to a young lion of the nations, Yet you are like the monster in the seas; And you burst forth in your rivers, And muddied the waters with your feet, And fouled their rivers.'"
26爸 32:3 Thus says the Lord GOD, "Now I will spread My net over you With a company of many peoples, And they shall lift you up in My net.
26爸 32:4 "And I will leave you on the land; I will cast you on the open field. And I will cause all the birds of the heavens to dwell on you, And I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with you.
26爸 32:5 "And I will lay your flesh on the mountains, And fill the valleys with your refuse.

26爸 32:8 "All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you And will set darkness on your land," Declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 32:9 "I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into lands which you have not known.
26爸 32:10 "And I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of your fall."
26爸 32:11 For thus says the Lord GOD, "The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
26爸 32:12 "By the swords of the mighty ones I will cause your multitude to fall; all of them are tyrants of the nations, And they shall devastate the pride of Egypt, And all its multitude shall be destroyed.
26爸 32:13 "I will also destroy all its cattle from beside many waters; And the foot of man shall not muddy them anymore, And the hoofs of beasts shall not muddy them.
26爸 32:14 "Then I will make their waters settle, And will cause their rivers to run like oil," Declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 32:15 "When I make the land of Egypt a desolation, And the land is destitute of that which filled it, When I smite all those who live in it, Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
26爸 32:16 "This is a lamentation and they shall chant it. The daughters of the nations shall chant it. Over Egypt and over all her multitude they shall chant it," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 32:17 And it came about in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 32:18 "Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and bring it down, her and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the nether world, with those who go down to the pit;
26爸 32:19 'Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and make your bed with the uncircumcised.'
26爸 32:20 "They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is given over to the sword; they have drawn her and all her multitudes away.
26爸 32:21 "The strong among the mighty ones shall speak of him [and] his helpers from the midst of Sheol, 'They have gone down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.'
26爸 32:22 "Assyria is there and all her company; her graves are round about her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword,
26爸 32:23 whose graves are set in the remotest parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living.
26爸 32:24 "Elam is there and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who instilled their terror in the land of the living, and bore their disgrace with those who went down to the pit.
26爸 32:25 "They have made a bed for her among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around it, they are all uncircumcised, slain by the sword (although their terror was instilled in the land of the living), and they bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit; they were put in the midst of the slain.
26爸 32:26 "Meshech, Tubal and all their multitude are there; their graves surround them. All of them were slain by the sword uncircumcised, though they instilled their terror in the land of the living.
26爸 32:27 "Nor do they lie beside the fallen heroes of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and whose swords were laid under their heads; but the punishment for their iniquity rested on their bones, though the terror of [these] heroes [was] once in the land of the living.
26爸 32:28 "But in the midst of the uncircumcised you will be broken and lie with those slain by the sword.
26爸 32:29 "There also is Edom, its kings, and all its princes, who for [all] their might are laid with those slain by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
26爸 32:30 "There also are the chiefs of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who in spite of the terror resulting from their might, in shame went down with the slain. So they lay down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bore their disgrace with those who go down to the pit.
26爸 32:31 "These Pharaoh will see, and he will be comforted for all his multitude slain by the sword, [even] Pharaoh and all his army," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 32:32 "Though I instilled a terror of him in the land of the living, yet he will be made to lie down among [the] uncircumcised [along] with those slain by the sword, [even] Pharaoh and all his multitude," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 33:1 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 33:2 "Son of man, speak to the sons of your people, and say to them, 'If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman;
26爸 33:3 and he sees the sword coming upon the land, and he blows on the trumpet and warns the people,
26爸 33:4 then he who hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his [own] head.
26爸 33:5 'He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life.
26爸 33:6 'But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require from the watchman's hand.'
26爸 33:7 "Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth, and give them warning from Me.
26爸 33:8 "When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you shall surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand.
26爸 33:9 "But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your life.
26爸 33:10 "Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus you have spoken, saying," Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting away in them; how then can we survive? "'
26爸 33:11 "Say to them, 'As I live!' declares the Lord GOD, 'I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then will you die, O house of Israel?'
26爸 33:12 "And you, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, 'The righteousness of a righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not stumble because of it in the day when he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous man will not be able to live by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.'
26爸 33:13 "When I say to the righteous he will surely live, and he [so] trusts in his righteousness that he commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but in that same iniquity of his which he has committed he will die.
26爸 33:14 "But when I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness,
26爸 33:15 [if a] wicked man restores a pledge, pays back what he has taken by robbery, walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing iniquity, he will surely live; he shall not die.
26爸 33:16 "None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has practiced justice and righteousness; he will surely live.
26爸 33:17 "Yet your fellow citizens say, 'The way of the Lord is not right,' when it is their own way that is not right.
26爸 33:18 "When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, then he shall die in it.
26爸 33:19 "But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them.
26爸 33:20 "Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not right.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways."
26爸 33:21 Now it came about in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month, that the refugees from Jerusalem came to me, saying, "The city has been taken."
26爸 33:22 Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me in the evening, before the refugees came. And He opened my mouth at the time [they] came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer speechless.
26爸 33:23 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 33:24 "Son of man, they who live in these waste places in the land of Israel are saying, 'Abraham was [only] one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many the land has been given as a possession.'
26爸 33:25 "Therefore, say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," You eat [meat] with the blood [in it,] lift up your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
26爸 33:26 "You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife. Should you then possess the land? '"
26爸 33:27 "Thus you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of pestilence.
26爸 33:28 "And I shall make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that no one will pass through.
26爸 33:29 "Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed." '
26爸 33:30 "But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, 'Come now, and hear what the message is which comes forth from the LORD.'
26爸 33:31 "And they come to you as people come, and sit before you [as] My people, and hear your words, but they do not do them, for they do the lustful desires [expressed] by their mouth, [and] their heart goes after their gain.
26爸 33:32 "And behold, you are to them like a sensual song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not practice them.
26爸 33:33 "So when it comes to pass-- as surely it will-- then they will know that a prophet has been in their midst."
26爸 34:1 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 34:2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
26爸 34:3 "You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat [sheep] without feeding the flock.
26爸 34:4 "Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them.
26爸 34:5 "And they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered.
26爸 34:6 "My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill, and My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth; and there was no one to search or seek [for them.]" '"
26爸 34:7 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD：
26爸 34:8 "As I live," declares the Lord GOD, "surely because My flock has become a prey, My flock has even become food for all the beasts of the field for lack of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but [rather] the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock;
26爸 34:9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD：
26爸 34:10 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I shall demand My sheep from them and make them cease from feeding sheep. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I shall deliver My flock from their mouth, that they may not be food for them."' "
26爸 34:11 For thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
26爸 34:12 "As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day.
26爸 34:13 "And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land.
26爸 34:14 "I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down in good grazing ground, and they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
26爸 34:15 "I will feed My flock and I will lead them to rest," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 34:16 "I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken, and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with judgment.
26爸 34:17 "And as for you, My flock, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Behold, I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats.
26爸 34:18 'Is it too slight a thing for you that you should feed in the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? Or that you should drink of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet?
26爸 34:19 'And as for My flock, they must eat what you tread down with your feet, and they must drink what you foul with your feet!' "
26爸 34:20 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them, "Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
26爸 34:21 "Because you push with side and with shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad,
26爸 34:22 therefore, I will deliver My flock, and they will no longer be a prey; and I will judge between one sheep and another.
26爸 34:23 "Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd.
26爸 34:24 "And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken.
26爸 34:25 "And I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful beasts from the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
26爸 34:26 "And I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will cause showers to come down in their season; they will be showers of blessing.
26爸 34:27 "Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and have delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
26爸 34:28 "And they will no longer be a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make [them] afraid.
26爸 34:29 "And I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will not again be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore.
26爸 34:30 "Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 34:31 "As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are men, and I am your God," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 35:1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 35:2 "Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
26爸 35:3 and say to it, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, And I will stretch out My hand against you, And I will make you a desolation and a waste.
26爸 35:4 "I will lay waste your cities, And you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 35:5 "Because you have had everlasting enmity and have delivered the sons of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of the punishment of the end,
26爸 35:6 therefore, as I live, "declares the Lord GOD," I will give you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you.
26爸 35:7 "And I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it the one who passes through and returns.
26爸 35:8 "And I will fill its mountains with its slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain by the sword will fall.
26爸 35:9 "I will make you an everlasting desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 35:10 "Because you have said, 'These two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,' although the LORD was there,
26爸 35:11 therefore, as I live, "declares the Lord GOD," I will deal [with you] according to your anger and according to your envy which you showed because of your hatred against them; so I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
26爸 35:12 "Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all your revilings which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given to us for food.'
26爸 35:13 "And you have spoken arrogantly against Me and have multiplied your words against Me; I have heard."
26爸 35:14 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation.
26爸 35:15 "As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD." '
26爸 36:1 "And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ' O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
26爸 36:2 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Because the enemy has spoken against you,' Aha! 'and,' The everlasting heights have become our possession, '
26爸 36:3 therefore, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "For good cause they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, that you should become a possession of the rest of the nations, and you have been taken up in the talk and the whispering of the people."' "
26爸 36:4 'Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the forsaken cities, which have become a prey and a derision to the rest of the nations which are round about,
26爸 36:5 therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Surely in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy [and] with scorn of soul, to drive it out for a prey."
26爸 36:6 'Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys, "Thus says the Lord GOD,' Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations. '
26爸 36:7 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, 'I have sworn that surely the nations which are around you will themselves endure their insults.
26爸 36:8 'But you, O mountains of Israel, you will put forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel; for they will soon come.
26爸 36:9 'For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be cultivated and sown.
26爸 36:10 'And I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.
26爸 36:11 'And I will multiply on you man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly and will treat you better than at the first. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.
26爸 36:12 'Yes, I will cause men-- My people Israel-- to walk on you and possess you, so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.'
26爸 36:13 "Thus says the Lord GOD, 'Because they say to you," You are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children, "
26爸 36:14 therefore, you will no longer devour men, and no longer bereave your nation of children, 'declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 36:15 "And I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you cause your nation to stumble any longer," declares the Lord GOD. '"
26爸 36:16 Then the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 36:17 "Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
26爸 36:18 "Therefore, I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols.
26爸 36:19 "Also I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them.
26爸 36:20 "When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD; yet they have come out of His land.'
26爸 36:21 "But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.
26爸 36:22 "Therefore, say to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.
26爸 36:23 "And I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD," declares the Lord GOD, " when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight.
26爸 36:24 "For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands, and bring you into your own land.
26爸 36:25 "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.
26爸 36:26 "Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
26爸 36:27 "And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.
26爸 36:28 "And you will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God.
26爸 36:29 "Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you.
26爸 36:30 "And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, that you may not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations.
26爸 36:31 "Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and your abominations.
26爸 36:32 "I am not doing [this] for your sake," declares the Lord GOD, "let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!"
26爸 36:33 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be rebuilt.
26爸 36:34 "And the desolate land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in the sight of everyone who passed by.
26爸 36:35 "And they will say, 'This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified [and] inhabited.'
26爸 36:36 "Then the nations that are left round about you will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places [and] planted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken and will do it."
26爸 36:37 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "This also I will let the house of Israel ask Me to do for them： I will increase their men like a flock.
26爸 36:38 "Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD." '"
26爸 37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones.
26爸 37:2 And He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, [there were] very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, [they were] very dry.
26爸 37:3 And He said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, Thou knowest."
26爸 37:4 Again He said to me, "Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, ' O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. '
26爸 37:5 "Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones, 'Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life.
26爸 37:6 'And I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin, and put breath in you that you may come alive; and you will know that I am the LORD.' "
26爸 37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
26爸 37:8 And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew, and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.
26爸 37:9 Then He said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life. "'"
26爸 37:10 So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they came to life, and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
26爸 37:11 Then He said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.'
26爸 37:12 "Therefore prophesy, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
26爸 37:13 "Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, My people.
26爸 37:14 "And I will put My Spirit within you, and you will come to life, and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken and done it," declares the LORD. '"
26爸 37:15 The word of the LORD came again to me saying,
26爸 37:16 "And you, son of man, take for yourself one stick and write on it, ' For Judah and for the sons of Israel, his companions ';then take another stick and write on it,' For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel, his companions. '
26爸 37:17 "Then join them for yourself one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
26爸 37:18 "And when the sons of your people speak to you saying, 'Will you not declare to us what you mean by these?'
26爸 37:19 say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand."'
26爸 37:20 "And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
26爸 37:21 "And say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;
26爸 37:22 and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king for all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, and they will no longer be divided into two kingdoms.
26爸 37:23 "And they will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. And they will be My people, and I will be their God.
26爸 37:24 "And My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances, and keep My statutes, and observe them.
26爸 37:25 "And they shall live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons, and their sons' sons, forever; and David My servant shall be their prince forever.
26爸 37:26 "And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.
26爸 37:27 "My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
26爸 37:28 "And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever." '"
26爸 38:1 And the word of the LORD came to me saying,
26爸 38:2 "Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
26爸 38:3 and say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
26爸 38:4 "And I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them splendidly attired, a great company [with] buckler and shield, all of them wielding swords;

26爸 38:8 "After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, [whose inhabitants] have been gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but its people were brought out from the nations, and they are living securely, all of them.
26爸 38:9 "And you will go up, you will come like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your troops, and many peoples with you."
26爸 38:10 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "It will come about on that day, that thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil plan,

26爸 38:13 "Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its villages, will say to you, 'Have you come to capture spoil? Have you assembled your company to seize plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to capture great spoil?'" '
26爸 38:14 "Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, 'Thus says the Lord GOD," On that day when My people Israel are living securely, will you not know [it]?
26爸 38:15 "And you will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army;

26爸 39:11 "And it will come about on that day that I shall give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will block off the passers-by. So they will bury Gog there with all his multitude, and they will call [it] the valley of Hamon-gog.
26爸 39:12 "For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
26爸 39:13 "Even all the people of the land will bury [them;] and it will be to their renown [on] the day that I glorify Myself," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 39:14 "And they will set apart men who will constantly pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, even those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.
26爸 39:15 "And as those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a man's bone, then he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
26爸 39:16 "And even [the] name of [the] city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land." '
26爸 39:17 "And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'Speak to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field," Assemble and come, gather from every side to My sacrifice which I am going to sacrifice for you, as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.
26爸 39:18 "You shall eat the flesh of mighty men, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, as [though they were] rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
26爸 39:19 "So you will eat fat until you are glutted, and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
26爸 39:20 "And you will be glutted at My table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all the men of war," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 39:21 "And I shall set My glory among the nations; and all the nations will see My judgment which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them.
26爸 39:22 "And the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God from that day onward.
26爸 39:23 "And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity because they acted treacherously against Me, and I hid My face from them; so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword.
26爸 39:24 "According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I dealt with them, and I hid My face from them." '"
26爸 39:25 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Now I shall restore the fortunes of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I shall be jealous for My holy name.
26爸 39:26 "And they shall forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their [own] land with no one to make them afraid.
26爸 39:27 "When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations.
26爸 39:28 "Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them [again] to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer.
26爸 39:29 "And I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me and He brought me there.
26爸 40:2 In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain; and on it to the south [there was] a structure like a city.
26爸 40:3 So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway.
26爸 40:4 And the man said to me, "Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and give attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here in order to show [it] to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see."
26爸 40:5 And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, [each of which was] a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod.
26爸 40:6 Then he went to the gate which faced east, went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold [was] one rod in width.
26爸 40:7 And the guardroom [was] one rod long and one rod wide; and [there were] five cubits between the guardrooms. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward [was] one rod.
26爸 40:8 Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod.
26爸 40:9 And he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its side pillars, two cubits. And the porch of the gate was faced inward.
26爸 40:10 And the guardrooms of the gate toward the east [numbered] three on each side; the three of them had the same measurement. The side pillars also had the same measurement on each side.
26爸 40:11 And he measured the width of the gateway, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
26爸 40:12 And [there was] a barrier [wall] one cubit [wide] in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms [were] six cubits [square] on each side.
26爸 40:13 And he measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from [one] door to [the] door opposite.
26爸 40:14 And he made the side pillars sixty cubits [high;] the gate [extended] round about to the side pillar of the courtyard.
26爸 40:15 And [from] the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate [was] fifty cubits.
26爸 40:16 And [there were] shuttered windows [looking] toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And [there were] windows all around inside; and on [each] side pillar [were] palm tree ornaments.
26爸 40:17 Then he brought me into the outer court, and behold, [there were] chambers and a pavement, made for the court all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
26爸 40:18 And the pavement ([that is,] the lower pavement) [was] by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates.
26爸 40:19 Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north.
26爸 40:20 And [as for] the gate of the outer court which faced the north, he measured its length and its width.
26爸 40:21 And it had three guardrooms on each side; and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate. Its length [was] fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
26爸 40:22 And its windows, and its porches, and its palm tree ornaments [had] the same measurements as the gate which faced toward the east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch [was] in front of them.
26爸 40:23 And the inner court had a gate opposite the gate on the north as well as [the gate] on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate.
26爸 40:24 Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements.
26爸 40:25 And the gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows; the length [was] fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
26爸 40:26 And [there were] seven steps going up to it, and its porches [were] in front of them; and it had palm tree ornaments on its side pillars, one on each side.
26爸 40:27 And the inner court had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
26爸 40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements.
26爸 40:29 Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches [were] according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it [was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26爸 40:30 And [there were] porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
26爸 40:31 And its porches [were] toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments [were] on its side pillars, and its stairway had eight steps.
26爸 40:32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements.
26爸 40:33 Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches [were] according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it [was] fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
26爸 40:34 And its porches [were] toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments [were] on its side pillars, on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
26爸 40:35 Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured [it] according to those same measurements,
26爸 40:36 [with] its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its porches. And the gate had windows all around; the length [was] fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.
26爸 40:37 And its side pillars [were] toward the outer court; and palm tree ornaments [were] on its side pillars on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
26爸 40:38 And a chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering.
26爸 40:39 And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.
26爸 40:40 And on the outer side, as one went up to the gateway toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate [were] two tables.
26爸 40:41 Four tables [were] on each side next to the gate; [or,] eight tables on which they slaughter [sacrifices.]
26爸 40:42 And for the burnt offering [there were] four tables of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they lay the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
26爸 40:43 And the double hooks, one handbreadth in length, were installed in the house all around; and on the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.
26爸 40:44 And from the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, [one of] which was at the side of the north gate, with its front toward the south, and one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.
26爸 40:45 And he said to me, "This is the chamber which faces toward the south, [intended] for the priests who keep charge of the temple;
26爸 40:46 but the chamber which faces toward the north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the LORD to minister to Him. "
26爸 40:47 And he measured the court, a [perfect] square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple.
26爸 40:48 Then he brought me to the porch of the temple and measured [each] side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side.
26爸 40:49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended [were] columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side.
26爸 41:1 Then he brought me to the nave and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side [was] the width of the side pillar.
26爸 41:2 And the width of the entrance [was] ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.
26爸 41:3 Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits [high;] and the width of the doorway, seven cubits.
26爸 41:4 And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the nave; and he said to me, "This is the most holy [place.]"
26爸 41:5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around about the house on every side.
26爸 41:6 And the side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in each story; and the side chambers extended to the wall which [ stood] on their inward side all around, that they might be fastened, and not be fastened into the wall of the temple [itself.]
26爸 41:7 And the side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story. Because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple, therefore the width of the temple [increased] as it went higher; and thus one went up from the lowest [story] to the highest by way of the second [story.]
26爸 41:8 I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits [in height.]
26爸 41:9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers belonging to the temple
26爸 41:10 and the [outer] chambers [was] twenty cubits in width all around the temple on every side.
26爸 41:11 And the doorways of the side chambers toward the free space [consisted of] one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around.
26爸 41:12 And the building that [was] in front of the separate area at the side toward the west [was] seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length [was] ninety cubits.
26爸 41:13 Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; the separate area with the building and its walls [were] also a hundred cubits long.
26爸 41:14 Also the width of the front of the temple and [that of] the separate areas along the east [side totaled] a hundred cubits.
26爸 41:15 And he measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits; [ he] also [measured] the inner nave and the porches of the court.
26爸 41:16 The thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries round about their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and [from] the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),
26爸 41:17 over the entrance, and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement.
26爸 41:18 And it was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces,
26爸 41:19 a man's face toward the palm tree on one side, and a young lion's face toward the palm tree on the other side; they were carved on all the house all around.
26爸 41:20 From the ground to above the entrance cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as [on] the wall of the nave.
26爸 41:21 The doorposts of the nave were square; as for the front of the sanctuary, the appearance of one doorpost was like that of the other.
26爸 41:22 The altar [was] of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; its corners, its base, and its sides [were] of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD."
26爸 41:23 And the nave and the sanctuary each had a double door.
26爸 41:24 And each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two [leaves] for one door and two leaves for the other.
26爸 41:25 Also there were carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and [there was] a threshold of wood on the front of the porch outside.
26爸 41:26 And [there were] latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; thus [were] the side chambers of the house and the thresholds.
26爸 42:1 Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which [was] opposite the separate area and opposite the building toward the north.
26爸 42:2 Along the length, [which was] a hundred cubits, [was] the north door; the width [was] fifty cubits.
26爸 42:3 Opposite the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, [was] gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories.
26爸 42:4 And before the chambers [was] an inner walk ten cubits wide, a way of one [hundred] cubits; and their openings [were] on the north.
26爸 42:5 Now the upper chambers [were] smaller because the galleries took more [space] away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building.
26爸 42:6 For they [were] in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore [the upper chambers] were set back from the ground upward, more than the lower and middle ones.
26爸 42:7 As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, its length [was] fifty cubits.
26爸 42:8 For the length of the chambers which [were] in the outer court [was] fifty cubits; and behold, [the length of those] facing the temple [was] a hundred cubits.
26爸 42:9 And below these chambers [was] the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.
26爸 42:10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, [there were] chambers.
26爸 42:11 And the way in front of them [was] like the appearance of the chambers which [were] on the north, according to their length so was their width; and all their exits [were] both according to their arrangements and openings.
26爸 42:12 And corresponding to the openings of the chambers which were toward the south was an opening at the head of the way, the way in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters them.
26爸 42:13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers [and] the south chambers, which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the LORD shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; for the place is holy.
26爸 42:14 "When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer court from the sanctuary without laying there their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they shall approach that which is for the people."
26爸 42:15 Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced toward the east, and measured it all around.
26爸 42:16 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, by the measuring reed.
26爸 42:17 He measured on the north side five hundred reeds by the measuring reed.
26爸 42:18 On the south side he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
26爸 42:19 He turned to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
26爸 42:20 He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, the length five hundred and the width five hundred, to divide between the holy and the profane.
26爸 43:1 Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east;
26爸 43:2 and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.
26爸 43:3 And [it was] like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions [were] like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
26爸 43:4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east.
26爸 43:5 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
26爸 43:6 Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me.
26爸 43:7 And He said to me, "Son of man, [this is] the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die,
26爸 43:8 by setting their threshold by My threshold, and their door post beside My door post, with [only] the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger.
26爸 43:9 "Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever.
26爸 43:10 "As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the plan.
26爸 43:11 "And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its structure, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write [it] in their sight, so that they may observe its whole design and all its statutes, and do them.
26爸 43:12 "This is the law of the house： its entire area on the top of the mountain all around [shall be] most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
26爸 43:13 "And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth)： the base [shall be] a cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border on its edge round about one span; and this [shall be] the [height of the] base of the altar.
26爸 43:14 "And from the base on the ground to the lower ledge [shall be] two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge [shall be] four cubits, and the width one cubit.
26爸 43:15 "And the altar hearth [shall be] four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall extend upwards four horns.
26爸 43:16 "Now the altar hearth [shall be] twelve [cubits] long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.
26爸 43:17 "And the ledge [shall be] fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen wide in its four sides, the border around it [shall be] half a cubit, and its base [shall be] a cubit round about; and its steps shall face the east."
26爸 43:18 And He said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, 'These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it.
26爸 43:19 'And you shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who draw near to Me to minister to Me,' declares the Lord GOD, 'a young bull for a sin offering.
26爸 43:20 'And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
26爸 43:21 'You shall also take the bull for the sin offering; and it [shall be] burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
26爸 43:22 'And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed [it] with the bull.
26爸 43:23 'When you have finished cleansing [it,] you shall present a young bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock.
26爸 43:24 'And you shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
26爸 43:25 'For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared.
26爸 43:26 'For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
26爸 43:27 'And when they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,' declares the Lord GOD ."
26爸 44:1 Then He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east; and it was shut.
26爸 44:2 And the LORD said to me, "This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.
26爸 44:3 "As for the prince, he shall sit in it as prince to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the same way."
26爸 44:4 Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD, and I fell on my face.
26爸 44:5 And the LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the LORD and concerning all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with all exits of the sanctuary.
26爸 44:6 "And you shall say to the rebellious ones, to the house of Israel, ' Thus says the Lord GOD," Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel,
26爸 44:7 when you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to profane it, [even] My house, when you offered My food, the fat and the blood; for they made My covenant void-- [this] in addition to all your abominations.
26爸 44:8 "And you have not kept charge of My holy things yourselves, but you have set [foreigners] to keep charge of My sanctuary."
26爸 44:9 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the sons of Israel, shall enter My sanctuary.
26爸 44:10 "But the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear the punishment for their iniquity.
26爸 44:11 "Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house; they shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
26爸 44:12 "Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn against them," declares the Lord GOD, "that they shall bear the punishment for their iniquity.
26爸 44:13 "And they shall not come near to Me to serve as a priest to Me, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.
26爸 44:14 "Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the house, of all its service, and of all that shall be done in it.
26爸 44:15 "But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from Me, shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer Me the fat and the blood," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 44:16 "They shall enter My sanctuary; they shall come near to My table to minister to Me and keep My charge.
26爸 44:17 "And it shall be that when they enter at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and wool shall not be on them while they are ministering in the gates of the inner court and in the house.
26爸 44:18 "Linen turbans shall be on their heads, and linen undergarments shall be on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with [anything which makes them] sweat.
26爸 44:19 "And when they go out into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers; then they shall put on other garments that they may not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
26爸 44:20 "Also they shall not shave their heads, yet they shall not let their locks grow long; they shall only trim [the hair of] their heads.
26爸 44:21 "Nor shall any of the priests drink wine when they enter the inner court.
26爸 44:22 "And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman but shall take virgins from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
26爸 44:23 "Moreover, they shall teach My people [the difference] between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
26爸 44:24 "And in a dispute they shall take their stand to judge; they shall judge it according to My ordinances. They shall also keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed feasts, and sanctify My sabbaths.
26爸 44:25 "And they shall not go to a dead person to defile [themselves;] however, for father, for mother, for son, for daughter, for brother, or for a sister who has not had a husband, they may defile themselves.
26爸 44:26 "And after he is cleansed, seven days shall elapse for him.
26爸 44:27 "And on the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 44:28 "And it shall be with regard to an inheritance for them, [that] I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel-- I am their possession.

26爸 44:31 "The priests shall not eat any bird or beast that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces.
26爸 45:1 "And when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an allotment to the LORD, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of 250000 [cubits,] and the width shall be 100000. It shall be holy within all its boundary round about.
26爸 45:2 "Out of this there shall be for the holy place a square round about five hundred by five hundred [cubits,] and fifty cubits for its open space round about.
26爸 45:3 "And from this area you shall measure a length of 250000 [cubits,] and a width of 100000 [cubits;] and in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place.
26爸 45:4 "It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary.
26爸 45:5 "And [an area] 250000 [cubits] in length and 100000 in width shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house, [and] for their possession cities to dwell in.
26爸 45:6 "And you shall give the city possession of [an area] 50000 [cubits] wide and 250000 [cubits] long, alongside the allotment of the holy portion; it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
26爸 45:7 "And the prince shall have [land] on either side of the holy allotment and the property of the city, adjacent to the holy allotment and the property of the city, on the west side toward the west and on the east side toward the east, and in length comparable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
26爸 45:8 "This shall be his land for a possession in Israel; so My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give [the rest of] the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes."
26爸 45:9 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Enough, you princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction, and practice justice and righteousness. Stop your expropriations from My people," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 45:10 "You shall have just balances, a just ephah, and a just bath.
26爸 45:11 "The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity, so that the bath may contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; their standard shall be according to the homer.
26爸 45:12 "And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, [and] fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.
26爸 45:13 "This is the offering that you shall offer： a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley;
26爸 45:14 and the prescribed portion of oil ([namely,] the bath of oil), a tenth of a bath from [each] kor ([which is] ten baths [or] a homer, for ten baths are a homer);
26爸 45:15 and one sheep from [each] flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel-- for a grain offering, for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, "declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 45:16 "All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel.
26爸 45:17 "And it shall be the prince's part [to provide] the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the libations, at the feasts, on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, at all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel."
26爸 45:18 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "In the first [month,] on the first of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary.
26爸 45:19 "And the priest shall take some of the blood from the sin offering and put [it] on the door posts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.
26爸 45:20 "And thus you shall do on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone who goes astray or is naive; so you shall make atonement for the house.
26爸 45:21 "In the first [month,] on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
26爸 45:22 "And on that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
26爸 45:23 "And [during] the seven days of the feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days, and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
26爸 45:24 "And he shall provide as a grain offering an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
26爸 45:25 "In the seventh [month,] on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall provide like this, seven days for the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil."
26爸 46:1 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "The gate of the inner court facing east shall be shut the six working days; but it shall be opened on the sabbath day, and opened on the day of the new moon.
26爸 46:2 "And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
26爸 46:3 "The people of the land shall also worship at the doorway of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
26爸 46:4 "And the burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
26爸 46:5 and the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
26爸 46:6 "And on the day of the new moon [he shall offer] a young bull without blemish, also six lambs and a ram, [which] shall be without blemish.
26爸 46:7 "And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull, and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
26爸 46:8 "And when the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way.
26爸 46:9 "But when the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate. And he who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered but shall go straight out.
26爸 46:10 "And when they go in, the prince shall go in among them; and when they go out, he shall go out.
26爸 46:11 "And at the festivals and the appointed feasts the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.
26爸 46:12 "And when the prince provides a freewill offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings [as] a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall provide his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out.
26爸 46:13 "And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
26爸 46:14 "Also you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the LORD continually by a perpetual ordinance.
26爸 46:15 "Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering."
26爸 46:16 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "If the prince gives a gift [out of] his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
26爸 46:17 "But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance [shall be] only his sons'; it shall belong to them.
26爸 46:18 "And the prince shall not take from the people's inheritance, thrusting them out of their possession; he shall give his sons inheritance from his own possession so that My people shall not be scattered, anyone from his possession." '"
26爸 46:19 Then he brought me through the entrance, which [was] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, there [was] a place at the extreme rear toward the west.
26爸 46:20 And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, [and] where they shall bake the grain offering, in order that they may not bring [them] out into the outer court to transmit holiness to the people."
26爸 46:21 Then he brought me out into the outer court and led me across to the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court [there was] a [small] court.
26爸 46:22 In the four corners of the court [there were] enclosed courts, forty [cubits] long and thirty wide; these four in the corners [were] the same size.
26爸 46:23 And [there was] a row [of masonry] round about in them, around the four of them, and boiling places were made under the rows round about.
26爸 46:24 Then he said to me, "These are the boiling places where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
26爸 47:1 Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right side of the house, from south of the altar.
26爸 47:2 And he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate by way of [the gate] that faces east. And behold, water was trickling from the south side.
26爸 47:3 When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water [reaching] the ankles.
26爸 47:4 Again he measured a thousand and led me through the water, water [reaching] the knees. Again he measured a thousand and led me through [the water,] water [reaching] the loins.
26爸 47:5 Again he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not ford, for the water had risen, [enough] water to swim in, a river that could not be forded.
26爸 47:6 And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen [this]?" Then he brought me back to the bank of the river.
26爸 47:7 Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river there [were] very many trees on the one side and on the other.
26爸 47:8 Then he said to me, "These waters go out toward the eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being made to flow into the sea, and the waters [of the sea] become fresh.
26爸 47:9 "And it will come about that every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes, will live. And there will be very many fish, for these waters go there, and [the others] become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
26爸 47:10 "And it will come about that fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to Eneglaim there will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish will be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.
26爸 47:11 "But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
26爸 47:12 "And by the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all [kinds of] trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear every month because their water flows from the sanctuary, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing."
26爸 47:13 Thus says the Lord GOD, "This [shall be] the boundary by which you shall divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph [shall have two] portions.
26爸 47:14 "And you shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other; for I swore to give it to your forefathers, and this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.
26爸 47:15 "And this [shall be] the boundary of the land： on the north side, from the Great Sea [by] the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
26爸 47:16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
26爸 47:17 "And the boundary shall extend from the sea [to] Hazar-enan [at] the border of Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
26爸 47:18 "And the east side, from between Hauran, Damascus, Gilead, and the land of Israel, [shall be] the Jordan; from the [north] border to the eastern sea you shall measure. This is the east side.
26爸 47:19 "And the south side toward the south [shall extend] from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt, and] to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south.
26爸 47:20 "And the west side [shall be] the Great Sea, from the [south] border to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the west side.
26爸 47:21 "So you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
26爸 47:22 "And it will come about that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the aliens who stay in your midst, who bring forth sons in your midst. And they shall be to you as the native-born among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
26爸 47:23 "And it will come about that in the tribe with which the alien stays, there you shall give [him] his inheritance," declares the Lord GOD.
26爸 48:1 "Now these are the names of the tribes： from the northern extremity, beside the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, [as far as] Hazar-enan [ at] the border of Damascus, toward the north beside Hamath, running from east to west, Dan, one [portion.]
26爸 48:2 "And beside the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one [portion.]

26爸 48:11 "[It shall be] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
26爸 48:12 "And it shall be an allotment to them from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, by the border of the Levites.
26爸 48:13 "And alongside the border of the priests the Levites [shall have] 250000 [cubits] in length and 100000 in width. The whole length [shall be] 250000 [cubits] and the width 100000.

27
27窜 1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
27窜 1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.
27窜 1:3 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,
27窜 1:4 youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every [branch of] wisdom, endowed with understanding, and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king's court; and [he ordered him] to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
27窜 1:5 And the king appointed for them a daily ration from the king's choice food and from the wine which he drank, and [appointed] that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king's personal service.
27窜 1:6 Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
27窜 1:7 Then the commander of the officials assigned [new] names to them; and to Daniel he assigned [the name] Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach, and to Azariah Abed-nego.
27窜 1:8 But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought [permission] from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.
27窜 1:9 Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials,
27窜 1:10 and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, "I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king."
27窜 1:11 But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
27窜 1:12 "Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27窜 1:13 "Then let our appearance be observed in your presence, and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see."
27窜 1:14 So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.
27窜 1:15 And at the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king's choice food.
27窜 1:16 So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.
27窜 1:17 And as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every [branch of] literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all [kinds of] visions and dreams.
27窜 1:18 Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.
27窜 1:19 And the king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's personal service.
27窜 1:20 And as for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] conjurers who [were] in all his realm.
27窜 1:21 And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king.
27窜 2:1 Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.
27窜 2:2 Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
27窜 2:3 And the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream."
27窜 2:4 Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic： "O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation."
27窜 2:5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The command from me is firm： if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a rubbish heap.
27窜 2:6 "But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation."
27窜 2:7 They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation."
27窜 2:8 The king answered and said, "I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm,
27窜 2:9 that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation. "
27窜 2:10 The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has [ever] asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean.
27窜 2:11 "Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with [mortal] flesh."
27窜 2:12 Because of this the king became indignant and very furious, and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
27窜 2:13 So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill [them.]
27窜 2:14 Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
27窜 2:15 he answered and said to Arioch, the king's commander, "For what reason is the decree from the king [so] urgent?" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.
27窜 2:16 So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.
27窜 2:17 Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,
27窜 2:18 in order that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
27窜 2:19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;
27窜 2:20 Daniel answered and said, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him.
27窜 2:21 "And it is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men, And knowledge to men of understanding.
27窜 2:22 "It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him.
27窜 2:23 "To Thee, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For Thou hast given me wisdom and power; Even now Thou hast made known to me what we requested of Thee, For Thou hast made known to us the king's matter."
27窜 2:24 Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows： "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king."
27窜 2:25 Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and spoke to him as follows： "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!"
27窜 2:26 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, " Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation? "
27窜 2:27 Daniel answered before the king and said, "As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians, [ nor] diviners are able to declare [it] to the king.
27窜 2:28 "However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind [while] on your bed.
27窜 2:29 "As for you, O king, [while] on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place.
27窜 2:30 "But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than [in] any [other] living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
27窜 2:31 "You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome.
27窜 2:32 "The head of that statue [was made] of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,
27窜 2:33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
27窜 2:34 "You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.
27窜 2:35 "Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
27窜 2:36 "This [was] the dream; now we shall tell its interpretation before the king.
27窜 2:37 "You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory;
27窜 2:38 and wherever the sons of men dwell, [or] the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given [them] into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold.
27窜 2:39 "And after you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.
27窜 2:40 "Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces.
27窜 2:41 "And in that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay.
27窜 2:42 "And [as] the toes of the feet [were] partly of iron and partly of pottery, [so] some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle.
27窜 2:43 "And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery.
27窜 2:44 "And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and [that] kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever.
27窜 2:45 "Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy."
27窜 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense.
27窜 2:47 The king answered Daniel and said, "Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery."
27窜 2:48 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
27窜 2:49 And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel [was] at the king's court.
27窜 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which [ was] sixty cubits [and] its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
27窜 3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent [word] to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
27窜 3:3 Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27窜 3:4 Then the herald loudly proclaimed： "To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and [men of every] language,
27窜 3:5 that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
27窜 3:6 "But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire."
27窜 3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and [men of every] language fell down [and] worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
27窜 3:8 For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.
27窜 3:9 They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king： "O king, live forever!
27窜 3:10 "You yourself, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image.
27窜 3:11 "But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.
27窜 3:12 "There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, [namely] Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up."
27窜 3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king.
27窜 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?
27窜 3:15 "Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, [very well.] But if you will not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?"
27窜 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter.
27窜 3:17 "If it be [so,] our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
27窜 3:18 "But [even] if [He does] not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."
27窜 3:19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.
27窜 3:20 And he commanded certain valiant warriors who [were] in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, in order to cast [them] into the furnace of blazing fire.
27窜 3:21 Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their [other] clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
27窜 3:22 For this reason, because the king's command [was] urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego.
27窜 3:23 But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire [still] tied up.
27窜 3:24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he responded and said to his high officials, "Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?" They answered and said to the king, "Certainly, O king."
27窜 3:25 He answered and said, "Look! I see four men loosed [and] walking [about] in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of [the] gods!"
27窜 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, "Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.
27窜 3:27 And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king's high officials gathered around [and] saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire [even] come upon them.
27窜 3:28 Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king's command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God.
27窜 3:29 "Therefore, I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."
27窜 3:30 Then the king caused Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to prosper in the province of Babylon.
27窜 4:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and [men of every] language that live in all the earth： "May your peace abound!
27窜 4:2 "It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me.
27窜 4:3 "How great are His signs, And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And His dominion is from generation to generation.
27窜 4:4 "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
27窜 4:5 "I saw a dream and it made me fearful; and [these] fantasies [as I lay] on my bed and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
27窜 4:6 "So I gave orders to bring into my presence all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
27窜 4:7 "Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the diviners came in, and I related the dream to them; but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
27窜 4:8 "But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and I related the dream to him, [saying,]
27窜 4:9 'O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery baffles you, tell [me] the visions of my dream which I have seen, along with its interpretation.
27窜 4:10 'Now [these were] the visions in my mind [as I lay] on my bed： I was looking, and behold, [there was] a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height [was] great.
27窜 4:11 'The tree grew large and became strong, And its height reached to the sky, And it [was] visible to the end of the whole earth.
27窜 4:12 'Its foliage [was] beautiful and its fruit abundant, And in it [was] food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, And the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, And all living creatures fed themselves from it.
27窜 4:13 'I was looking in the visions in my mind [as I lay] on my bed, and behold, an [angelic] watcher, a holy one, descended from heaven.
27窜 4:14 'He shouted out and spoke as follows： "Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the beasts flee from under it, And the birds from its branches.
27窜 4:15 "Yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze [around it] In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
27窜 4:16 "Let his mind be changed from [that of] a man, And let a beast's mind be given to him, And let seven periods of time pass over him.
27窜 4:17 "This sentence is by the decree of the [angelic] watchers, And the decision is a command of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, And bestows it on whom He wishes, And sets over it the lowliest of men."
27窜 4:18 'This is the dream [which] I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, tell [me] its interpretation, inasmuch as none of the wise men of my kingdom is able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for a spirit of the holy gods is in you.'
27窜 4:19 "Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while as his thoughts alarmed him. The king responded and said, 'Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.' Belteshazzar answered and said, 'My lord, [if only] the dream applied to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries!
27窜 4:20 'The tree that you saw, which became large and grew strong, whose height reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth,
27窜 4:21 and whose foliage [was] beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which [was] food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and in whose branches the birds of the sky lodged--
27窜 4:22 it is you, O king; for you have become great and grown strong, and your majesty has become great and reached to the sky and your dominion to the end of the earth.
27窜 4:23 'And in that the king saw an [angelic] watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven and saying, "Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and bronze [around it] in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven periods of time pass over him";
27窜 4:24 this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king：
27窜 4:25 that you be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, and bestows it on whomever He wishes.
27窜 4:26 'And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that [it is] Heaven [that] rules.
27窜 4:27 'Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you： break away now from your sins by [doing] righteousness, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to [the] poor, in case there may be a prolonging of your prosperity.'
27窜 4:28 "All [this] happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
27窜 4:29 "Twelve months later he was walking on the [roof of] the royal palace of Babylon.
27窜 4:30 "The king reflected and said, 'Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?'
27窜 4:31 "While the word [was] in the king's mouth, a voice came from heaven, [saying,] 'King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared： sovereignty has been removed from you,
27窜 4:32 and you will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling place [ will be] with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind, and bestows it on whomever He wishes. '
27窜 4:33 "Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until his hair had grown like eagles' [feathers] and his nails like birds' [claws].
27窜 4:34 "But at the end of that period I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever; For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom [endures] from generation to generation.
27窜 4:35 "And all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And [among] the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, 'What hast Thou done?'
27窜 4:36 "At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me.
27窜 4:37 "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise, exalt, and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride."
27窜 5:1 Belshazzar the king held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in the presence of the thousand.
27窜 5:2 When Belshazzar tasted the wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which [was] in Jerusalem, in order that the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
27窜 5:3 Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which [was] in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
27窜 5:4 They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27窜 5:5 Suddenly the fingers of a man's hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing.
27窜 5:6 Then the king's face grew pale, and his thoughts alarmed him; and his hip joints went slack, and his knees began knocking together.
27窜 5:7 The king called aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, "Any man who can read this inscription and explain its interpretation to me will be clothed with purple, and [have] a necklace of gold around his neck, and have authority as third [ruler] in the kingdom."
27窜 5:8 Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or make known its interpretation to the king.
27窜 5:9 Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, his face grew [even] paler, and his nobles were perplexed.
27窜 5:10 The queen entered the banquet hall because of the words of the king and his nobles; the queen spoke and said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face be pale.
27窜 5:11 "There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, illumination, insight, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans, [and] diviners.
27窜 5:12 "[This was] because an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and insight, interpretation of dreams, explanation of enigmas, and solving of difficult problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Let Daniel now be summoned, and he will declare the interpretation."
27窜 5:13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Are you that Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?
27窜 5:14 "Now I have heard about you that a spirit of the gods is in you, and that illumination, insight, and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you.
27窜 5:15 "Just now the wise men [and] the conjurers were brought in before me that they might read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not declare the interpretation of the message.
27窜 5:16 "But I personally have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Now if you are able to read the inscription and make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple and [wear] a necklace of gold around your neck, and you will have authority as the third [ruler] in the kingdom."
27窜 5:17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Keep your gifts for yourself, or give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription to the king and make the interpretation known to him.
27窜 5:18 "O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory, and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father.
27窜 5:19 "And because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations, and [men of every] language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed, and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated, and whomever he wished he humbled.
27窜 5:20 "But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and [his] glory was taken away from him.
27窜 5:21 "He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like [ that of] beasts, and his dwelling place [was] with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he recognized that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind, and [that] He sets over it whomever He wishes.
27窜 5:22 "Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this,
27窜 5:23 but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and your ways, you have not glorified.
27窜 5:24 "Then the hand was sent from Him, and this inscription was written out.
27窜 5:25 "Now this is the inscription that was written out： 'MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.'
27窜 5:26 "This is the interpretation of the message： 'MENE'-- God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.
27窜 5:27 "'TEKEL'-- you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
27窜 5:28 "'PERES'-- your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians."
27窜 5:29 Then Belshazzar gave orders, and they clothed Daniel with purple and [put] a necklace of gold around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he [now] had authority as the third [ruler] in the kingdom.
27窜 5:30 That same night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
27窜 5:31 So Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two.
27窜 6:1 It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, that they should be in charge of the whole kingdom,
27窜 6:2 and over them three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), that these satraps might be accountable to them, and that the king might not suffer loss.
27窜 6:3 Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king planned to appoint him over the entire kingdom.
27窜 6:4 Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or [evidence of] corruption, inasmuch as he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption was [to be] found in him.
27窜 6:5 Then these men said, "We shall not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find [it] against him with regard to the law of his God."
27窜 6:6 Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows： "King Darius, live forever!
27窜 6:7 "All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the high officials and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions' den.
27窜 6:8 "Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."
27窜 6:9 Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.
27窜 6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had been doing previously.
27窜 6:11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
27窜 6:12 Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king's injunction, "Did you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions' den?" The king answered and said, "The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked."
27窜 6:13 Then they answered and spoke before the king, "Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition three times a day."
27窜 6:14 Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed and set [his] mind on delivering Daniel; and even until sunset he kept exerting himself to rescue him.
27窜 6:15 Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, " Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed. "
27窜 6:16 Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and cast into the lions' den. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Your God whom you constantly serve will Himself deliver you."
27窜 6:17 And a stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing might be changed in regard to Daniel.
27窜 6:18 Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
27窜 6:19 Then the king arose with the dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions' den.
27窜 6:20 And when he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?"
27窜 6:21 Then Daniel spoke to the king, "O king, live forever!
27窜 6:22 "My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime."
27窜 6:23 Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
27窜 6:24 The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children, and their wives into the lions' den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
27窜 6:25 Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and [men of every] language who were living in all the land： "May your peace abound!
27窜 6:26 "I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion [will be] forever.
27窜 6:27 "He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has [also] delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27窜 6:28 So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27窜 7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions in his mind [as he lay] on his bed; then he wrote the dream down [and] related the [following] summary of it.
27窜 7:2 Daniel said, "I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
27窜 7:3 "And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another.
27窜 7:4 "The first [was] like a lion and had [the] wings of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was given to it.
27窜 7:5 "And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs [were] in its mouth between its teeth; and thus they said to it, 'Arise, devour much meat!'
27窜 7:6 "After this I kept looking, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
27窜 7:7 "After this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
27窜 7:8 "While I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth uttering great [boasts.]
27窜 7:9 "I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took [His] seat; His vesture [was] like white snow, And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne [was] ablaze with flames, Its wheels [were] a burning fire.
27窜 7:10 "A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened.
27窜 7:11 "Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire.
27窜 7:12 "As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time.
27窜 7:13 "I kept looking in the night visions, And behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a Son of Man was coming, And He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him.
27窜 7:14 "And to Him was given dominion, Glory and a kingdom, That all the peoples, nations, and [men of every] language Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; And His kingdom is one Which will not be destroyed.
27窜 7:15 "As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me, and the visions in my mind kept alarming me.
27窜 7:16 "I approached one of those who were standing by and began asking him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things：
27窜 7:17 'These great beasts, which are four [in number,] are four kings [who] will arise from the earth.
27窜 7:18 'But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.'
27窜 7:19 "Then I desired to know the exact meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its claws of bronze, [and which] devoured, crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet,
27窜 7:20 and [the meaning] of the ten horns that [were] on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three [of them] fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth uttering great [boasts,] and which was larger in appearance than its associates.
27窜 7:21 "I kept looking, and that horn was waging war with the saints and overpowering them
27窜 7:22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived when the saints took possession of the kingdom.
27窜 7:23 "Thus he said： 'The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, which will be different from all the [other] kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and tread it down and crush it.
27窜 7:24 'As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise; and another will arise after them, and he will be different from the previous ones and will subdue three kings.
27窜 7:25 'And he will speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One, and he will intend to make alterations in times and in law; and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
27窜 7:26 'But the court will sit [for judgment,] and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever.
27窜 7:27 'Then the sovereignty, the dominion, and the greatness of [all] the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom [will be] an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.'
27窜 7:28 "At this point the revelation ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my face grew pale, but I kept the matter to myself."
27窜 8:1 In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously.
27窜 8:2 And I looked in the vision, and it came about while I was looking, that I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision, and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal.
27窜 8:3 Then I lifted my gaze and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns [were] long, but one [was] longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last.
27窜 8:4 I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no [other] beasts could stand before him, nor was there anyone to rescue from his power; but he did as he pleased and magnified [himself.]
27窜 8:5 While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat [had] a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
27窜 8:6 And he came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath.
27窜 8:7 And I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power.
27窜 8:8 Then the male goat magnified [himself] exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.
27窜 8:9 And out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful [Land.]
27窜 8:10 And it grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down.
27窜 8:11 It even magnified [itself] to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down.
27窜 8:12 And on account of transgression the host will be given over [to the horn] along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform [its will] and prosper.
27窜 8:13 Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, "How long will the vision [about] the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?"
27窜 8:14 And he said to me, "For 23000 evenings [and] mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored."
27窜 8:15 And it came about when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man.
27窜 8:16 And I heard the voice of a man between [the banks of] Ulai, and he called out and said, "Gabriel, give this [man] an understanding of the vision."
27窜 8:17 So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end."
27窜 8:18 Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright.
27窜 8:19 And he said, "Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for [it] pertains to the appointed time of the end.
27窜 8:20 "The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.
27窜 8:21 "And the shaggy goat [represents] the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
27窜 8:22 "And the broken [horn] and the four [horns that] arose in its place [represent] four kingdoms [which] will arise from [his] nation, although not with his power.
27窜 8:23 "And in the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run [their course,] A king will arise Insolent and skilled in intrigue.
27窜 8:24 "And his power will be mighty, but not by his [own] power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform [his will;] He will destroy mighty men and the holy people.
27窜 8:25 "And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify [himself] in his heart, And he will destroy many while [they are] at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency.
27窜 8:26 "And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For [it] pertains to many days [in the future.]"
27窜 8:27 Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up [again] and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain [it.]
27窜 9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans--
27窜 9:2 in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, observed in the books the number of the years which was [revealed as] the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem, [namely,] seventy years.
27窜 9:3 So I gave my attention to the Lord God to seek [Him by] prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
27窜 9:4 And I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed and said, "Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,
27窜 9:5 we have sinned, committed iniquity, acted wickedly, and rebelled, even turning aside from Thy commandments and ordinances.
27窜 9:6 "Moreover, we have not listened to Thy servants the prophets, who spoke in Thy name to our kings, our princes, our fathers, and all the people of the land.
27窜 9:7 "Righteousness belongs to Thee, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day-- to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which Thou hast driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against Thee.
27窜 9:8 "Open shame belongs to us, O Lord, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee.
27窜 9:9 "To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him;
27窜 9:10 nor have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
27窜 9:11 "Indeed all Israel has transgressed Thy law and turned aside, not obeying Thy voice; so the curse has been poured out on us, along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against Him.
27窜 9:12 "Thus He has confirmed His words which He had spoken against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring on us great calamity; for under the whole heaven there has not been done [anything] like what was done to Jerusalem.
27窜 9:13 "As it is written in the law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquity and giving attention to Thy truth.
27窜 9:14 "Therefore, the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.
27窜 9:15 "And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought Thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and hast made a name for Thyself, as it is this day-- we have sinned, we have been wicked.
27窜 9:16 "O Lord, in accordance with all Thy righteous acts, let now Thine anger and Thy wrath turn away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people [have become] a reproach to all those around us.
27窜 9:17 "So now, our God, listen to the prayer of Thy servant and to his supplications, and for Thy sake, O Lord, let Thy face shine on Thy desolate sanctuary.
27窜 9:18 "O my God, incline Thine ear and hear! Open Thine eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Thy name; for we are not presenting our supplications before Thee on account of any merits of our own, but on account of Thy great compassion.
27窜 9:19 "O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and take action! For Thine own sake, O my God, do not delay, because Thy city and Thy people are called by Thy name."
27窜 9:20 Now while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God in behalf of the holy mountain of my God,
27窜 9:21 while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in [my] extreme weariness about the time of the evening offering.
27窜 9:22 And he gave [me] instruction and talked with me, and said, "O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you insight with understanding.
27窜 9:23 "At the beginning of your supplications the command was issued, and I have come to tell [you,] for you are highly esteemed; so give heed to the message and gain understanding of the vision.
27窜 9:24 "Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy [place.]
27窜 9:25 "So you are to know and discern [that] from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince [there will be] seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress.
27窜 9:26 "Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end [will come] with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.
27窜 9:27 "And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations [will come] one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate."
27窜 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar; and the message was true and [one of] great conflict, but he understood the message and had an understanding of the vision.
27窜 10:2 In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning for three entire weeks.
27窜 10:3 I did not eat any tasty food, nor did meat or wine enter my mouth, nor did I use any ointment at all, until the entire three weeks were completed.
27窜 10:4 And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was by the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,
27窜 10:5 I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was girded with [a belt of] pure gold of Uphaz.
27窜 10:6 His body also was like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a tumult.
27窜 10:7 Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves.
27窜 10:8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a deathly pallor, and I retained no strength.
27窜 10:9 But I heard the sound of his words; and as soon as I heard the sound of his words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.
27窜 10:10 Then behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
27窜 10:11 And he said to me, "O Daniel, man of high esteem, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
27窜 10:12 Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding [this] and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words.
27窜 10:13 "But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
27窜 10:14 "Now I have come to give you an understanding of what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision pertains to the days yet [ future.]"
27窜 10:15 And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless.
27窜 10:16 And behold, one who resembled a human being was touching my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, and said to him who was standing before me, "O my lord, as a result of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have retained no strength.
27窜 10:17 "For how can such a servant of my lord talk with such as my lord? As for me, there remains just now no strength in me, nor has any breath been left in me."
27窜 10:18 Then [this] one with human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.
27窜 10:19 And he said, "O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!" Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, "May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
27窜 10:20 Then he said, "Do you understand why I came to you? But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.
27窜 10:21 "However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these [forces] except Michael your prince.
27窜 11:1 "And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him.
27窜 11:2 "And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all [ of them;] as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole [empire] against the realm of Greece.
27窜 11:3 "And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases.
27窜 11:4 "But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his [own] descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded; for his sovereignty will be uprooted and [given] to others besides them.
27窜 11:5 "Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with [one] of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain [will be] a great dominion [indeed].
27窜 11:6 "And after some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in, and the one who sired her, as well as he who supported her in [those] times.
27窜 11:7 "But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against [their] army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display [great] strength.
27窜 11:8 "And also their gods with their metal images [and] their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from [attacking] the king of the North for [some] years.
27窜 11:9 "Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his [own] land.
27窜 11:10 "And his sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his [very] fortress.
27窜 11:11 "And the king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but [that] multitude will be given into the hand of the [former].
27窜 11:12 "When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail.
27窜 11:13 "For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment.
27窜 11:14 "Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down.
27窜 11:15 "Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege mound, and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand [their ground,] not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand.
27窜 11:16 "But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will [be able to] withstand him; he will also stay [for a time] in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand.
27窜 11:17 "And he will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand [for him] or be on his side.
27窜 11:18 "Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn.
27窜 11:19 "So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more.
27窜 11:20 "Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of [his] kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though neither in anger nor in battle.
27窜 11:21 "And in his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue.
27窜 11:22 "And the overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant.
27窜 11:23 "And after an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small [force of] people.
27窜 11:24 "In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest [parts] of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty, and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but [only] for a time.
27窜 11:25 "And he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him.
27窜 11:26 "And those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain.
27窜 11:27 "As for both kings, their hearts will be [intent] on evil, and they will speak lies [to each other] at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still [to come] at the appointed time.
27窜 11:28 "Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be [set] against the holy covenant, and he will take action and [then] return to his [own] land.
27窜 11:29 "At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before.
27窜 11:30 "For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened, and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant.
27窜 11:31 "And forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation.
27窜 11:32 "And by smooth [words] he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action.
27窜 11:33 "And those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder, for [many] days.
27窜 11:34 "Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy.
27窜 11:35 "And some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge, and make them pure, until the end time; because [it is] still [to come] at the appointed time.
27窜 11:36 "Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done.
27窜 11:37 "And he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any [other] god; for he will magnify himself above [them] all.
27窜 11:38 "But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor [him] with gold, silver, costly stones, and treasures.
27窜 11:39 "And he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with [ the help of] a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge [him,] and he will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price.
27窜 11:40 "And at the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow [them,] and pass through.
27窜 11:41 "He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many [countries] will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand： Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon.
27窜 11:42 "Then he will stretch out his hand against [other] countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.
27窜 11:43 "But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians [will follow] at his heels.
27窜 11:44 "But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many.
27窜 11:45 "And he will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
27窜 12:1 "Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands [guard] over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued.
27窜 12:2 "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace [and] everlasting contempt.
27窜 12:3 "And those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
27窜 12:4 "But as for you, Daniel, conceal these words and seal up the book until the end of time; many will go back and forth, and knowledge will increase."
27窜 12:5 Then I, Daniel, looked and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river, and the other on that bank of the river.
27窜 12:6 And one said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, "How long [will it be] until the end of [these] wonders?"
27窜 12:7 And I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, as he raised his right hand and his left toward heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half [ a time;] and as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people, all these [events] will be completed.
27窜 12:8 As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, "My lord, what [will be] the outcome of these [events?]"
27窜 12:9 And he said, "Go [your way,] Daniel, for [these] words are concealed and sealed up until the end time.
27窜 12:10 "Many will be purged, purified and refined; but the wicked will act wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.
27窜 12:11 "And from the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished, and the abomination of desolation is set up, [there will be] 12900 days.
27窜 12:12 "How blessed is he who keeps waiting and attains to the 13355 days!
27窜 12:13 "But as for you, go [your way] to the end; then you will enter into rest and rise [again] for your allotted portion at the end of the age."

28龋 1:1 The word of the LORD which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
28龋 1:2 When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, "Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry, and [have] children of harlotry; for the land commits flagrant harlotry, forsaking the LORD."
28龋 1:3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
28龋 1:4 And the LORD said to him, "Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
28龋 1:5 "And it will come about on that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
28龋 1:6 Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to him, "Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I should ever forgive them.
28龋 1:7 "But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen."
28龋 1:8 When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.
28龋 1:9 And the LORD said, "Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not your God."
28龋 1:10 Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And it will come about that, in the place Where it is said to them, "You are not My people," It will be said to them, "[You are] the sons of the living God."
28龋 1:11 And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, And they will appoint for themselves one leader, And they will go up from the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel.
28龋 2:1 Say to your brothers, "Ammi," and to your sisters, "Ruhamah."
28龋 2:2 "Contend with your mother, contend, For she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; And let her put away her harlotry from her face, And her adultery from between her breasts,
28龋 2:3 Lest I strip her naked And expose her as on the day when she was born. I will also make her like a wilderness, Make her like desert land, And slay her with thirst.
28龋 2:4 "Also, I will have no compassion on her children, Because they are children of harlotry.
28龋 2:5 "For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has acted shamefully. For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, Who give [me] my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'
28龋 2:6 "Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.
28龋 2:7 "And she will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; And she will seek them, but will not find [them.] Then she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband, For it was better for me then than now!'
28龋 2:8 "For she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, And lavished on her silver and gold, [Which] they used for Baal.
28龋 2:9 "Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time And My new wine in its season. I will also take away My wool and My flax [Given] to cover her nakedness.
28龋 2:10 "And then I will uncover her lewdness In the sight of her lovers, And no one will rescue her out of My hand.
28龋 2:11 "I will also put an end to all her gaiety, Her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths, And all her festal assemblies.
28龋 2:12 "And I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, 'These are my wages Which my lovers have given me.' And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them.
28龋 2:13 "And I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me," declares the LORD.
28龋 2:14 "Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Bring her into the wilderness, And speak kindly to her.
28龋 2:15 "Then I will give her her vineyards from there, And the valley of Achor as a door of hope. And she will sing there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.
28龋 2:16 "And it will come about in that day," declares the LORD, "That you will call Me Ishi And will no longer call Me Baali.
28龋 2:17 "For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will be mentioned by their names no more.
28龋 2:18 "In that day I will also make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, The birds of the sky, And the creeping things of the ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land, And will make them lie down in safety.
28龋 2:19 "And I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice, In lovingkindness and in compassion,
28龋 2:20 And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness. Then you will know the LORD.
28龋 2:21 "And it will come about in that day that I will respond," declares the LORD. I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth,
28龋 2:22 And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine, and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel.
28龋 2:23 "And I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And they will say, '[Thou art] my God!'"
28龋 3:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman [who] is loved by [her] husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
28龋 3:2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen [shekels] of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
28龋 3:3 Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you."
28龋 3:4 For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or [sacred] pillar, and without ephod or household idols.
28龋 3:5 Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
28龋 4:1 Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land.
28龋 4:2 [There is] swearing, deception, murder, stealing, and adultery. They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.
28龋 4:3 Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives in it languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky; And also the fish of the sea disappear.
28龋 4:4 Yet let no one find fault, and let none offer reproof; For your people are like those who contend with the priest.
28龋 4:5 So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother.
28龋 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
28龋 4:7 The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
28龋 4:8 They feed on the sin of My people, And direct their desire toward their iniquity.
28龋 4:9 And it will be, like people, like priest; So I will punish them for their ways, And repay them for their deeds.
28龋 4:10 And they will eat, but not have enough; They will play the harlot, but not increase, Because they have stopped giving heed to the LORD.
28龋 4:11 Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the understanding.
28龋 4:12 My people consult their wooden idol, and their [diviner's] wand informs them; For a spirit of harlotry has led [them] astray, And they have played the harlot, [departing] from their God.
28龋 4:13 They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains And burn incense on the hills, Under oak, poplar, and terebinth, Because their shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters play the harlot, And your brides commit adultery.
28龋 4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot Or your brides when they commit adultery, For [the men] themselves go apart with harlots And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes; So the people without understanding are ruined.
28龋 4:15 Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Do not let Judah become guilty; Also do not go to Gilgal, Or go up to Beth-aven, And take the oath： " As the LORD lives! "
28龋 4:16 Since Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn heifer, Can the LORD now pasture them Like a lamb in a large field?
28龋 4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.
28龋 4:18 Their liquor gone, They play the harlot continually; Their rulers dearly love shame.
28龋 4:19 The wind wraps them in its wings, And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
28龋 5:1 Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! For the judgment applies to you, For you have been a snare at Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor.
28龋 5:2 And the revolters have gone deep in depravity, But I will chastise all of them.
28龋 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you have played the harlot, Israel has defiled itself.
28龋 5:4 Their deeds will not allow them To return to their God. For a spirit of harlotry is within them, And they do not know the LORD.
28龋 5:5 Moreover, the pride of Israel testifies against him, And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also has stumbled with them.
28龋 5:6 They will go with their flocks and herds To seek the LORD, but they will not find [Him]; He has withdrawn from them.
28龋 5:7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their land.
28龋 5:8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah. Sound an alarm at Beth-aven： "Behind you, Benjamin!"
28龋 5:9 Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is sure.
28龋 5:10 The princes of Judah have become like those who move a boundary; On them I will pour out My wrath like water.
28龋 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, Because he was determined to follow [man's] command.
28龋 5:12 Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim, And like rottenness to the house of Judah.
28龋 5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb. But he is unable to heal you, Or to cure you of your wound.
28龋 5:14 For I [will be] like a lion to Ephraim, And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear to pieces and go away, I will carry away, and there will be none to deliver.
28龋 5:15 I will go away [and] return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.
28龋 6:1 "Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn [us,] but He will heal us; He has wounded [us,] but He will bandage us.
28龋 6:2 "He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day That we may live before Him.
28龋 6:3 "So let us know, let us press on to know the LORD. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like the spring rain watering the earth."
28龋 6:4 What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud, And like the dew which goes away early.
28龋 6:5 Therefore I have hewn [them] in pieces by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And the judgments on you are [like] the light that goes forth.
28龋 6:6 For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
28龋 6:7 But like Adam they have transgressed the covenant; There they have dealt treacherously against Me.
28龋 6:8 Gilead is a city of wrongdoers, Tracked with bloody [footprints.]
28龋 6:9 And as raiders wait for a man, [So] a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they have committed crime.
28龋 6:10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; Ephraim's harlotry is there, Israel has defiled itself.
28龋 6:11 Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, When I restore the fortunes of My people.
28龋 7:1 When I would heal Israel, The iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, And the evil deeds of Samaria, For they deal falsely; The thief enters in, Bandits raid outside,
28龋 7:2 And they do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds are all around them; They are before My face.
28龋 7:3 With their wickedness they make the king glad, And the princes with their lies.
28龋 7:4 They are all adulterers Like an oven heated by the baker, Who ceases to stir up [the fire] From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
28龋 7:5 On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers,
28龋 7:6 For their hearts are like an oven [As] they approach their plotting; Their anger smolders all night, In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
28龋 7:7 All of them are hot like an oven, And they consume their rulers; All their kings have fallen. None of them calls on Me.
28龋 7:8 Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim has become a cake not turned.
28龋 7:9 Strangers devour his strength, Yet he does not know [it]; Gray hairs also are sprinkled on him, Yet he does not know [it.]
28龋 7:10 Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet they have neither returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all this.
28龋 7:11 So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.
28龋 7:12 When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance with the proclamation to their assembly.
28龋 7:13 Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against Me.
28龋 7:14 And they do not cry to Me from their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me.
28龋 7:15 Although I trained [and] strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me.
28龋 7:16 They turn, [but] not upward, They are like a deceitful bow; Their princes will fall by the sword Because of the insolence of their tongue. This [will be] their derision in the land of Egypt.
28龋 8:1 [Put] the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle [the enemy comes] against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant, And rebelled against My law.
28龋 8:2 They cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know Thee!"
28龋 8:3 Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him.
28龋 8:4 They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know [it.] With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off.
28龋 8:5 He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, saying, "My anger burns against them!" How long will they be incapable of innocence?
28龋 8:6 For from Israel is even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.
28龋 8:7 For they sow the wind, And they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up.
28龋 8:8 Israel is swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights.
28龋 8:9 For they have gone up to Assyria, [Like] a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers.
28龋 8:10 Even though they hire [allies] among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of princes.
28龋 8:11 Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him.
28龋 8:12 Though I wrote for him ten thousand [precepts] of My law, They are regarded as a strange thing.
28龋 8:13 As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat [it,] [ But] the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their iniquity, And punish [them] for their sins; They will return to Egypt.
28龋 8:14 For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings.
28龋 9:1 Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved [harlots '] earnings on every threshing floor.
28龋 9:2 Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them.
28龋 9:3 They will not remain in the Lord's land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean [food.]
28龋 9:4 They will not pour out libations of wine to the LORD, Their sacrifices will not please Him. [Their bread will be] like mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves [alone]; It will not enter the house of the LORD.
28龋 9:5 What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD?
28龋 9:6 For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns [will be] in their tents.
28龋 9:7 The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know [this]! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And [because] your hostility is [so] great.
28龋 9:8 Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God, a prophet; [Yet] the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, [And] there is [only] hostility in the house of his God.
28龋 9:9 They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.
28龋 9:10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first [season.] [But] they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved.
28龋 9:11 As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!
28龋 9:12 Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them!
28龋 9:13 Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.
28龋 9:14 Give them, O LORD-- what wilt Thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
28龋 9:15 All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels.
28龋 9:16 Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb.
28龋 9:17 My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations.
28龋 10:1 Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The richer his land, The better he made the [sacred] pillars.
28龋 10:2 Their heart is faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars [And] destroy their [sacred] pillars.
28龋 10:3 Surely now they will say, "We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?"
28龋 10:4 They speak [mere] words, With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
28龋 10:5 The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it.
28龋 10:6 The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame, And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel.
28龋 10:7 Samaria will be cut off [with] her king, Like a stick on the surface of the water.
28龋 10:8 Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars, Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!"
28龋 10:9 From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah?
28龋 10:10 When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt.
28龋 10:11 And Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck [with a yoke]; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself.
28龋 10:12 Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you.
28龋 10:13 You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors,
28龋 10:14 Therefore, a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, [When] mothers were dashed in pieces with [their] children.
28龋 10:15 Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
28龋 11:1 When Israel [was] a youth I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.
28龋 11:2 The more they called them, The more they went from them; They kept sacrificing to the Baals And burning incense to idols.
28龋 11:3 Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them in My arms; But they did not know that I healed them.
28龋 11:4 I led them with cords of a man, with bonds of love, And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws; And I bent down [and] fed them.
28龋 11:5 They will not return to the land of Egypt; But Assyria-- he will be their king, Because they refused to return [to Me.]
28龋 11:6 And the sword will whirl against their cities, And will demolish their gate bars And consume [them] because of their counsels.
28龋 11:7 So My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call them to [ the One] on high, None at all exalts [Him.]
28龋 11:8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned over within Me, All My compassions are kindled.
28龋 11:9 I will not execute My fierce anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man, the Holy One in your midst, And I will not come in wrath.
28龋 11:10 They will walk after the LORD, He will roar like a lion; Indeed He will roar, And [His] sons will come trembling from the west.
28龋 11:11 They will come trembling like birds from Egypt, And like doves from the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses, declares the LORD.
28龋 11:12 Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; Judah is also unruly against God, Even against the Holy One who is faithful.
28龋 12:1 Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt.
28龋 12:2 The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.
28龋 12:3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God.
28龋 12:4 Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel, And there He spoke with us,
28龋 12:5 Even the LORD, the God of hosts; The LORD is His name.
28龋 12:6 Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually.
28龋 12:7 A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress.
28龋 12:8 And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which [would be] sin."
28龋 12:9 But I [have been] the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival.
28龋 12:10 I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions; And through the prophets I gave parables.
28龋 12:11 Is there iniquity [in] Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field.
28龋 12:12 Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept [sheep.]
28龋 12:13 But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept.
28龋 12:14 Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him, And bring back his reproach to him.
28龋 13:1 When Ephraim spoke, [there was] trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, But through Baal he did wrong and died.
28龋 13:2 And now they sin more and more, And make for themselves molten images, Idols skillfully made from their silver, All of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, "Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!"
28龋 13:3 Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud, And like dew which soon disappears, Like chaff which is blown away from the threshing floor, And like smoke from a chimney.
28龋 13:4 Yet I [have been] the LORD your God Since the land of Egypt; And you were not to know any god except Me, For there is no savior besides Me.
28龋 13:5 I cared for you in the wilderness, In the land of drought.
28龋 13:6 As [they had] their pasture, they became satisfied, And being satisfied, their heart became proud; Therefore, they forgot Me.
28龋 13:7 So I will be like a lion to them; Like a leopard I will lie in wait by the wayside.
28龋 13:8 I will encounter them like a bear robbed of her cubs, And I will tear open their chests; There I will also devour them like a lioness, [As] a wild beast would tear them.
28龋 13:9 [It is] your destruction, O Israel, That [you are] against Me, against your help.
28龋 13:10 Where now is your king That he may save you in all your cities, And your judges of whom you requested, "Give me a king and princes"?
28龋 13:11 I gave you a king in My anger, And took him away in My wrath.
28龋 13:12 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; His sin is stored up.
28龋 13:13 The pains of childbirth come upon him; He is not a wise son, For it is not the time that he should delay at the opening of the womb.
28龋 13:14 Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from death? O Death, where are your thorns? O Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion will be hidden from My sight.
28龋 13:15 Though he flourishes among the reeds, An east wind will come, The wind of the LORD coming up from the wilderness; And his fountain will become dry, And his spring will be dried up; It will plunder [his] treasury of every precious article.
28龋 13:16 Samaria will be held guilty, For she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword, Their little ones will be dashed in pieces, And their pregnant women will be ripped open.
28龋 14:1 Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity.
28龋 14:2 Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him, "Take away all iniquity, And receive [us] graciously, That we may present the fruit of our lips.
28龋 14:3 "Assyria will not save us, We will not ride on horses; Nor will we say again, 'Our god,' To the work of our hands; For in Thee the orphan finds mercy."
28龋 14:4 I will heal their apostasy, I will love them freely, For My anger has turned away from them.
28龋 14:5 I will be like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily, And he will take root like [the cedars of] Lebanon.
28龋 14:6 His shoots will sprout, And his beauty will be like the olive tree, And his fragrance like [the cedars of] Lebanon.
28龋 14:7 Those who live in his shadow Will again raise grain, And they will blossom like the vine. His renown [will be] like the wine of Lebanon.
28龋 14:8 O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; From Me comes your fruit.
28龋 14:9 Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; [Whoever] is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the righteous will walk in them, But transgressors will stumble in them.

29跨 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.
29跨 1:2 Hear this, O elders, And listen, all inhabitants of the land. Has [ anything like] this happened in your days Or in your fathers' days?
29跨 1:3 Tell your sons about it, And [let] your sons [tell] their sons, And their sons the next generation.
29跨 1:4 What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten; And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.
29跨 1:5 Awake, drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you wine drinkers, On account of the sweet wine That is cut off from your mouth.
29跨 1:6 For a nation has invaded my land, Mighty and without number; Its teeth are the teeth of a lion, And it has the fangs of a lioness.
29跨 1:7 It has made my vine a waste, And my fig tree splinters. It has stripped them bare and cast [them] away; Their branches have become white.
29跨 1:8 Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the bridegroom of her youth.
29跨 1:9 The grain offering and the libation are cut off From the house of the LORD. The priests mourn, The ministers of the LORD.
29跨 1:10 The field is ruined, The land mourns, For the grain is ruined, The new wine dries up, Fresh oil fails.
29跨 1:11 Be ashamed, O farmers, Wail, O vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.
29跨 1:12 The vine dries up, And the fig tree fails; The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree, All the trees of the field dry up. Indeed, rejoicing dries up From the sons of men.
29跨 1:13 Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], And lament, O priests; Wail, O ministers of the altar! Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, For the grain offering and the libation Are withheld from the house of your God.
29跨 1:14 Consecrate a fast, Proclaim a solemn assembly; Gather the elders [And] all the inhabitants of the land To the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD.
29跨 1:15 Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is near, And it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
29跨 1:16 Has not food been cut off before our eyes, Gladness and joy from the house of our God?
29跨 1:17 The seeds shrivel under their clods; The storehouses are desolate, The barns are torn down, For the grain is dried up.
29跨 1:18 How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle wander aimlessly Because there is no pasture for them; Even the flocks of sheep suffer.
29跨 1:19 To Thee, O LORD, I cry; For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.
29跨 1:20 Even the beasts of the field pant for Thee; For the water brooks are dried up, And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
29跨 2:1 Blow a trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, For the day of the LORD is coming; Surely it is near,
29跨 2:2 A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness. As the dawn is spread over the mountains, [So] there is a great and mighty people; There has never been [anything] like it, Nor will there be again after it To the years of many generations.
29跨 2:3 A fire consumes before them, And behind them a flame burns. The land is like the garden of Eden before them, But a desolate wilderness behind them, And nothing at all escapes them.
29跨 2:4 Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; And like war horses, so they run.
29跨 2:5 With a noise as of chariots They leap on the tops of the mountains, Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, Like a mighty people arranged for battle.
29跨 2:6 Before them the people are in anguish; All faces turn pale.
29跨 2:7 They run like mighty men; They climb the wall like soldiers; And they each march in line, Nor do they deviate from their paths.
29跨 2:8 They do not crowd each other; They march everyone in his path. When they burst through the defenses, They do not break ranks.
29跨 2:9 They rush on the city, They run on the wall; They climb into the houses, They enter through the windows like a thief.
29跨 2:10 Before them the earth quakes, The heavens tremble, The sun and the moon grow dark, And the stars lose their brightness.
29跨 2:11 And the LORD utters His voice before His army; Surely His camp is very great, For strong is he who carries out His word. The day of the LORD is indeed great and very awesome, And who can endure it?
29跨 2:12 "Yet even now," declares the LORD, "Return to Me with all your heart, And with fasting, weeping, and mourning;
29跨 2:13 And rend your heart and not your garments. "Now return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness, And relenting of evil.
29跨 2:14 Who knows whether He will [not] turn and relent, And leave a blessing behind Him, [Even] a grain offering and a libation For the LORD your God?
29跨 2:15 Blow a trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly,
29跨 2:16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and the nursing infants. Let the bridegroom come out of his room And the bride out of her [bridal] chamber.
29跨 2:17 Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say, "Spare Thy people, O LORD, And do not make Thine inheritance a reproach, A byword among the nations. Why should they among the peoples say, 'Where is their God?'"
29跨 2:18 Then the LORD will be zealous for His land, And will have pity on His people.
29跨 2:19 And the LORD will answer and say to His people, "Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine, and oil, And you will be satisfied [in full] with them; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations.
29跨 2:20 "But I will remove the northern [army] far from you, And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land, And its vanguard into the eastern sea, And its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will arise and its foul smell will come up, For it has done great things."
29跨 2:21 Do not fear, O land, rejoice and be glad, For the LORD has done great things.
29跨 2:22 Do not fear, beasts of the field, For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green, For the tree has borne its fruit, The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full.
29跨 2:23 So rejoice, O sons of Zion, And be glad in the LORD your God; For He has given you the early rain for [your] vindication. And He has poured down for you the rain, The early and latter rain as before.
29跨 2:24 And the threshing floors will be full of grain, And the vats will overflow with the new wine and oil.
29跨 2:25 "Then I will make up to you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten, The creeping locust, the stripping locust, and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you.
29跨 2:26 "And you shall have plenty to eat and be satisfied, And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; Then My people will never be put to shame.
29跨 2:27 "Thus you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God And there is no other; And My people will never be put to shame.
29跨 2:28 "And it will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions.
29跨 2:29 "And even on the male and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
29跨 2:30 "And I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth, Blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
29跨 2:31 "The sun will be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.
29跨 2:32 "And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the LORD Will be delivered; For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be those who escape, As the LORD has said, Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls.
29跨 3:1 "For behold, in those days and at that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
29跨 3:2 I will gather all the nations, And bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; And they have divided up My land.
29跨 3:3 "They have also cast lots for My people, Traded a boy for a harlot, And sold a girl for wine that they may drink.
29跨 3:4 "Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? But if you do recompense Me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense on your head.
29跨 3:5 "Since you have taken My silver and My gold, brought My precious treasures to your temples,
29跨 3:6 and sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their territory,
29跨 3:7 behold, I am going to arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and return your recompense on your head.
29跨 3:8 "Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken.
29跨 3:9 Proclaim this among the nations： Prepare a war; rouse the mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up!
29跨 3:10 Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, "I am a mighty man."
29跨 3:11 Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, O LORD, Thy mighty ones.
29跨 3:12 Let the nations be aroused And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations.
29跨 3:13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the wine press is full; The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
29跨 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
29跨 3:15 The sun and moon grow dark, And the stars lose their brightness.
29跨 3:16 And the LORD roars from Zion And utters His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth tremble. But the LORD is a refuge for His people And a stronghold to the sons of Israel.
29跨 3:17 Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain. So Jerusalem will be holy, And strangers will pass through it no more.
29跨 3:18 And it will come about in that day That the mountains will drip with sweet wine, And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD, To water the valley of Shittim.
29跨 3:19 Egypt will become a waste, And Edom will become a desolate wilderness, Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, In whose land they have shed innocent blood.
29跨 3:20 But Judah will be inhabited forever, And Jerusalem for all generations.
29跨 3:21 And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged, For the LORD dwells in Zion.

30鞠 1:11 Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of Edom and for four I will not revoke its [punishment], Because he pursued his brother with the sword, While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore continually, And he maintained his fury forever.
30鞠 1:12 "So I will send fire upon Teman, And it will consume the citadels of Bozrah."
30鞠 1:13 Thus says the LORD, "For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its [punishment], Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their borders.

30鞠 3:4 Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured [something]?
30鞠 3:5 Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all?

30鞠 3:11 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "An enemy, even one surrounding the land, Will pull down your strength from you And your citadels will be looted."
30鞠 3:12 Thus says the LORD, "Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion's mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria be snatched away-- With [the] corner of a bed and [the] cover of a couch!
30鞠 3:13 "Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Declares the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.

30鞠 4:9 "I smote you with scorching [wind] and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
30鞠 4:10 "I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
30鞠 4:11 "I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me," declares the LORD.
30鞠 4:12 "Therefore, thus I will do to you, O Israel; Because I shall do this to you, Prepare to meet your God, O Israel."
30鞠 4:13 For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind And declares to man what are His thoughts, He who makes dawn into darkness And treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD God of hosts is His name.
30鞠 5:1 Hear this word which I take up for you as a dirge, O house of Israel.
30鞠 5:2 She has fallen, she will not rise again-- The virgin Israel. She [lies] neglected on her land; There is none to raise her up.
30鞠 5:3 For thus says the Lord GOD, "The city which goes forth a thousand [ strong] Will have a hundred left, And the one which goes forth a hundred [ strong] Will have ten left to the house of Israel."
30鞠 5:4 For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel, "Seek Me that you may live.
30鞠 5:5 "But do not resort to Bethel, And do not come to Gilgal, Nor cross over to Beersheba; For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity, And Bethel will come to trouble.
30鞠 5:6 "Seek the LORD that you may live, Lest He break forth like a fire, O house of Joseph, And it consume with none to quench [it] for Bethel,
30鞠 5:7 [For] those who turn justice into wormwood And cast righteousness down to the earth. "
30鞠 5:8 He who made the Pleiades and Orion And changes deep darkness into morning, Who also darkens day [into] night, Who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the surface of the earth, The LORD is His name.
30鞠 5:9 It is He who flashes forth [with] destruction upon the strong, So that destruction comes upon the fortress.
30鞠 5:10 They hate him who reproves in the gate, And they abhor him who speaks [with] integrity.
30鞠 5:11 Therefore, because you impose heavy rent on the poor And exact a tribute of grain from them, [Though] you have built houses of well-hewn stone, Yet you will not live in them; You have planted pleasant vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine.
30鞠 5:12 For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are great, [You] who distress the righteous [and] accept bribes, And turn aside the poor in the gate.
30鞠 5:13 Therefore, at such a time the prudent person keeps silent, for it is an evil time.
30鞠 5:14 Seek good and not evil, that you may live; And thus may the LORD God of hosts be with you, Just as you have said!
30鞠 5:15 Hate evil, love good, And establish justice in the gate! Perhaps the LORD God of hosts May be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
30鞠 5:16 Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts, the Lord, "There is wailing in all the plazas, And in all the streets they say, 'Alas! Alas!' They also call the farmer to mourning And professional mourners to lamentation.
30鞠 5:17 "And in all the vineyards [there is] wailing, Because I shall pass through the midst of you," says the LORD.
30鞠 5:18 Alas, you who are longing for the day of the LORD, For what purpose [will] the day of the LORD [be] to you? It [will be] darkness and not light;
30鞠 5:19 As when a man flees from a lion, And a bear meets him, Or goes home, leans his hand against the wall, And a snake bites him.
30鞠 5:20 [Will] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness instead of light, Even gloom with no brightness in it?
30鞠 5:21 "I hate, I reject your festivals, Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies.
30鞠 5:22 "Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not accept [them]; And I will not [even] look at the peace offerings of your fatlings.
30鞠 5:23 "Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.
30鞠 5:24 "But let justice roll down like waters And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
30鞠 5:25 "Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?
30鞠 5:26 "You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.
30鞠 5:27 "Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.
30鞠 6:1 Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, And to those who [feel] secure in the mountain of Samaria, The distinguished men of the foremost of nations, To whom the house of Israel comes.
30鞠 6:2 Go over to Calneh and look, And go from there to Hamath the great, Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, Or is their territory greater than yours?
30鞠 6:3 Do you put off the day of calamity, And would you bring near the seat of violence?
30鞠 6:4 Those who recline on beds of ivory And sprawl on their couches, And eat lambs from the flock And calves from the midst of the stall,
30鞠 6:5 Who improvise to the sound of the harp, [And] like David have composed songs for themselves,
30鞠 6:6 Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls While they anoint themselves with the finest of oils, Yet they have not grieved over the ruin of Joseph.
30鞠 6:7 Therefore, they will now go into exile at the head of the exiles, And the sprawlers' banqueting will pass away.
30鞠 6:8 The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself, the LORD God of hosts has declared： "I loathe the arrogance of Jacob, And I detest his citadels; Therefore, I will deliver up [the] city and all it contains."
30鞠 6:9 And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die.
30鞠 6:10 Then one's uncle, or his undertaker, will lift him up to carry out [ his] bones from the house, and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part of the house, "Is anyone else with you?" And that one will say, "No one." Then he will answer, "Keep quiet. For the name of the LORD is not to be mentioned."
30鞠 6:11 For behold, the LORD is going to command that the great house be smashed to pieces and the small house to fragments.
30鞠 6:12 Do horses run on rocks? Or does one plow them with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison, And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
30鞠 6:13 You who rejoice in Lo-debar, And say, "Have we not by our [own] strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?"
30鞠 6:14 "For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel," declares the LORD God of hosts, "And they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath To the brook of the Arabah."
30鞠 7:1 Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, He was forming a locust-swarm when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop [was] after the king's mowing.
30鞠 7:2 And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said, "Lord GOD, please pardon! How can Jacob stand, For he is small?"
30鞠 7:3 The LORD changed His mind about this. "It shall not be," said the LORD .
30鞠 7:4 Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, the Lord GOD was calling to contend [with them] by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farm land.
30鞠 7:5 Then I said, "Lord GOD, please stop! How can Jacob stand, for he is small?"
30鞠 7:6 The LORD changed His mind about this. "This too shall not be," said the Lord GOD.
30鞠 7:7 Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall, with a plumb line in His hand.
30鞠 7:8 And the LORD said to me, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "Behold I am about to put a plumb line In the midst of My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.
30鞠 7:9 "The high places of Isaac will be desolated And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste. Then shall I rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword."
30鞠 7:10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent [word] to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words.
30鞠 7:11 "For thus Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'"
30鞠 7:12 Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, flee away to the land of Judah, and there eat bread and there do your prophesying!
30鞠 7:13 "But no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence."
30鞠 7:14 Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs.
30鞠 7:15 "But the LORD took me from following the flock and the LORD said to me, 'Go prophesy to My people Israel.'
30鞠 7:16 "And now hear the word of the LORD： you are saying, 'You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac.'
30鞠 7:17 "Therefore, thus says the LORD, 'Your wife will become a harlot in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be parceled up by a [measuring] line, and you yourself will die upon unclean soil. Moreover, Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'"
30鞠 8:1 Thus the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, [there was] a basket of summer fruit.
30鞠 8:2 And He said, "What do you see, Amos?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come for My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.
30鞠 8:3 "The songs of the palace will turn to wailing in that day," declares the Lord GOD. "Many [will be] the corpses; in every place they will cast them forth in silence."
30鞠 8:4 Hear this, you who trample the needy, to do away with the humble of the land,
30鞠 8:5 saying, "When will the new moon be over, So that we may sell grain, And the sabbath, that we may open the wheat [market], To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger, And to cheat with dishonest scales,
30鞠 8:6 So as to buy the helpless for money And the needy for a pair of sandals, And [that] we may sell the refuse of the wheat? "
30鞠 8:7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob, "Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.
30鞠 8:8 "Because of this will not the land quake And everyone who dwells in it mourn? Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile, And it will be tossed about, And subside like the Nile of Egypt.
30鞠 8:9 "And it will come about in that day," declares the Lord GOD, "That I shall make the sun go down at noon And make the earth dark in broad daylight.
30鞠 8:10 "Then I shall turn your festivals into mourning And all your songs into lamentation; And I will bring sackcloth on everyone's loins And baldness on every head. And I will make it like [a time of] mourning for an only son, And the end of it will be like a bitter day.
30鞠 8:11 "Behold, days are coming," declares the Lord GOD, "When I will send a famine on the land, Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water, But rather for hearing the words of the LORD.
30鞠 8:12 "And people will stagger from sea to sea, And from the north even to the east; They will go to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, But they will not find [it.]
30鞠 8:13 "In that day the beautiful virgins And the young men will faint from thirst.
30鞠 8:14 "[As for] those who swear by the guilt of Samaria, Who say, 'As your god lives, O Dan,' And, 'As the way of Beersheba lives,' They will fall and not rise again."
30鞠 9:1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said, "Smite the capitals so that the thresholds will shake, And break them on the heads of them all! Then I will slay the rest of them with the sword; They will not have a fugitive who will flee, Or a refugee who will escape.
30鞠 9:2 "Though they dig into Sheol, From there shall My hand take them; And though they ascend to heaven, From there will I bring them down.
30鞠 9:3 "And though they hide on the summit of Carmel, I will search them out and take them from there; And though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, From there I will command the serpent and it will bite them.
30鞠 9:4 "And though they go into captivity before their enemies, From there I will command the sword that it slay them, And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good."
30鞠 9:5 And the Lord GOD of hosts, The One who touches the land so that it melts, And all those who dwell in it mourn, And all of it rises up like the Nile And subsides like the Nile of Egypt;
30鞠 9:6 The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavens, And has founded His vaulted dome over the earth, He who calls for the waters of the sea And pours them out on the face of the earth, The LORD is His name.
30鞠 9:7 "Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me, O sons of Israel?" declares the LORD. "Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt, And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
30鞠 9:8 "Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Nevertheless, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," Declares the LORD.
30鞠 9:9 "For behold, I am commanding, And I will shake the house of Israel among all nations As [grain] is shaken in a sieve, But not a kernel will fall to the ground.
30鞠 9:10 "All the sinners of My people will die by the sword, Those who say, ' The calamity will not overtake or confront us. '
30鞠 9:11 "In that day I will raise up the fallen booth of David, And wall up its breaches; I will also raise up its ruins, And rebuild it as in the days of old;
30鞠 9:12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom And all the nations who are called by My name, "Declares the LORD who does this.
30鞠 9:13 "Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "When the plowman will overtake the reaper And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; When the mountains will drip sweet wine, And all the hills will be dissolved.
30鞠 9:14 "Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel, And they will rebuild the ruined cities and live [in them], They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine, And make gardens and eat their fruit.
30鞠 9:15 "I will also plant them on their land, And they will not again be rooted out from their land Which I have given them," Says the LORD your God.

31可 1:1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom-- We have heard a report from the LORD, And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying, "Arise and let us go against her for battle"--
31可 1:2 "Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You are greatly despised.
31可 1:3 "The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?'
31可 1:4 "Though you build high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down," declares the LORD.
31可 1:5 "If thieves came to you, If robbers by night-- O how you will be ruined!-- Would they not steal [only] until they had enough? If grape gatherers came to you, Would they not leave [some] gleanings?
31可 1:6 "O how Esau will be ransacked, And his hidden treasures searched out!
31可 1:7 "All the men allied with you Will send you forth to the border, And the men at peace with you Will deceive you and overpower you. [They who eat] your bread Will set an ambush for you. (There is no understanding in him.)
31可 1:8 "Will I not on that day," declares the LORD, "Destroy wise men from Edom And understanding from the mountain of Esau?
31可 1:9 "Then your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, In order that everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.
31可 1:10 "Because of violence to your brother Jacob, You will be covered [ with] shame, And you will be cut off forever.
31可 1:11 "On the day that you stood aloof, On the day that strangers carried off his wealth, And foreigners entered his gate And cast lots for Jerusalem-- You too were as one of them.
31可 1:12 "Do not gloat over your brother's day, The day of his misfortune. And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah In the day of their destruction; Yes, do not boast In the day of [their] distress.
31可 1:13 "Do not enter the gate of My people In the day of their disaster. Yes, you, do not gloat over their calamity In the day of their disaster. And do not loot their wealth In the day of their disaster.
31可 1:14 "And do not stand at the fork of the road To cut down their fugitives; And do not imprison their survivors In the day of their distress.
31可 1:15 "For the day of the LORD draws near on all the nations. As you have done, it will be done to you. Your dealings will return on your own head.
31可 1:16 "Because just as you drank on My holy mountain, All the nations will drink continually. They will drink and swallow, And become as if they had never existed.
31可 1:17 "But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape, And it will be holy. And the house of Jacob will possess their possessions.
31可 1:18 "Then the house of Jacob will be a fire And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau [will be] as stubble. And they will set them on fire and consume them, So that there will be no survivor of the house of Esau," For the LORD has spoken.
31可 1:19 Then [those of] the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau, And [those of] the Shephelah the Philistine [plain]; Also, they will possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, And Benjamin [will possess] Gilead.
31可 1:20 And the exiles of this host of the sons of Israel, Who are [among] the Canaanites as far as Zarephath, And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Will possess the cities of the Negev.
31可 1:21 The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion To judge the mountain of Esau, And the kingdom will be the Lord's.

32挎 1:1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying,
32挎 1:2 "Arise, go to Nineveh the great city, and cry against it, for their wickedness has come up before Me."
32挎 1:3 But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship which was going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
32挎 1:4 And the LORD hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea so that the ship was about to break up.
32挎 1:5 Then the sailors became afraid, and every man cried to his god, and they threw the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten [it] for them. But Jonah had gone below into the hold of the ship, lain down, and fallen sound asleep.
32挎 1:6 So the captain approached him and said, "How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god. Perhaps [your] god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish."
32挎 1:7 And each man said to his mate, "Come, let us cast lots so we may learn on whose account this calamity [has struck] us." So they cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
32挎 1:8 Then they said to him, "Tell us, now! On whose account [has] this calamity [struck] us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"
32挎 1:9 And he said to them, "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land."
32挎 1:10 Then the men became extremely frightened and they said to him, "How could you do this?" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
32挎 1:11 So they said to him, "What should we do to you that the sea may become calm for us?"-- for the sea was becoming increasingly stormy.
32挎 1:12 And he said to them, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will become calm for you, for I know that on account of me this great storm [has come] upon you."
32挎 1:13 However, the men rowed [desperately] to return to land but they could not, for the sea was becoming [even] stormier against them.
32挎 1:14 Then they called on the LORD and said, "We earnestly pray, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man's life and do not put innocent blood on us; for Thou, O LORD, hast done as Thou hast pleased."
32挎 1:15 So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
32挎 1:16 Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
32挎 1:17 And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish three days and three nights.
32挎 2:1 Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish,
32挎 2:2 and he said, "I called out of my distress to the LORD, And He answered me. I cried for help from the depth of Sheol; Thou didst hear my voice.
32挎 2:3 "For Thou hadst cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the current engulfed me. All Thy breakers and billows passed over me.
32挎 2:4 "So I said, 'I have been expelled from Thy sight. Nevertheless I will look again toward Thy holy temple.'
32挎 2:5 "Water encompassed me to the point of death. The great deep engulfed me, Weeds were wrapped around my head.
32挎 2:6 "I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars [ was] around me forever, But Thou hast brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
32挎 2:7 "While I was fainting away, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer came to Thee, Into Thy holy temple.
32挎 2:8 "Those who regard vain idols Forsake their faithfulness,
32挎 2:9 But I will sacrifice to Thee With the voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD. "
32挎 2:10 Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.
32挎 3:1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,
32挎 3:2 "Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the proclamation which I am going to tell you."
32挎 3:3 So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three days' walk.
32挎 3:4 Then Jonah began to go through the city one day's walk; and he cried out and said, "Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown."
32挎 3:5 Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.
32挎 3:6 When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered [himself] with sackcloth, and sat on the ashes.
32挎 3:7 And he issued a proclamation and it said, "In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles： Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water.
32挎 3:8 "But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands.
32挎 3:9 "Who knows, God may turn and relent, and withdraw His burning anger so that we shall not perish?"
32挎 3:10 When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do [it.]
32挎 4:1 But it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.
32挎 4:2 And he prayed to the LORD and said, "Please LORD, was not this what I said while I was still in my [own] country? Therefore, in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that Thou art a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity.
32挎 4:3 "Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for death is better to me than life."
32挎 4:4 And the LORD said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?"
32挎 4:5 Then Jonah went out from the city and sat east of it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city.
32挎 4:6 So the LORD God appointed a plant and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head to deliver him from his discomfort. And Jonah was extremely happy about the plant.
32挎 4:7 But God appointed a worm when dawn came the next day, and it attacked the plant and it withered.
32挎 4:8 And it came about when the sun came up that God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head so that he became faint and begged with [all] his soul to die, saying, "Death is better to me than life."
32挎 4:9 Then God said to Jonah, "Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "I have good reason to be angry, even to death."
32挎 4:10 Then the LORD said, "You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work, and [which] you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight.
32挎 4:11 "And should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 1200000 persons who do not know [the difference] between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?"

33固 1:1 The word of the LORD which came [to] Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
33固 1:2 Hear, O peoples, all of you; Listen, O earth and all it contains, And let the Lord GOD be a witness against you, The Lord from His holy temple.
33固 1:3 For behold, the LORD is coming forth from His place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
33固 1:4 The mountains will melt under Him, And the valleys will be split, Like wax before the fire, Like water poured down a steep place.
33固 1:5 All this is for the rebellion of Jacob And for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
33固 1:6 For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country, Planting places for a vineyard. I will pour her stones down into the valley, And will lay bare her foundations.
33固 1:7 All of her idols will be smashed, All of her earnings will be burned with fire, And all of her images I will make desolate, For she collected [them] from a harlot's earnings, And to the earnings of a harlot they will return.
33固 1:8 Because of this I must lament and wail, I must go barefoot and naked; I must make a lament like the jackals And a mourning like the ostriches.
33固 1:9 For her wound is incurable, For it has come to Judah; It has reached the gate of my people, [Even] to Jerusalem.
33固 1:10 Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all. At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust.
33固 1:11 Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness. The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape. The lamentation of Beth-ezel： "He will take from you its support."
33固 1:12 For the inhabitant of Maroth Becomes weak waiting for good, Because a calamity has come down from the LORD To the gate of Jerusalem.
33固 1:13 Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitant of Lachish-- She was the beginning of sin To the daughter of Zion-- Because in you were found The rebellious acts of Israel.
33固 1:14 Therefore, you will give parting gifts On behalf of Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib [will] become a deception To the kings of Israel.
33固 1:15 Moreover, I will bring on you The one who takes possession, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will enter Adullam.
33固 1:16 Make yourself bald and cut off your hair, Because of the children of your delight; Extend your baldness like the eagle, For they will go from you into exile.
33固 2:1 Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands.
33固 2:2 They covet fields and then seize [them], And houses, and take [them] away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance.
33固 2:3 Therefore, thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time.
33固 2:4 "On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation [and] say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.'
33固 2:5 "Therefore, you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD.
33固 2:6 'Do not speak out,' [so] they speak out. [But if] they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back.
33固 2:7 "Is it being said, O house of Jacob： 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?' Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly?
33固 2:8 "Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment, From unsuspecting passers-by, [From] those returned from war.
33固 2:9 "The women of My people you evict, Each [one] from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever.
33固 2:10 "Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction.
33固 2:11 "If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies [and said], ' I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor, 'He would be spokesman to this people.
33固 2:12 "I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men.
33固 2:13 "The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate, and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head."
33固 3:1 And I said, "Hear now, heads of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel. Is it not for you to know justice?
33固 3:2 "You who hate good and love evil, Who tear off their skin from them And their flesh from their bones,
33固 3:3 And who eat the flesh of my people, Strip off their skin from them, Break their bones, And chop [them] up as for the pot And as meat in a kettle. "
33固 3:4 Then they will cry out to the LORD, But He will not answer them. Instead, He will hide His face from them at that time, Because they have practiced evil deeds.
33固 3:5 Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets Who lead my people astray; When they have [something] to bite with their teeth, They cry, "Peace," But against him who puts nothing in their mouths, They declare holy war.
33固 3:6 Therefore [it will be] night for you-- without vision, And darkness for you-- without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And the day will become dark over them.
33固 3:7 The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover [their] mouths Because there is no answer from God.
33固 3:8 On the other hand I am filled with power-- With the Spirit of the LORD-- And with justice and courage To make known to Jacob his rebellious act, Even to Israel his sin.
33固 3:9 Now hear this, heads of the house of Jacob And rulers of the house of Israel, Who abhor justice And twist everything that is straight,
33固 3:10 Who build Zion with bloodshed And Jerusalem with violent injustice.
33固 3:11 Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe, Her priests instruct for a price, And her prophets divine for money. Yet they lean on the LORD saying, "Is not the LORD in our midst? Calamity will not come upon us."
33固 3:12 Therefore, on account of you, Zion will be plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, And the mountain of the temple [will become] high places of a forest.
33固 4:1 And it will come about in the last days That the mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains. It will be raised above the hills, And the peoples will stream to it.
33固 4:2 And many nations will come and say, "Come and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD And to the house of the God of Jacob, That He may teach us about His ways And that we may walk in His paths." For from Zion will go forth the law, Even the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
33固 4:3 And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they train for war.
33固 4:4 And each of them will sit under his vine And under his fig tree, With no one to make [them] afraid, For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.
33固 4:5 Though all the peoples walk Each in the name of his god, As for us, we will walk In the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
33固 4:6 "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will assemble the lame, And gather the outcasts, Even those whom I have afflicted.
33固 4:7 "I will make the lame a remnant, And the outcasts a strong nation, And the LORD will reign over them in Mount Zion From now on and forever.
33固 4:8 "And as for you, tower of the flock, Hill of the daughter of Zion, To you it will come-- Even the former dominion will come, The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
33固 4:9 "Now, why do you cry out loudly? Is there no king among you, Or has your counselor perished, That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?
33固 4:10 "Writhe and labor to give birth, Daughter of Zion, Like a woman in childbirth, For now you will go out of the city, Dwell in the field, And go to Babylon. There you will be rescued; There the LORD will redeem you From the hand of your enemies.
33固 4:11 "And now many nations have been assembled against you Who say, 'Let her be polluted, And let our eyes gloat over Zion.'
33固 4:12 "But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, And they do not understand His purpose; For He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
33固 4:13 "Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, For your horn I will make iron And your hoofs I will make bronze, That you may pulverize many peoples, That you may devote to the LORD their unjust gain And their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
33固 5:1 "Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops; They have laid siege against us; With a rod they will smite the judge of Israel on the cheek.
33固 5:2 "But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, [Too] little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity."
33固 5:3 Therefore, He will give them [up] until the time When she who is in labor has borne a child. Then the remainder of His brethren Will return to the sons of Israel.
33固 5:4 And He will arise and shepherd [His flock] In the strength of the LORD, In the majesty of the name of the LORD His God. And they will remain, Because at that time He will be great To the ends of the earth.
33固 5:5 And this One will be [our] peace. When the Assyrian invades our land, When he tramples on our citadels, Then we will raise against him Seven shepherds and eight leaders of men.
33固 5:6 And they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, The land of Nimrod at its entrances; And He will deliver [us] from the Assyrian When he attacks our land And when he tramples our territory.
33固 5:7 Then the remnant of Jacob Will be among many peoples Like dew from the LORD, Like showers on vegetation Which do not wait for man Or delay for the sons of men.
33固 5:8 And the remnant of Jacob Will be among the nations, Among many peoples Like a lion among the beasts of the forest, Like a young lion among flocks of sheep, Which, if he passes through, Tramples down and tears, And there is none to rescue.
33固 5:9 Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, And all your enemies will be cut off.
33固 5:10 "And it will be in that day," declares the LORD, "That I will cut off your horses from among you And destroy your chariots.
33固 5:11 "I will also cut off the cities of your land And tear down all your fortifications.
33固 5:12 "I will cut off sorceries from your hand, And you will have fortunetellers no more.
33固 5:13 "I will cut off your carved images And your [sacred] pillars from among you, So that you will no longer bow down To the work of your hands.
33固 5:14 "I will root out your Asherim from among you And destroy your cities.
33固 5:15 "And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath On the nations which have not obeyed."
33固 6:1 Hear now what the LORD is saying, "Arise, plead your case before the mountains, And let the hills hear your voice.
33固 6:2 "Listen, you mountains, to the indictment of the LORD, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because the LORD has a case against His people; Even with Israel He will dispute.
33固 6:3 "My people, what have I done to you, And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.
33固 6:4 "Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt And ransomed you from the house of slavery, And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
33固 6:5 "My people, remember now What Balak king of Moab counseled And what Balaam son of Beor answered him, [And] from Shittim to Gilgal, In order that you might know the righteous acts of the LORD."
33固 6:6 With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves?
33固 6:7 Does the LORD take delight in thousands of rams, In ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my first-born [for] my rebellious acts, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
33固 6:8 He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God?
33固 6:9 The voice of the LORD will call to the city-- And it is sound wisdom to fear Thy name： "Hear, O tribe. Who has appointed its time?
33固 6:10 "Is there yet a man in the wicked house, [Along with] treasures of wickedness, And a short measure [that is] cursed?
33固 6:11 "Can I justify wicked scales And a bag of deceptive weights?
33固 6:12 "For the rich men of [the] city are full of violence, Her residents speak lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
33固 6:13 "So also I will make [you] sick, striking you down, Desolating [you] because of your sins.
33固 6:14 "You will eat, but you will not be satisfied, And your vileness will be in your midst. You will [try to] remove [for safekeeping], But you will not preserve [anything], And what you do preserve I will give to the sword.
33固 6:15 "You will sow but you will not reap. You will tread the olive but will not anoint yourself with oil; And the grapes, but you will not drink wine.
33固 6:16 "The statutes of Omri And all the works of the house of Ahab are observed; And in their devices you walk. Therefore, I will give you up for destruction And your inhabitants for derision, And you will bear the reproach of My people."
33固 7:1 Woe is me! For I am Like the fruit pickers and the grape gatherers. There is not a cluster of grapes to eat, [Or] a first-ripe fig [which] I crave.
33固 7:2 The godly person has perished from the land, And there is no upright [person] among men. All of them lie in wait for bloodshed; Each of them hunts the other with a net.
33固 7:3 Concerning evil, both hands do it well. The prince asks, also the judge, for a bribe, And a great man speaks the desire of his soul; So they weave it together.
33固 7:4 The best of them is like a briar, The most upright like a thorn hedge. The day when you post a watchman, Your punishment will come. Then their confusion will occur.
33固 7:5 Do not trust in a neighbor; Do not have confidence in a friend. From her who lies in your bosom Guard your lips.
33固 7:6 For son treats father contemptuously, Daughter rises up against her mother, Daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; A man's enemies are the men of his own household.
33固 7:7 But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
33固 7:8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. Though I fall I will rise; Though I dwell in darkness, the LORD is a light for me.
33固 7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD Because I have sinned against Him, Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me out to the light, [And] I will see His righteousness.
33固 7:10 Then my enemy will see, And shame will cover her who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will look on her; At that time she will be trampled down, Like mire of the streets.
33固 7:11 [It will be] a day for building your walls. On that day will your boundary be extended.
33固 7:12 It [will be] a day when they will come to you From Assyria and the cities of Egypt, From Egypt even to the Euphrates, Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
33固 7:13 And the earth will become desolate because of her inhabitants, On account of the fruit of their deeds.
33固 7:14 Shepherd Thy people with Thy scepter, The flock of Thy possession Which dwells by itself in the woodland, In the midst of a fruitful field. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead As in the days of old.
33固 7:15 "As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show you miracles."
33固 7:16 Nations will see and be ashamed Of all their might. They will put [ their] hand on [their] mouth, Their ears will be deaf.
33固 7:17 They will lick the dust like a serpent, Like reptiles of the earth. They will come trembling out of their fortresses; To the LORD our God they will come in dread, And they will be afraid before Thee.
33固 7:18 Who is a God like Thee, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in unchanging love.
33固 7:19 He will again have compassion on us; He will tread our iniquities under foot. Yes, Thou wilt cast all their sins Into the depths of the sea.
33固 7:20 Thou wilt give truth to Jacob [And] unchanging love to Abraham, Which Thou didst swear to our forefathers From the days of old.

34唱 1:1 The oracle of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
34唱 1:2 A jealous and avenging God is the LORD; The LORD is avenging and wrathful. The LORD takes vengeance on His adversaries, And He reserves wrath for His enemies.
34唱 1:3 The LORD is slow to anger and great in power, And the LORD will by no means leave [the guilty] unpunished. In whirlwind and storm is His way, And clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
34唱 1:4 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry; He dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither; The blossoms of Lebanon wither.
34唱 1:5 Mountains quake because of Him, And the hills dissolve; Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, The world and all the inhabitants in it.
34唱 1:6 Who can stand before His indignation? Who can endure the burning of His anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, And the rocks are broken up by Him.
34唱 1:7 The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And He knows those who take refuge in Him.
34唱 1:8 But with an overflowing flood He will make a complete end of its site, And will pursue His enemies into darkness.
34唱 1:9 Whatever you devise against the LORD, He will make a complete end of it. Distress will not rise up twice.
34唱 1:10 Like tangled thorns, And like those who are drunken with their drink, They are consumed As stubble completely withered.
34唱 1:11 From you has gone forth One who plotted evil against the LORD, A wicked counselor.
34唱 1:12 Thus says the LORD, "Though they are at full [strength] and likewise many, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer.
34唱 1:13 "So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you, And I will tear off your shackles."
34唱 1:14 The LORD has issued a command concerning you： "Your name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off idol and image From the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave, For you are contemptible."
34唱 1:15 Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Pay your vows. For never again will the wicked one pass through you; He is cut off completely.
34唱 2:1 The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; Strengthen your back, summon all [your] strength.
34唱 2:2 For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob Like the splendor of Israel, Even though devastators have devastated them And destroyed their vine branches.
34唱 2:3 The shields of his mighty men are [colored] red, The warriors are dressed in scarlet, The chariots are [enveloped] in flashing steel When he is prepared [to march], And the cypress [spears] are brandished.
34唱 2:4 The chariots race madly in the streets, They rush wildly in the squares, Their appearance is like torches, They dash to and fro like lightning flashes.
34唱 2:5 He remembers his nobles; They stumble in their march, They hurry to her wall, And the mantelet is set up.
34唱 2:6 The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved.
34唱 2:7 And it is fixed： She is stripped, she is carried away, And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves, Beating on their breasts.
34唱 2:8 Though Nineveh [was] like a pool of water throughout her days, Now they are fleeing; "Stop, stop," But no one turns back.
34唱 2:9 Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no limit to the treasure-- Wealth from every kind of desirable object.
34唱 2:10 She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste! Hearts are melting and knees knocking! Also anguish is in the whole body, And all their faces are grown pale!
34唱 2:11 Where is the den of the lions And the feeding place of the young lions, Where the lion, lioness, and lion's cub prowled, With nothing to disturb [them]?
34唱 2:12 The lion tore enough for his cubs, Killed [enough] for his lionesses, And filled his lairs with prey And his dens with torn flesh.
34唱 2:13 "Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions, I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard."
34唱 3:1 Woe to the bloody city, completely full of lies [and] pillage; [Her] prey never departs.
34唱 3:2 The noise of the whip, The noise of the rattling of the wheel, Galloping horses, And bounding chariots!
34唱 3:3 Horsemen charging, Swords flashing, spears gleaming, Many slain, a mass of corpses, And countless dead bodies-- They stumble over the dead bodies!
34唱 3:4 [All] because of the many harlotries of the harlot, The charming one, the mistress of sorceries, Who sells nations by her harlotries And families by her sorceries.
34唱 3:5 "Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts; "And I will lift up your skirts over your face, And show to the nations your nakedness And to the kingdoms your disgrace.
34唱 3:6 "I will throw filth on you And make you vile, And set you up as a spectacle.
34唱 3:7 "And it will come about that all who see you Will shrink from you and say, 'Nineveh is devastated! Who will grieve for her?' Where will I seek comforters for you?"
34唱 3:8 Are you better than No-amon, Which was situated by the waters of the Nile, With water surrounding her, Whose rampart [was] the sea, Whose wall [consisted] of the sea?
34唱 3:9 Ethiopia was [her] might, And Egypt too, without limits. Put and Lubim were among her helpers.
34唱 3:10 Yet she became an exile, She went into captivity; Also her small children were dashed to pieces At the head of every street; They cast lots for her honorable men, And all her great men were bound with fetters.
34唱 3:11 You too will become drunk, You will be hidden. You too will search for a refuge from the enemy.
34唱 3:12 All your fortifications are fig trees with ripe fruit-- When shaken, they fall into the eater's mouth.
34唱 3:13 Behold, your people are women in your midst! The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies; Fire consumes your gate bars.
34唱 3:14 Draw for yourself water for the siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Go into the clay and tread the mortar! Take hold of the brick mold!
34唱 3:15 There fire will consume you, The sword will cut you down; It will consume you as the locust [does.] Multiply yourself like the creeping locust, Multiply yourself like the swarming locust.
34唱 3:16 You have increased your traders more than the stars of heaven-- The creeping locust strips and flies away.
34唱 3:17 Your guardsmen are like the swarming locust. Your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers Settling in the stone walls on a cold day. The sun rises and they flee, And the place where they are is not known.
34唱 3:18 Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria; Your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, And there is no one to regather [them.]
34唱 3:19 There is no relief for your breakdown, Your wound is incurable. All who hear about you Will clap [their] hands over you, For on whom has not your evil passed continually?

35钦 1:1 The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
35钦 1:2 How long, O LORD, will I call for help, And Thou wilt not hear? I cry out to Thee, "Violence!" Yet Thou dost not save.
35钦 1:3 Why dost Thou make me see iniquity, And cause [me] to look on wickedness? Yes, destruction and violence are before me; Strife exists and contention arises.
35钦 1:4 Therefore, the law is ignored And justice is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore, justice comes out perverted.
35钦 1:5 "Look among the nations! Observe! Be astonished! Wonder! Because [ I] am doing something in your days-- You would not believe if you were told.
35钦 1:6 "For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, That fierce and impetuous people Who march throughout the earth To seize dwelling places which are not theirs.
35钦 1:7 "They are dreaded and feared. Their justice and authority originate with themselves.
35钦 1:8 "Their horses are swifter than leopards And keener than wolves in the evening. Their horsemen come galloping, Their horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle swooping [down] to devour.
35钦 1:9 "All of them come for violence. Their horde of faces [moves] forward. They collect captives like sand.
35钦 1:10 "They mock at kings, And rulers are a laughing matter to them. They laugh at every fortress, And heap up rubble to capture it.
35钦 1:11 "Then they will sweep through [like] the wind and pass on. But they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god."
35钦 1:12 Art Thou not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. Thou, O LORD, hast appointed them to judge; And Thou, O Rock, hast established them to correct.
35钦 1:13 [Thine] eyes are too pure to approve evil, And Thou canst not look on wickedness [with favor.] Why dost Thou look with favor On those who deal treacherously? Why art Thou silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they?
35钦 1:14 [Why] hast Thou made men like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things without a ruler over them?
35钦 1:15 [The Chaldeans] bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore, they rejoice and are glad.
35钦 1:16 Therefore, they offer a sacrifice to their net. And burn incense to their fishing net; Because through these things their catch is large, And their food is plentiful.
35钦 1:17 Will they therefore empty their net And continually slay nations without sparing?
35钦 2:1 I will stand on my guard post And station myself on the rampart; And I will keep watch to see what He will speak to me, And how I may reply when I am reproved.
35钦 2:2 Then the LORD answered me and said, "Record the vision And inscribe [it] on tablets, That the one who reads it may run.
35钦 2:3 "For the vision is yet for the appointed time; It hastens toward the goal, and it will not fail. Though it tarries, wait for it; For it will certainly come, it will not delay.
35钦 2:4 "Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right within him; But the righteous will live by his faith.
35钦 2:5 "Furthermore, wine betrays the haughty man, So that he does not stay at home. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all nations And collects to himself all peoples.
35钦 2:6 "Will not all of these take up a taunt-song against him, Even mockery [and] insinuations against him, And say, 'Woe to him who increases what is not his-- For how long-- And makes himself rich with loans?'
35钦 2:7 "Will not your creditors rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken? Indeed, you will become plunder for them.
35钦 2:8 "Because you have looted many nations, All the remainder of the peoples will loot you-- Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants.
35钦 2:9 "Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high To be delivered from the hand of calamity!
35钦 2:10 "You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.
35钦 2:11 "Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework.
35钦 2:12 "Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed And founds a town with violence!
35钦 2:13 "Is it not indeed from the LORD of hosts That peoples toil for fire, And nations grow weary for nothing?
35钦 2:14 "For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, As the waters cover the sea.
35钦 2:15 "Woe to you who make your neighbors drink, Who mix in your venom even to make [them] drunk So as to look on their nakedness!
35钦 2:16 "You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor. Now you yourself drink and expose your [own] nakedness. The cup in the Lord's right hand will come around to you, And utter disgrace [will come] upon your glory.
35钦 2:17 "For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, And the devastation of [its] beasts by which you terrified them, Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants.
35钦 2:18 "What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it, [Or] an image, a teacher of falsehood? For [its] maker trusts in his [own] handiwork When he fashions speechless idols.
35钦 2:19 "Woe to him who says to a [piece of] wood, 'Awake!' To a dumb stone, 'Arise!' [And] that is [your] teacher? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, And there is no breath at all inside it.
35钦 2:20 "But the LORD is in His holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before Him."
35钦 3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
35钦 3:2 LORD, I have heard the report about Thee [and] I fear. O LORD, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.
35钦 3:3 God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise.
35钦 3:4 [His] radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays [flashing] from His hand, And there is the hiding of His power.
35钦 3:5 Before Him goes pestilence, And plague comes after Him.
35钦 3:6 He stood and surveyed the earth; He looked and startled the nations. Yes, the perpetual mountains were shattered, The ancient hills collapsed. His ways are everlasting.
35钦 3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.
35钦 3:8 Did the LORD rage against the rivers, Or [was] Thine anger against the rivers, Or [was] Thy wrath against the sea, That Thou didst ride on Thy horses, On Thy chariots of salvation?
35钦 3:9 Thy bow was made bare, The rods of chastisement were sworn. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
35钦 3:10 The mountains saw Thee [and] quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep uttered forth its voice, It lifted high its hands.
35钦 3:11 Sun [and] moon stood in their places; They went away at the light of Thine arrows, At the radiance of Thy gleaming spear.
35钦 3:12 In indignation Thou didst march through the earth; In anger Thou didst trample the nations.
35钦 3:13 Thou didst go forth for the salvation of Thy people, For the salvation of Thine anointed. Thou didst strike the head of the house of the evil To lay him open from thigh to neck. Selah.
35钦 3:14 Thou didst pierce with his own spears The head of his throngs. They stormed in to scatter us; Their exultation [was] like those Who devour the oppressed in secret.
35钦 3:15 Thou didst tread on the sea with Thy horses, On the surge of many waters.
35钦 3:16 I heard and my inward parts trembled, At the sound my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble. Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, For the people to arise [who] will invade us.
35钦 3:17 Though the fig tree should not blossom, And there be no fruit on the vines, [Though] the yield of the olive should fail, And the fields produce no food, Though the flock should be cut off from the fold, And there be no cattle in the stalls,
35钦 3:18 Yet I will exult in the LORD, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
35钦 3:19 The Lord GOD is my strength, And He has made my feet like hinds' [ feet,] And makes me walk on my high places. For the choir director, on my stringed instruments.

36嚼 1:1 The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah,
36嚼 1:2 "I will completely remove all [things] From the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
36嚼 1:3 "I will remove man and beast; I will remove the birds of the sky And the fish of the sea, And the ruins along with the wicked; And I will cut off man from the face of the earth," declares the LORD.
36嚼 1:4 "So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [And] the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests.
36嚼 1:5 "And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, And those who bow down [and] swear to the LORD and [yet] swear by Milcom,
36嚼 1:6 And those who have turned back from following the LORD, And those who have not sought the LORD or inquired of Him. "
36嚼 1:7 Be silent before the Lord GOD! For the day of the LORD is near, For the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, He has consecrated His guests.
36嚼 1:8 "Then it will come about on the day of the Lord's sacrifice, That I will punish the princes, the king's sons, And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments.
36嚼 1:9 "And I will punish on that day all who leap on the [temple] threshold, Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.
36嚼 1:10 "And on that day," declares the LORD, "There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, A wail from the Second Quarter, And a loud crash from the hills.
36嚼 1:11 "Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar, For all the people of Canaan will be silenced; All who weigh out silver will be cut off.
36嚼 1:12 "And it will come about at that time That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the men Who are stagnant in spirit, Who say in their hearts, 'The LORD will not do good or evil!'
36嚼 1:13 "Moreover, their wealth will become plunder, And their houses desolate; Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit [them], And plant vineyards but not drink their wine."
36嚼 1:14 Near is the great day of the LORD, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the LORD! In it the warrior cries out bitterly.
36嚼 1:15 A day of wrath is that day, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness,
36嚼 1:16 A day of trumpet and battle cry, Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers.
36嚼 1:17 And I will bring distress on men, So that they will walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the LORD; And their blood will be poured out like dust, And their flesh like dung.
36嚼 1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to deliver them On the day of the Lord's wrath; And all the earth will be devoured In the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a terrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth.
36嚼 2:1 Gather yourselves together, yes, gather, O nation without shame,

36嚼 2:3 Seek the LORD, All you humble of the earth Who have carried out His ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will be hidden In the day of the Lord's anger.
36嚼 2:4 For Gaza will be abandoned, And Ashkelon a desolation; Ashdod will be driven out at noon, And Ekron will be uprooted.
36嚼 2:5 Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will destroy you, So that there will be no inhabitant.
36嚼 2:6 So the seacoast will be pastures, [With] caves for shepherds and folds for flocks.
36嚼 2:7 And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortune.
36嚼 2:8 "I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory.
36嚼 2:9 "Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, "Surely Moab will be like Sodom, And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah-- A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them, And the remainder of My nation will inherit them."
36嚼 2:10 This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts.
36嚼 2:11 The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his [own] place.
36嚼 2:12 "You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword."
36嚼 2:13 And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness.
36嚼 2:14 And flocks will lie down in her midst, All beasts which range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will lodge in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Desolation [will be] on the threshold; For He has laid bare the cedar work.
36嚼 2:15 This is the exultant city Which dwells securely, Who says in her heart, "I am, and there is no one besides me." How she has become a desolation, A resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss [And] wave his hand [in contempt.]
36嚼 3:1 Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city!
36嚼 3:2 She heeded no voice; She accepted no instruction. She did not trust in the LORD; She did not draw near to her God.
36嚼 3:3 Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They leave nothing for the morning.
36嚼 3:4 Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.
36嚼 3:5 The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust knows no shame.
36嚼 3:6 "I have cut off nations; Their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate, With no one passing by; Their cities are laid waste, Without a man, without an inhabitant.
36嚼 3:7 "I said, 'Surely you will revere Me, Accept instruction.' So her dwelling will not be cut off [According to] all that I have appointed concerning her. But they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.
36嚼 3:8 "Therefore, wait for Me," declares the LORD, "For the day when I rise up to the prey. Indeed, My decision is to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal.
36嚼 3:9 "For then I will give to the peoples purified lips, That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder.
36嚼 3:10 "From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings.
36嚼 3:11 "In that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, exulting ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain.
36嚼 3:12 "But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD.
36嚼 3:13 "The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they shall feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble."
36嚼 3:14 Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Shout [in triumph,] O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all [your] heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
36嚼 3:15 The LORD has taken away [His] judgments against you, He has cleared away your enemies. The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; You will fear disaster no more.
36嚼 3:16 In that day it will be said to Jerusalem： "Do not be afraid, O Zion; Do not let your hands fall limp.
36嚼 3:17 "The LORD your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.
36嚼 3:18 "I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts-- They came from you, [O Zion;] [The] reproach [of exile] is a burden on them.
36嚼 3:19 "Behold, I am going to deal at that time With all your oppressors, I will save the lame And gather the outcast, And I will turn their shame into praise and renown In all the earth.
36嚼 3:20 "At that time I will bring you in, Even at the time when I gather you together; Indeed, I will give you renown and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I restore your fortunes before your eyes," Says the LORD.

37切 1:1 In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest saying,
37切 1:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'This people says," The time has not come, [even] the time for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt. "'"
37切 1:3 Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying,
37切 1:4 "Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house [lies] desolate?"
37切 1:5 Now therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways!
37切 1:6 "You have sown much, but harvest little; [you] eat, but [there is] not [enough] to be satisfied; [you] drink, but [there is] not [enough] to become drunk; [you] put on clothing, but no one is warm [enough]; and he who earns, earns wages [to put] into a purse with holes."
37切 1:7 Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Consider your ways!
37切 1:8 "Go up to the mountains, bring wood and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified," says the LORD.
37切 1:9 "[You] look for much, but behold, [it comes] to little; when you bring [it] home, I blow it [away.] Why?" declares the LORD of hosts, "Because of My house which [lies] desolate, while each of you runs to his own house.
37切 1:10 "Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
37切 1:11 "And I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands."
37切 1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the LORD.
37切 1:13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke by the commission of the LORD to the people saying, "'I am with you,' declares the LORD."
37切 1:14 So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
37切 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.
37切 2:1 On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet saying,
37切 2:2 "Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying,
37切 2:3 'Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison?
37切 2:4 'But now take courage, Zerubbabel,' declares the LORD, 'take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land take courage,' declares the LORD, 'and work; for I am with you,' says the LORD of hosts.
37切 2:5 'As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear!'
37切 2:6 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Once more in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land.
37切 2:7 'And I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations; and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of hosts.
37切 2:8 'The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,' declares the LORD of hosts.
37切 2:9 'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and in this place I shall give peace,' declares the LORD of hosts. "
37切 2:10 On the twenty-fourth of the ninth [month,] in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet saying,
37切 2:11 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Ask now the priests [for] a ruling：
37切 2:12 'If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and touches bread with this fold, or cooked food, wine, oil, or any [other] food, will it become holy?' "And the priests answered and said," No. "
37切 2:13 Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these, will [the latter] become unclean?" And the priests answered and said, "It will become unclean."
37切 2:14 Then Haggai answered and said, "'So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,' declares the LORD, 'and so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
37切 2:15 'But now, do consider from this day onward： before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,
37切 2:16 from that time [when] one came to a [grain] heap of twenty [measures,] there would be only ten; and [when] one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there would be [only] twenty.
37切 2:17 'I smote you [and] every work of your hands with blasting wind, mildew, and hail; yet you [did] not [come back] to Me,' declares the LORD.
37切 2:18 'Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month]; from the day when the temple of the LORD was founded, consider：
37切 2:19 'Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree, it has not borne [fruit.] Yet from this day on I will bless [you.]' "
37切 2:20 Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth [day] of the month saying,
37切 2:21 "Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah saying, 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
37切 2:22 'And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, everyone by the sword of another.'
37切 2:23 'On that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,' declares the LORD, 'and I will make you like a signet [ring,] for I have chosen you,' "declares the LORD of hosts.

38交 1:1 In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,
38交 1:2 "The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
38交 1:3 "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," Return to Me, "declares the LORD of hosts," that I may return to you, "says the LORD of hosts.
38交 1:4 "Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds. "'But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD.
38交 1:5 "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
38交 1:6 "But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, ' As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us. '"'"
38交 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows：
38交 1:8 I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel, and white horses behind him.
38交 1:9 Then I said, "My lord, what are these?" And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "I will show you what these are."
38交 1:10 And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, "These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."
38交 1:11 So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, "We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet."
38交 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, "O LORD of hosts, how long wilt Thou have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which Thou hast been indignant these seventy years?"
38交 1:13 And the LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.
38交 1:14 So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion.
38交 1:15 "But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster."
38交 1:16 'Therefore, thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."'
38交 1:17 "Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem. "'"
38交 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, [there were] four horns.
38交 1:19 So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?" And he answered me," These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. "
38交 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
38交 1:21 And I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head; but these [craftsmen] have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up [their] horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it."
38交 2:1 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, [there was] a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38交 2:2 So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is."
38交 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,
38交 2:4 and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.
38交 2:5 'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.' "
38交 2:6 "Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, " for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens, "declares the LORD.
38交 2:7 "Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."
38交 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.
38交 2:9 "For behold, I will wave My hand over them, so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.
38交 2:10 "Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.
38交 2:11 "And many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.
38交 2:12 "And the LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
38交 2:13 "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."
38交 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
38交 3:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"
38交 3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.
38交 3:4 And he spoke and said to those who were standing before him saying, " Remove the filthy garments from him. "Again he said to him," See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes. "
38交 3:5 Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.
38交 3:6 And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua saying,
38交 3:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways, and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing [here.]
38交 3:8 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you-- indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.
38交 3:9 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
38交 3:10 'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to [sit] under [his] vine and under [his] fig tree.' "
38交 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned, and roused me as a man who is awakened from his sleep.
38交 4:2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;
38交 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side. "
38交 4:4 Then I answered and said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"
38交 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
38交 4:6 Then he answered and said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.
38交 4:7 'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel [you will become] a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"' "
38交 4:8 Also the word of the LORD came to me saying,
38交 4:9 "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish [it.] Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
38交 4:10 "For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel-- [these are] the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth."
38交 4:11 Then I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"
38交 4:12 And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden [oil] from themselves?"
38交 4:13 So he answered me saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
38交 4:14 Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."
38交 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, [there was] a flying scroll.
38交 5:2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."
38交 5:3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.
38交 5:4 "I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."
38交 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and said to me, " Lift up now your eyes, and see what this is, going forth. "
38交 5:6 And I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land
38交 5:7 (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah. "
38交 5:8 Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.
38交 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
38交 5:10 And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"
38交 5:11 Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."
38交 6:1 Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains [were] bronze mountains.
38交 6:2 With the first chariot [were] red horses, with the second chariot black horses,
38交 6:3 with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.
38交 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"
38交 6:5 And the angel answered and said to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,
38交 6:6 with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.
38交 6:7 "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
38交 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north."
38交 6:9 The word of the LORD also came to me saying,
38交 6:10 "Take [an offering] from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.
38交 6:11 "And take silver and gold, make an [ornate] crown, and set [it] on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
38交 6:12 "Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.
38交 6:13 "Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices." '
38交 6:14 "Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.
38交 6:15 "And those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place, if you completely obey the LORD your God.
38交 7:1 Then it came about in the fourth year of King Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth [day] of the ninth month, [which is] Chislev.
38交 7:2 Now [the town of] Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,
38交 7:3 speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?"
38交 7:4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying,
38交 7:5 "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?
38交 7:6 'And when you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?
38交 7:7 'Are not [these] the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?' "
38交 7:8 Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,
38交 7:9 "Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice, and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;
38交 7:10 and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another. '
38交 7:11 "But they refused to pay attention, and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.
38交 7:12 "And they made their hearts [like] flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
38交 7:13 "And it came about that just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;
38交 7:14 "but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them, so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate."
38交 8:1 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came saying,
38交 8:2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.'
38交 8:3 "Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts [will be called] the Holy Mountain.'
38交 8:4 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.
38交 8:5 'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.'
38交 8:6 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.
38交 8:7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;
38交 8:8 and I will bring them [back,] and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem, and they will be My people and I will be their God in truth and righteousness. '
38交 8:9 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, [those] who [spoke] in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.
38交 8:10 'For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.
38交 8:11 'But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.
38交 8:12 'For [there will be] peace for the seed： the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these [things.]
38交 8:13 'And it will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'
38交 8:14 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented,
38交 8:15 so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!
38交 8:16 'These are the things which you should do： speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.
38交 8:17 'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD. "
38交 8:18 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying,
38交 8:19 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth [months] will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.'
38交 8:20 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, '[It will] yet [be] that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
38交 8:21 'And the inhabitants of one will go to another saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go."
38交 8:22 'So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'
38交 8:23 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew saying," Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. "'"
38交 9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD),
38交 9:2 And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
38交 9:3 For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.
38交 9:4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.
38交 9:5 Ashkelon will see [it] and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
38交 9:6 And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
38交 9:7 And I will remove their blood from their mouth, And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.
38交 9:8 But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.
38交 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout [in triumph,] O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38交 9:10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
38交 9:11 As for you also, because of the blood of [My] covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.
38交 9:12 Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.
38交 9:13 For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior's sword.
38交 9:14 Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south.
38交 9:15 The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour, and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink, [and] be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a [sacrificial] basin, [Drenched] like the corners of the altar.
38交 9:16 And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For [they are as] the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.
38交 9:17 For what comeliness and beauty [will be] theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
38交 10:1 Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain-- The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to [each] man.
38交 10:2 For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions, And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore [the people] wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
38交 10:3 "My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.
38交 10:4 "From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, [all] of them together.
38交 10:5 "And they will be as mighty men, Treading down [the enemy] in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD [will be] with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.
38交 10:6 "And I shall strengthen the house of Judah, And I shall save the house of Joseph, And I shall bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God, and I will answer them.
38交 10:7 "And Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if [from] wine; Indeed, their children will see [it] and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.
38交 10:8 "I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before.
38交 10:9 "When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back.
38交 10:10 "I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, Until no [room] can be found for them.
38交 10:11 "And He will pass through the sea [of] distress, And strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down, And the scepter of Egypt will depart.
38交 10:12 "And I shall strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD.
38交 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.
38交 11:2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious [trees] have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.
38交 11:3 There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
38交 11:4 Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock [doomed] to slaughter.
38交 11:5 "Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and [each of] those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them.
38交 11:6 "For I shall no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I shall cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I shall not deliver [them] from their power."
38交 11:7 So I pastured the flock [doomed] to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs： the one I called Favor, and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock.
38交 11:8 Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.
38交 11:9 Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh."
38交 11:10 And I took my staff, Favor, and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
38交 11:11 So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.
38交 11:12 And I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give [me] my wages; but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty [shekels] of silver as my wages.
38交 11:13 Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, [that] magnificent price at which I was valued by them." So I took the thirty [shekels] of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
38交 11:14 Then I cut my second staff, Union, in pieces, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
38交 11:15 And the LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
38交 11:16 "For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat [sheep] and tear off their hoofs.
38交 11:17 "Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered, And his right eye will be blind."
38交 12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. [Thus] declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,
38交 12:2 "Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.
38交 12:3 "And it will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.
38交 12:4 "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment, and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
38交 12:5 "Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.'
38交 12:6 "In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.
38交 12:7 "The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first in order that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.
38交 12:8 "In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David [will be] like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.
38交 12:9 "And it will come about in that day that I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38交 12:10 "And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him, like the bitter weeping over a first-born.
38交 12:11 "In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
38交 12:12 "And the land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38交 12:13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
38交 12:14 all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.
38交 13:1 "In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.
38交 13:2 "And it will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.
38交 13:3 "And it will come about that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.
38交 13:4 "Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;
38交 13:5 but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.'
38交 13:6 "And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say,' [Those] with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. '
38交 13:7 "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.
38交 13:8 "And it will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off [and] perish; But the third will be left in it.
38交 13:9 "And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"
38交 14:1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.
38交 14:2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished, and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.
38交 14:3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.
38交 14:4 And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.
38交 14:5 And you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, [and] all the holy ones with Him!
38交 14:6 And it will come about in that day that there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.
38交 14:7 For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.
38交 14:8 And it will come about in that day that living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.
38交 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be [the only] one, and His name [the only] one.
38交 14:10 All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.
38交 14:11 And people will live in it, and there will be no more curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.
38交 14:12 Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.
38交 14:13 And it will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.
38交 14:14 And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.
38交 14:15 So also like this plague, will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey, and all the cattle that will be in those camps.
38交 14:16 Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
38交 14:17 And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.
38交 14:18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no [rain will fall] on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
38交 14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
38交 14:20 In that day there will [be inscribed] on the bells of the horses, " HOLY TO THE LORD. "And the cooking pots in the Lord's house will be like the bowls before the altar.
38交 14:21 And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.

39富 1:1 The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.
39富 1:2 "I have loved you," says the LORD. But you say, "How hast Thou loved us?" "[Was] not Esau Jacob's brother?" declares the LORD. "Yet I have loved Jacob;
39富 1:3 but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation, and [appointed] his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness. "
39富 1:4 Though Edom says, "We have been beaten down, but we will return and build up the ruins"; thus says the LORD of hosts, "They may build, but I will tear down; and [men] will call them the wicked territory, and the people toward whom the LORD is indignant forever."
39富 1:5 And your eyes will see this and you will say, "The LORD be magnified beyond the border of Israel!"
39富 1:6 "'A son honors [his] father, and a servant his master. Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My respect?' says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say,' How have we despised Thy name?'
39富 1:7 "[You] are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you say, 'How have we defiled Thee?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to be despised.'
39富 1:8 "But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts.
39富 1:9 "But now will you not entreat God's favor, that He may be gracious to us? With such an offering on your part, will He receive any of you kindly?" says the LORD of hosts.
39富 1:10 "Oh that there were one among you who would shut the gates, that you might not uselessly kindle [fire on] My altar! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD of hosts, "nor will I accept an offering from you.
39富 1:11 "For from the rising of the sun, even to its setting, My name [will be] great among the nations, and in every place incense is going to be offered to My name, and a grain offering [that is] pure; for My name [will be] great among the nations," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 1:12 "But you are profaning it, in that you say, 'The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.'
39富 1:13 "You also say, 'My, how tiresome it is!' And you disdainfully sniff at it," says the LORD of hosts, "and you bring what was taken by robbery, and [what is] lame or sick; so you bring the offering! Should I receive that from your hand?" says the LORD.
39富 1:14 "But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock, and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord, for I am a great King," says the LORD of hosts, "and My name is feared among the nations."
39富 2:1 "And now, this commandment is for you, O priests.
39富 2:2 "If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My name," says the LORD of hosts, "then I will send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them [already], because you are not taking [it] to heart.
39富 2:3 "Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.
39富 2:4 "Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that My covenant may continue with Levi," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 2:5 "My covenant with him was [one of] life and peace, and I gave them to him [as an object of] reverence; so he revered Me, and stood in awe of My name.
39富 2:6 "True instruction was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many back from iniquity.
39富 2:7 "For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
39富 2:8 "But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by the instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 2:9 "So I also have made you despised and abased before all the people, just as you are not keeping My ways, but are showing partiality in the instruction.
39富 2:10 "Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
39富 2:11 "Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
39富 2:12 "[As] for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob [everyone] who awakes and answers, or who presents an offering to the LORD of hosts.
39富 2:13 "And this is another thing you do： you cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning, because He no longer regards the offering or accepts [it with] favor from your hand.
39富 2:14 "Yet you say, 'For what reason?' Because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
39富 2:15 "But not one has done [so] who has a remnant of the Spirit. And what did [that] one [do] while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then, to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth.
39富 2:16 "For I hate divorce," says the LORD, the God of Israel, "and him who covers his garment with wrong," says the LORD of hosts. "So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal treacherously."
39富 2:17 You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied [Him]?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them," or, "Where is the God of justice?"
39富 3:1 "Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 3:2 "But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap.
39富 3:3 "And He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.
39富 3:4 "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD, as in the days of old and as in former years.
39富 3:5 "Then I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien, and do not fear Me," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 3:6 "For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
39富 3:7 "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes, and have not kept [them.] Return to Me, and I will return to you," says the LORD of hosts." But you say, 'How shall we return?'
39富 3:8 "Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, 'How have we robbed Thee?' In tithes and offerings.
39富 3:9 "You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation [of you]!
39富 3:10 "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this," says the LORD of hosts, "if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.
39富 3:11 "Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it may not destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast [its grapes]," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 3:12 "And all the nations will call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 3:13 "Your words have been arrogant against Me," says the LORD. "Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against Thee?'
39富 3:14 "You have said, 'It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before the LORD of hosts?
39富 3:15 'So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers of wickedness built up, but they also test God and escape.' "
39富 3:16 Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD gave attention and heard [it,] and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name.
39富 3:17 "And they will be Mine," says the LORD of hosts, "on the day that I prepare [My] own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him."
39富 3:18 So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.
39富 4:1 "For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze," says the LORD of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch."
39富 4:2 "But for you who fear My name the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall.
39富 4:3 "And you will tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing," says the LORD of hosts.
39富 4:4 "Remember the law of Moses My servant, [even the] statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel.
39富 4:5 "Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
39富 4:6 "And he will restore the hearts of the fathers to [their] children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the land with a curse."
