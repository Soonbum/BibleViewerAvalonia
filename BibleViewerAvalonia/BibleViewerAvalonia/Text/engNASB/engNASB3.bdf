11¿Õ»ó 1:1 Now King David was old, advanced in age; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not keep warm.
11¿Õ»ó 1:2 So his servants said to him, "Let them seek a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her attend the king and become his nurse; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm."
11¿Õ»ó 1:3 So they searched for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:4 And the girl was very beautiful; and she became the king's nurse and served him, but the king did not cohabit with her.
11¿Õ»ó 1:5 Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." So he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen with fifty men to run before him.
11¿Õ»ó 1:6 And his father had never crossed him at any time by asking, "Why have you done so?" And he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.
11¿Õ»ó 1:7 And he had conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and following Adonijah they helped him.
11¿Õ»ó 1:8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
11¿Õ»ó 1:9 And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
11¿Õ»ó 1:10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.
11¿Õ»ó 1:11 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, "Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know [it?]
11¿Õ»ó 1:12 "So now come, please let me give you counsel and save your life and the life of your son Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:13 "Go at once to King David and say to him, 'Have you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your maidservant, saying," Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne "?Why then has Adonijah become king?'
11¿Õ»ó 1:14 "Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words."
11¿Õ»ó 1:15 So Bathsheba went in to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:16 Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, "What do you wish?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:17 And she said to him, "My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God, [saying,] 'Surely your son Solomon shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne.'
11¿Õ»ó 1:18 "And now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know [it.]
11¿Õ»ó 1:19 "And he has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army; but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
11¿Õ»ó 1:20 "And as for you now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
11¿Õ»ó 1:21 "Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders."
11¿Õ»ó 1:22 And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
11¿Õ»ó 1:23 And they told the king, saying, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.
11¿Õ»ó 1:24 Then Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne'?
11¿Õ»ó 1:25 "For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they say, '[Long] live King Adonijah!'
11¿Õ»ó 1:26 "But me, [even] me your servant, and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon, he has not invited.
11¿Õ»ó 1:27 "Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:28 Then King David answered and said, "Call Bathsheba to me." And she came into the king's presence and stood before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:29 And the king vowed and said, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,
11¿Õ»ó 1:30 surely as I vowed to you by the LORD the God of Israel, saying, ' Your son Solomon shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place ';I will indeed do so this day. "
11¿Õ»ó 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, "May my lord King David live forever."
11¿Õ»ó 1:32 Then King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." And they came into the king's presence.
11¿Õ»ó 1:33 And the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:34 "And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, '[Long] live King Solomon!'
11¿Õ»ó 1:35 "Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
11¿Õ»ó 1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, "Amen! Thus may the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say.
11¿Õ»ó 1:37 "As the LORD has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
11¿Õ»ó 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
11¿Õ»ó 1:39 Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "[ Long] live King Solomon!"
11¿Õ»ó 1:40 And all the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise.
11¿Õ»ó 1:41 Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard [it,] as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "Why is the city making such an uproar?"
11¿Õ»ó 1:42 While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news."
11¿Õ»ó 1:43 But Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, "No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
11¿Õ»ó 1:44 "The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king's mule.
11¿Õ»ó 1:45 "And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard.
11¿Õ»ó 1:46 "Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom.
11¿Õ»ó 1:47 "And moreover, the king's servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!' And the king bowed himself on the bed.
11¿Õ»ó 1:48 "The king has also said thus, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne today while my own eyes see [ it.]'"
11¿Õ»ó 1:49 Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified; and they arose and each went on his way.
11¿Õ»ó 1:50 And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, and he arose, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11¿Õ»ó 1:51 Now it was told Solomon, saying, "Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"
11¿Õ»ó 1:52 And Solomon said, "If he will be a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die."
11¿Õ»ó 1:53 So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."
11¿Õ»ó 2:1 As David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 2:2 "I am going the way of all the earth. Be strong, therefore, and show yourself a man.
11¿Õ»ó 2:3 "And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the law of Moses, that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,
11¿Õ»ó 2:4 so that the LORD may carry out His promise which He spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons are careful of their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:5 "Now you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed; he also shed the blood of war in peace. And he put the blood of war on his belt about his waist, and on his sandals on his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 2:6 "So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace.
11¿Õ»ó 2:7 "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for they assisted me when I fled from Absalom your brother.
11¿Õ»ó 2:8 "And behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite, of Bahurim; now it was he who cursed me with a violent curse on the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:9 "Now therefore, do not let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you will bring his gray hair down to Sheol with blood."
11¿Õ»ó 2:10 Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
11¿Õ»ó 2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years£º seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 2:12 And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
11¿Õ»ó 2:13 Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, "Do you come peacefully?" And he said, "Peacefully."
11¿Õ»ó 2:14 Then he said, "I have something [to say] to you." And she said, "Speak."
11¿Õ»ó 2:15 So he said, "You know that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel expected me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 2:16 "And now I am making one request of you; do not refuse me." And she said to him, "Speak."
11¿Õ»ó 2:17 Then he said, "Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife."
11¿Õ»ó 2:18 And Bathsheba said, "Very well; I will speak to the king for you."
11¿Õ»ó 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king arose to meet her, bowed before her, and sat on his throne; then he had a throne set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.
11¿Õ»ó 2:20 Then she said, "I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you."
11¿Õ»ó 2:21 So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife."
11¿Õ»ó 2:22 And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, "And why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom-- for he is my older brother-- even for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!"
11¿Õ»ó 2:23 Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, "May God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.
11¿Õ»ó 2:24 "Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as He promised, surely Adonijah will be put to death today."
11¿Õ»ó 2:25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him so that he died.
11¿Õ»ó 2:26 Then to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth to your own field, for you deserve to die; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and because you were afflicted in everything with which my father was afflicted."
11¿Õ»ó 2:27 So Solomon dismissed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD, which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
11¿Õ»ó 2:28 Now the news came to Joab, for Joab had followed Adonijah, although he had not followed Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
11¿Õ»ó 2:29 And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, fall upon him."
11¿Õ»ó 2:30 So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD, and said to him, "Thus the king has said, 'Come out.'" But he said, "No, for I will die here." And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus spoke Joab, and thus he answered me."
11¿Õ»ó 2:31 And the king said to him, "Do as he has spoken and fall upon him and bury him, that you may remove from me and from my father's house the blood which Joab shed without cause.
11¿Õ»ó 2:32 "And the LORD will return his blood on his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and killed them with the sword, while my father David did not know [it:] Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 2:33 "So shall their blood return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever; but to David and his descendants and his house and his throne, may there be peace from the LORD forever."
11¿Õ»ó 2:34 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.
11¿Õ»ó 2:35 And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
11¿Õ»ó 2:36 Now the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, "Build for yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place.
11¿Õ»ó 2:37 "For it will happen on the day you go out and cross over the brook Kidron, you will know for certain that you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head."
11¿Õ»ó 2:38 Shimei then said to the king, "The word is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
11¿Õ»ó 2:39 But it came about at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, "Behold, your servants are in Gath."
11¿Õ»ó 2:40 Then Shimei arose and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to look for his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
11¿Õ»ó 2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
11¿Õ»ó 2:42 So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, 'You will know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere, you shall surely die'? And you said to me, 'The word which I have heard is good.'
11¿Õ»ó 2:43 "Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the command which I have laid on you?"
11¿Õ»ó 2:44 The king also said to Shimei, "You know all the evil which you acknowledge in your heart, which you did to my father David; therefore the LORD shall return your evil on your own head.
11¿Õ»ó 2:45 "But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever."
11¿Õ»ó 2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him so that he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hands of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 3:1 Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the city of David, until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 3:2 The people were still sacrificing on the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days.
11¿Õ»ó 3:3 Now Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David, except he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
11¿Õ»ó 3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; and God said, "Ask what [you wish] me to give you."
11¿Õ»ó 3:6 Then Solomon said, "Thou hast shown great lovingkindness to Thy servant David my father, according as he walked before Thee in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart toward Thee; and Thou hast reserved for him this great lovingkindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] this day.
11¿Õ»ó 3:7 "And now, O LORD my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
11¿Õ»ó 3:8 "And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people who cannot be numbered or counted for multitude.
11¿Õ»ó 3:9 "So give Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Thine?"
11¿Õ»ó 3:10 And it was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
11¿Õ»ó 3:11 And God said to him, "Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice,
11¿Õ»ó 3:12 behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.
11¿Õ»ó 3:13 "And I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days.
11¿Õ»ó 3:14 "And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then I will prolong your days."
11¿Õ»ó 3:15 Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
11¿Õ»ó 3:16 Then two women who were harlots came to the king and stood before him.
11¿Õ»ó 3:17 And the one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house; and I gave birth to a child while she [was] in the house.
11¿Õ»ó 3:18 "And it happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth to a child, and we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, only the two of us in the house.
11¿Õ»ó 3:19 "And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on it.
11¿Õ»ó 3:20 "So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
11¿Õ»ó 3:21 "And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I had borne."
11¿Õ»ó 3:22 Then the other woman said, "No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son." But the first woman said, "No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son." Thus they spoke before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 3:23 Then the king said, "The one says, 'This is my son who is living, and your son is the dead one'; and the other says, 'No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'"
11¿Õ»ó 3:24 And the king said, "Get me a sword." So they brought a sword before the king.
11¿Õ»ó 3:25 And the king said, "Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other."
11¿Õ»ó 3:26 Then the woman whose child [was] the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply stirred over her son and said, "Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him." But the other said, "He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide [him!]"
11¿Õ»ó 3:27 Then the king answered and said, "Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him. She is his mother."
11¿Õ»ó 3:28 When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had handed down, they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
11¿Õ»ó 4:1 Now King Solomon was king over all Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 4:2 And these were his officials£º Azariah the son of Zadok [was] the priest;
11¿Õ»ó 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha [were] secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] the recorder;
11¿Õ»ó 4:4 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar [were] priests;
11¿Õ»ó 4:5 and Azariah the son of Nathan [was] over the deputies; and Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest, [was] the king's friend;
11¿Õ»ó 4:6 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda [was] over the men subject to forced labor.
11¿Õ»ó 4:7 And Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year.
11¿Õ»ó 4:8 And these are their names£º Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
11¿Õ»ó 4:9 Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan;
11¿Õ»ó 4:10 Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh [was] his and all the land of Hepher);
11¿Õ»ó 4:11 Ben-abinadab, [in] all the height of Dor (Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife);
11¿Õ»ó 4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud, [in] Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam;
11¿Õ»ó 4:13 Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his£º the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars [were] his);
11¿Õ»ó 4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, [in] Mahanaim;
11¿Õ»ó 4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also married Basemath the daughter of Solomon);
11¿Õ»ó 4:16 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
11¿Õ»ó 4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
11¿Õ»ó 4:18 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
11¿Õ»ó 4:19 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and [he was] the only deputy who [was] in the land.
11¿Õ»ó 4:20 Judah and Israel [were] as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; [they] were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
11¿Õ»ó 4:21 Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River [to] the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; [they] brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
11¿Õ»ó 4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour and sixty kors of meal,
11¿Õ»ó 4:23 ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.
11¿Õ»ó 4:24 For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around about him.
11¿Õ»ó 4:25 So Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 4:26 And Solomon had 400000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 120000 horsemen.
11¿Õ»ó 4:27 And those deputies provided for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon's table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking.
11¿Õ»ó 4:28 They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge.
11¿Õ»ó 4:29 Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore.
11¿Õ»ó 4:30 And Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.
11¿Õ»ó 4:31 For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was [known] in all the surrounding nations.
11¿Õ»ó 4:32 He also spoke 30000 proverbs, and his songs were 10055.
11¿Õ»ó 4:33 And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish.
11¿Õ»ó 4:34 And men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 5:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David.
11¿Õ»ó 5:2 Then Solomon sent [word] to Hiram, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 5:3 "You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 5:4 "But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.
11¿Õ»ó 5:5 "And behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he will build the house for My name.'
11¿Õ»ó 5:6 "Now therefore, command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians."
11¿Õ»ó 5:7 And it came about when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the LORD today, who has given to David a wise son over this great people."
11¿Õ»ó 5:8 So Hiram sent [word] to Solomon, saying, "I have heard [the message] which you have sent me; I will do what you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber.
11¿Õ»ó 5:9 "My servants will bring [them] down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts [to go] by sea to the place where you direct me, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall carry [them] away. Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food to my household."
11¿Õ»ó 5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber.
11¿Õ»ó 5:11 Solomon then gave Hiram 200000 kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year.
11¿Õ»ó 5:12 And the LORD gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant.
11¿Õ»ó 5:13 Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 300000 men.
11¿Õ»ó 5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, 100000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month [and] two months at home. And Adoniram [was] over the forced laborers.
11¿Õ»ó 5:15 Now Solomon had 700000 transporters, and 800000 hewers [of stone] in the mountains,
11¿Õ»ó 5:16 besides Solomon's 33000 chief deputies who [were] over the project [ and] who ruled over the people who were doing the work.
11¿Õ»ó 5:17 Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones.
11¿Õ»ó 5:18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:1 Now it came about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 6:2 As for the house which King Solomon built for the LORD, its length [was] sixty cubits and its width twenty [cubits] and its height thirty cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 6:3 And the porch in front of the nave of the house [was] twenty cubits in length, corresponding to the width of the house, [and] its depth along the front of the house [was] ten cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 6:4 Also for the house he made windows with [artistic] frames.
11¿Õ»ó 6:5 And against the wall of the house he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the nave and the inner sanctuary; thus he made side chambers all around.
11¿Õ»ó 6:6 The lowest story [was] five cubits wide, and the middle [was] six cubits wide, and the third [was] seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets [in the wall] of the house all around in order that [the beams] should not be inserted in the walls of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:7 And the house, while it was being built, was built of stone prepared at the quarry, and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house while it was being built.
11¿Õ»ó 6:8 The doorway for the lowest side chamber [was] on the right side of the house; and they would go up by winding stairs to the middle [story,] and from the middle to the third.
11¿Õ»ó 6:9 So he built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:10 He also built the stories against the whole house, each five cubits high; and they were fastened to the house with timbers of cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:11 Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon saying,
11¿Õ»ó 6:12 "[Concerning] this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes and execute My ordinances and keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will carry out My word with you which I spoke to David your father.
11¿Õ»ó 6:13 "And I will dwell among the sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel."
11¿Õ»ó 6:14 So Solomon built the house and finished it.
11¿Õ»ó 6:15 Then he built the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the ceiling he overlaid [the walls] on the inside with wood, and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
11¿Õ»ó 6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built [them] for it on the inside as an inner sanctuary, [even] as the most holy place.
11¿Õ»ó 6:17 And the house, that is, the nave in front of [the inner sanctuary,] was forty cubits [long.]
11¿Õ»ó 6:18 And there was cedar on the house within, carved [in the shape] of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, there was no stone seen.
11¿Õ»ó 6:19 Then he prepared an inner sanctuary within the house in order to place there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 6:20 And the inner sanctuary [was] twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the altar with cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 6:21 So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:22 And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar which was by the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:23 Also in the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
11¿Õ»ó 6:24 And five cubits [was] the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing [were] ten cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 6:25 And the other cherub [was] ten cubits; both the cherubim were of the same measure and the same form.
11¿Õ»ó 6:26 The height of the one cherub [was] ten cubits, and so [was] the other cherub.
11¿Õ»ó 6:27 And he placed the cherubim in the midst of the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that the wing of the one was touching the [one] wall, and the wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall. So their wings were touching each other in the center of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 6:28 He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
11¿Õ»ó 6:29 Then he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inner and outer [sanctuaries.]
11¿Õ»ó 6:30 And he overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inner and outer [ sanctuaries.]
11¿Õ»ó 6:31 And for the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood, the lintel [and] five-sided doorposts.
11¿Õ»ó 6:32 So [he made] two doors of olive wood, and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
11¿Õ»ó 6:33 So also he made for the entrance of the nave four-sided doorposts of olive wood
11¿Õ»ó 6:34 and two doors of cypress wood; the two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots.
11¿Õ»ó 6:35 And he carved [on it] cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid [them] with gold evenly applied on the engraved work.
11¿Õ»ó 6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams.
11¿Õ»ó 6:37 In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.
11¿Õ»ó 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven years in building it.
11¿Õ»ó 7:1 Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
11¿Õ»ó 7:2 And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was 100 cubits and its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars.
11¿Õ»ó 7:3 And it was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row.
11¿Õ»ó 7:4 And [there were artistic window] frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks.
11¿Õ»ó 7:5 And all the doorways and doorposts [had] squared [artistic] frames, and window was opposite window in three ranks.
11¿Õ»ó 7:6 Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was 50 cubits and its width 30 cubits, and a porch [was] in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them.
11¿Õ»ó 7:7 And he made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor.
11¿Õ»ó 7:8 And his house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married.
11¿Õ»ó 7:9 All these were of costly stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.
11¿Õ»ó 7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, [even] large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:11 And above were costly stones, stone cut according to measure, and cedar.
11¿Õ»ó 7:12 So the great court all around [had] three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams even as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the porch of the house.
11¿Õ»ó 7:13 Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
11¿Õ»ó 7:14 He was a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work.
11¿Õ»ó 7:15 And he fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both.
11¿Õ»ó 7:16 He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:17 [There were] nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.
11¿Õ»ó 7:18 So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital.
11¿Õ»ó 7:19 And the capitals which [were] on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:20 And [there were] capitals on the two pillars, even above [and] close to the rounded projection which was beside the network; and the pomegranates [numbered] two hundred in rows around both capitals.
11¿Õ»ó 7:21 Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz.
11¿Õ»ó 7:22 And on the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished.
11¿Õ»ó 7:23 Now he made the sea of cast [metal] ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits, and thirty cubits in circumference.
11¿Õ»ó 7:24 And under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the rest.
11¿Õ»ó 7:25 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea [was set] on top of them, and all their rear parts [turned] inward.
11¿Õ»ó 7:26 And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, [as] a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths.
11¿Õ»ó 7:27 Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits.
11¿Õ»ó 7:28 And this was the design of the stands£º they had borders, even borders between the frames,
11¿Õ»ó 7:29 and on the borders which were between the frames [were] lions, oxen and cherubim; and on the frames there [was] a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen [were] wreaths of hanging work.
11¿Õ»ó 7:30 Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin [were] cast supports with wreaths at each side.
11¿Õ»ó 7:31 And its opening inside the crown at the top [was] a cubit, and its opening [was] round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening [there were] engravings, and their borders were square, not round.
11¿Õ»ó 7:32 And the four wheels [were] underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels [were] on the stand. And the height of a wheel [was] a cubit and a half.
11¿Õ»ó 7:33 And the workmanship of the wheels [was] like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs [were] all cast.
11¿Õ»ó 7:34 Now [there were] four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports [were] part of the stand itself.
11¿Õ»ó 7:35 And on the top of the stand [there was] a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders [were] part of it.
11¿Õ»ó 7:36 And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths [all] around.
11¿Õ»ó 7:37 He made the ten stands like this£º all of them had one casting, one measure and one form.
11¿Õ»ó 7:38 And he made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin [was] four cubits, [and] on each of the ten stands [was] one basin.
11¿Õ»ó 7:39 Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea [of cast metal] on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.
11¿Õ»ó 7:40 Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon [in] the house of the LORD£º
11¿Õ»ó 7:41 the two pillars and the [two] bowls of the capitals which [were] on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which [were] on the top of the pillars;
11¿Õ»ó 7:42 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which [were] on the tops of the pillars;
11¿Õ»ó 7:43 and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands;
11¿Õ»ó 7:44 and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;
11¿Õ»ó 7:45 and the pails and the shovels and the bowls; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon [in] the house of the LORD [were] of polished bronze.
11¿Õ»ó 7:46 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
11¿Õ»ó 7:47 And Solomon left all the utensils [unweighed,] because [they were] too many; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained.
11¿Õ»ó 7:48 And Solomon made all the furniture which [was in] the house of the LORD£º the golden altar and the golden table on which [was] the bread of the Presence;
11¿Õ»ó 7:49 and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, of gold;
11¿Õ»ó 7:50 and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, [and] for the doors of the house, [that is,] of the nave, of gold.
11¿Õ»ó 7:51 Thus all the work that King Solomon performed [in] the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things dedicated by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, [and] he put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' [households] of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion.
11¿Õ»ó 8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
11¿Õ»ó 8:3 Then all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
11¿Õ»ó 8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils, which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites brought them up.
11¿Õ»ó 8:5 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they could not be counted or numbered.
11¿Õ»ó 8:6 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.
11¿Õ»ó 8:7 For the cherubim spread [their] wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles from above.
11¿Õ»ó 8:8 But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; they are there to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 8:9 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
11¿Õ»ó 8:10 And it came about when the priests came from the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
11¿Õ»ó 8:11 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:12 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud.
11¿Õ»ó 8:13 "I have surely built Thee a lofty house, A place for Thy dwelling forever."
11¿Õ»ó 8:14 Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.
11¿Õ»ó 8:15 And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled [it] with His hand, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 8:16 'Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel [in which] to build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be over My people Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:17 "Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 8:18 "But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.
11¿Õ»ó 8:19 'Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:20 "Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 8:21 "And there I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers when He brought them from the land of Egypt."
11¿Õ»ó 8:22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
11¿Õ»ó 8:23 And he said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee in heaven above or on earth beneath, who art keeping covenant and [showing] lovingkindness to Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their heart,
11¿Õ»ó 8:24 who hast kept with Thy servant, my father David, that which Thou hast promised him; indeed, Thou hast spoken with Thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand as it is this day.
11¿Õ»ó 8:25 "Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way to walk before Me as you have walked.'
11¿Õ»ó 8:26 "Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be confirmed which Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, my father David.
11¿Õ»ó 8:27 "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain Thee, how much less this house which I have built!
11¿Õ»ó 8:28 "Yet have regard to the prayer of Thy servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prays before Thee today;
11¿Õ»ó 8:29 that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which Thou hast said, 'My name shall be there,' to listen to the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place.
11¿Õ»ó 8:30 "And listen to the supplication of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place; hear and forgive.
11¿Õ»ó 8:31 "If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes [and] takes an oath before Thine altar in this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:32 then hear Thou in heaven and act and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
11¿Õ»ó 8:33 "When Thy people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against Thee, if they turn to Thee again and confess Thy name and pray and make supplication to Thee in this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:34 then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back to the land which Thou didst give to their fathers.
11¿Õ»ó 8:35 "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against Thee, and they pray toward this place and confess Thy name and turn from their sin when Thou dost afflict them,
11¿Õ»ó 8:36 then hear Thou in heaven and forgive the sin of Thy servants and of Thy people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Thy land, which Thou hast given Thy people for an inheritance.
11¿Õ»ó 8:37 "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight [or] mildew, locust [or] grasshopper, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
11¿Õ»ó 8:38 whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man [or] by all Thy people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading his hands toward this house;
11¿Õ»ó 8:39 then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place, and forgive and act and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest, for Thou alone dost know the hearts of all the sons of men,
11¿Õ»ó 8:40 that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou hast given to our fathers.
11¿Õ»ó 8:41 "Also concerning the foreigner who is not of Thy people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Thy name's sake
11¿Õ»ó 8:42 (for they will hear of Thy great name and Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm); when he comes and prays toward this house,
11¿Õ»ó 8:43 hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to Thee, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as [do] Thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Thy name.
11¿Õ»ó 8:44 "When Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city which Thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for Thy name,
11¿Õ»ó 8:45 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
11¿Õ»ó 8:46 "When they sin against Thee (for there is no man who does not sin) and Thou art angry with them and dost deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;
11¿Õ»ó 8:47 if they take thought in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and make supplication to Thee in the land of those who have taken them captive, saying, 'We have sinned and have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly';
11¿Õ»ó 8:48 if they return to Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to Thee toward their land which Thou hast given to their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name;
11¿Õ»ó 8:49 then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
11¿Õ»ó 8:50 and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against Thee, and make them [objects of] compassion before those who have taken them captive, that they may have compassion on them
11¿Õ»ó 8:51 (for they are Thy people and Thine inheritance which Thou hast brought forth from Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace),
11¿Õ»ó 8:52 that Thine eyes may be open to the supplication of Thy servant and to the supplication of Thy people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to Thee.
11¿Õ»ó 8:53 "For Thou hast separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Thine inheritance, as Thou didst speak through Moses Thy servant, when Thou didst bring our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord GOD."
11¿Õ»ó 8:54 And it came about that when Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread toward heaven.
11¿Õ»ó 8:55 And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 8:56 "Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant.
11¿Õ»ó 8:57 "May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us or forsake us,
11¿Õ»ó 8:58 that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers.
11¿Õ»ó 8:59 "And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as each day requires,
11¿Õ»ó 8:60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no one else.
11¿Õ»ó 8:61 "Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments, as at this day."
11¿Õ»ó 8:62 Now the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:63 And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, 220000 oxen and 1200000 sheep. So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 8:64 On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that [ was] before the house of the LORD, because there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings; for the bronze altar that [was] before the LORD [was] too small to hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings.
11¿Õ»ó 8:65 So Solomon observed the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, for seven days and seven [more] days, [even] fourteen days.
11¿Õ»ó 8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king. Then they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David His servant and to Israel His people.
11¿Õ»ó 9:1 Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all that Solomon desired to do,
11¿Õ»ó 9:2 that the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
11¿Õ»ó 9:3 And the LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.
11¿Õ»ó 9:4 "And as for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you [and] will keep My statutes and My ordinances,
11¿Õ»ó 9:5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, 'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'
11¿Õ»ó 9:6 "But if you or your sons shall indeed turn away from following Me, and shall not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them,
11¿Õ»ó 9:7 then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
11¿Õ»ó 9:8 "And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'
11¿Õ»ó 9:9 "And they will say, 'Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore the LORD has brought all this adversity on them.'"
11¿Õ»ó 9:10 And it came about at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house
11¿Õ»ó 9:11 (Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold according to all his desire), then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
11¿Õ»ó 9:12 So Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.
11¿Õ»ó 9:13 And he said, "What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?" So they were called the land of Cabul to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 9:14 And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
11¿Õ»ó 9:15 Now this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the LORD, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
11¿Õ»ó 9:16 [For] Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer, and burned it with fire, and killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it [as] a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
11¿Õ»ó 9:17 So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and the lower Beth-horon
11¿Õ»ó 9:18 and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land [of Judah,]
11¿Õ»ó 9:19 and all the storage cities which Solomon had, even the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.
11¿Õ»ó 9:20 [As for] all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,
11¿Õ»ó 9:21 their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel were unable to destroy utterly, from them Solomon levied forced laborers, even to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 9:22 But Solomon did not make slaves of the sons of Israel; for they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, his chariot commanders, and his horsemen.
11¿Õ»ó 9:23 These [were] the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people doing the work.
11¿Õ»ó 9:24 As soon as Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her, then he built the Millo.
11¿Õ»ó 9:25 Now three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, burning incense with them [on the altar] which [was] before the LORD. So he finished the house.
11¿Õ»ó 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
11¿Õ»ó 9:27 And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 9:28 And they went to Ophir, and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought [it] to King Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:1 Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions.
11¿Õ»ó 10:2 So she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.
11¿Õ»ó 10:3 And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her.
11¿Õ»ó 10:4 When the queen of Sheba perceived all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
11¿Õ»ó 10:5 the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her.
11¿Õ»ó 10:6 Then she said to the king, "It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:7 "Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You exceed [in] wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard.
11¿Õ»ó 10:8 "How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually [and] hear your wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:9 "Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness."
11¿Õ»ó 10:10 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great [amount] of spices and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:11 And also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir a very great [number of] almug trees and precious stones.
11¿Õ»ó 10:12 And the king made of the almug trees supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not come in [again,] nor have they been seen to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 10:13 And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested, besides what he gave her according to his royal bounty. Then she turned and went to her own land together with her servants.
11¿Õ»ó 10:14 Now the weight of gold which came in to Solomon in one year [was] 666 talents of gold,
11¿Õ»ó 10:15 besides [that] from the traders and the wares of the merchants and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the country.
11¿Õ»ó 10:16 And King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 [ shekels of] gold on each large shield.
11¿Õ»ó 10:17 And [he made] 300 shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:18 Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with refined gold.
11¿Õ»ó 10:19 There [were] six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms.
11¿Õ»ó 10:20 And twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like [it] was made for any other kingdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:21 And all King Solomon's drinking vessels [were] of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were] of pure gold. None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 10:22 For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks.
11¿Õ»ó 10:23 So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
11¿Õ»ó 10:24 And all the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart.
11¿Õ»ó 10:25 And they brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
11¿Õ»ó 10:26 Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had 14000 chariots and 120000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 10:27 And the king made silver [as common] as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland.
11¿Õ»ó 10:28 Also Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's merchants procured [them] from Kue for a price.
11¿Õ»ó 10:29 And a chariot was imported from Egypt for 600 [shekels] of silver, and a horse for 150; and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of the Arameans.
11¿Õ»ó 11:1 Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh£º Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,
11¿Õ»ó 11:2 from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the sons of Israel, "You shall not associate with them, neither shall they associate with you, [for] they will surely turn your heart away after their gods." Solomon held fast to these in love.
11¿Õ»ó 11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart away.
11¿Õ»ó 11:4 For it came about when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father [had been.]
11¿Õ»ó 11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
11¿Õ»ó 11:6 And Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father [had done.]
11¿Õ»ó 11:7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon.
11¿Õ»ó 11:8 Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
11¿Õ»ó 11:9 Now the LORD was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
11¿Õ»ó 11:10 and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not observe what the LORD had commanded.
11¿Õ»ó 11:11 So the LORD said to Solomon, "Because you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.
11¿Õ»ó 11:12 "Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David, [but] I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
11¿Õ»ó 11:13 "However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, [but] I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen."
11¿Õ»ó 11:14 Then the LORD raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal line in Edom.
11¿Õ»ó 11:15 For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom
11¿Õ»ó 11:16 (for Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom),
11¿Õ»ó 11:17 that Hadad fled to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, while Hadad [was] a young boy.
11¿Õ»ó 11:18 And they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him food and gave him land.
11¿Õ»ó 11:19 Now Hadad found great favor before Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
11¿Õ»ó 11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bore his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.
11¿Õ»ó 11:21 But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Send me away, that I may go to my own country."
11¿Õ»ó 11:22 Then Pharaoh said to him, "But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you are seeking to go to your own country?" And he answered, "Nothing; nevertheless you must surely let me go."
11¿Õ»ó 11:23 God also raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
11¿Õ»ó 11:24 And he gathered men to himself and became leader of a marauding band, after David slew them of [Zobah;] and they went to Damascus and stayed there, and reigned in Damascus.
11¿Õ»ó 11:25 So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, along with the evil that Hadad [did;] and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Aram.
11¿Õ»ó 11:26 Then Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.
11¿Õ»ó 11:27 Now this was the reason why he rebelled against the king£º Solomon built the Millo, [and] closed up the breach of the city of his father David.
11¿Õ»ó 11:28 Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.
11¿Õ»ó 11:29 And it came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had clothed himself with a new cloak; and both of them were alone in the field.
11¿Õ»ó 11:30 Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.
11¿Õ»ó 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, "Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes
11¿Õ»ó 11:32 (but he will have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel),
11¿Õ»ó 11:33 because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and [observing] My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David [did.]
11¿Õ»ó 11:34 'Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who observed My commandments and My statutes;
11¿Õ»ó 11:35 but I will take the kingdom from his son's hand and give it to you, [even] ten tribes.
11¿Õ»ó 11:36 'But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name.
11¿Õ»ó 11:37 'And I will take you, and you shall reign over whatever you desire, and you shall be king over Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 11:38 'Then it will be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by observing My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
11¿Õ»ó 11:39 'Thus I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not always.' "
11¿Õ»ó 11:40 Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 11:41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and whatever he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
11¿Õ»ó 11:42 Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
11¿Õ»ó 11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 12:1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
11¿Õ»ó 12:2 Now it came about when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard [of it,] that he was living in Egypt (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon).
11¿Õ»ó 12:3 Then they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 12:4 "Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you."
11¿Õ»ó 12:5 Then he said to them, "Depart for three days, then return to me." So the people departed.
11¿Õ»ó 12:6 And King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you counsel [me] to answer this people?"
11¿Õ»ó 12:7 Then they spoke to him, saying, "If you will be a servant to this people today, will serve them, grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
11¿Õ»ó 12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him.
11¿Õ»ó 12:9 So he said to them, "What counsel do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, 'Lighten the yoke which your father put on us'?"
11¿Õ»ó 12:10 And the young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!' But you shall speak to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins!
11¿Õ»ó 12:11 'Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.' "
11¿Õ»ó 12:12 Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, "Return to me on the third day."
11¿Õ»ó 12:13 And the king answered the people harshly, for he forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him,
11¿Õ»ó 12:14 and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions."
11¿Õ»ó 12:15 So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a turn [of events] from the LORD, that He might establish His word, which the LORD spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
11¿Õ»ó 12:16 When all Israel [saw] that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion do we have in David? [We have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse; To your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own house, David!" So Israel departed to their tents.
11¿Õ»ó 12:17 But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
11¿Õ»ó 12:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 12:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
11¿Õ»ó 12:20 And it came about when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None but the tribe of Judah followed the house of David.
11¿Õ»ó 12:21 Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 1800000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
11¿Õ»ó 12:22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 12:23 "Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 12:24 'Thus says the LORD, "You must not go up and fight against your relatives the sons of Israel; return every man to his house, for this thing has come from Me."' "So they listened to the word of the LORD, and returned and went [their way] according to the word of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel.
11¿Õ»ó 12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
11¿Õ»ó 12:27 "If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord, [even] to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah."
11¿Õ»ó 12:28 So the king consulted, and made two golden calves, and he said to them, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt."
11¿Õ»ó 12:29 And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
11¿Õ»ó 12:30 Now this thing became a sin, for the people went [to worship] before the one as far as Dan.
11¿Õ»ó 12:31 And he made houses on high places, and made priests from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.
11¿Õ»ó 12:32 And Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; thus he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
11¿Õ»ó 12:33 Then he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised in his own heart; and he instituted a feast for the sons of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.
11¿Õ»ó 13:1 Now behold, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
11¿Õ»ó 13:2 And he cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, " O altar, altar, thus says the LORD, 'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.' "
11¿Õ»ó 13:3 Then he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign which the LORD has spoken, 'Behold, the altar shall be split apart and the ashes which are on it shall be poured out.'"
11¿Õ»ó 13:4 Now it came about when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, "Seize him." But his hand which he stretched out against him dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
11¿Õ»ó 13:5 The altar also was split apart and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 13:6 And the king answered and said to the man of God, "Please entreat the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.
11¿Õ»ó 13:7 Then the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward."
11¿Õ»ó 13:8 But the man of God said to the king, "If you were to give me half your house I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.
11¿Õ»ó 13:9 "For so it was commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way which you came.'"
11¿Õ»ó 13:10 So he went another way, and did not return by the way which he came to Bethel.
11¿Õ»ó 13:11 Now an old prophet was living in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words which he had spoken to the king, these also they related to their father.
11¿Õ»ó 13:12 And their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" Now his sons had seen the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
11¿Õ»ó 13:13 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they saddled the donkey for him and he rode away on it.
11¿Õ»ó 13:14 So he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And he said, "I am."
11¿Õ»ó 13:15 Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread."
11¿Õ»ó 13:16 And he said, "I cannot return with you, nor go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
11¿Õ»ó 13:17 "For a command [came] to me by the word of the LORD, 'You shall eat no bread, nor drink water there; do not return by going the way which you came.'"
11¿Õ»ó 13:18 And he said to him, "I also am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.'" [But] he lied to him.
11¿Õ»ó 13:19 So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house and drank water.
11¿Õ»ó 13:20 Now it came about, as they were sitting down at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back;
11¿Õ»ó 13:21 and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have disobeyed the command of the LORD, and have not observed the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,
11¿Õ»ó 13:22 but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which He said to you, "Eat no bread and drink no water"; your body shall not come to the grave of your fathers. '"
11¿Õ»ó 13:23 And it came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
11¿Õ»ó 13:24 Now when he had gone, a lion met him on the way and killed him, and his body was thrown on the road, with the donkey standing beside it; the lion also was standing beside the body.
11¿Õ»ó 13:25 And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the road, and the lion standing beside the body; so they came and told [it] in the city where the old prophet lived.
11¿Õ»ó 13:26 Now when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard [it,] he said, "It is the man of God, who disobeyed the command of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him."
11¿Õ»ó 13:27 Then he spoke to his sons, saying, "Saddle the donkey for me." And they saddled [it.]
11¿Õ»ó 13:28 And he went and found his body thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the body; the lion had not eaten the body nor torn the donkey.
11¿Õ»ó 13:29 So the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back and he came to the city of the old prophet to mourn and to bury him.
11¿Õ»ó 13:30 And he laid his body in his own grave, and they mourned over him, [ saying,] "Alas, my brother!"
11¿Õ»ó 13:31 And it came about after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, "When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
11¿Õ»ó 13:32 "For the thing shall surely come to pass which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria."
11¿Õ»ó 13:33 After this event Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again he made priests of the high places from among all the people; any who would, he ordained, to be priests of the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 13:34 And this event became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to blot [ it] out and destroy [it] from off the face of the earth.
11¿Õ»ó 14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.
11¿Õ»ó 14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, "Arise now, and disguise yourself so that they may not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me [that I would be] king over this people.
11¿Õ»ó 14:3 "And take ten loaves with you, [some] cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."
11¿Õ»ó 14:4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
11¿Õ»ó 14:5 Now the LORD had said to Ahijah, "Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. You shall say thus and thus to her, for it will be when she arrives that she will pretend to be another woman."
11¿Õ»ó 14:6 And it came about when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, that he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam, why do you pretend to be another woman? For I am sent to you [with] a harsh [message.]
11¿Õ»ó 14:7 "Go, say to Jeroboam, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel," Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over My people Israel,
11¿Õ»ó 14:8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you-- yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in My sight;
11¿Õ»ó 14:9 you also have done more evil than all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back--
11¿Õ»ó 14:10 therefore behold, I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone.
11¿Õ»ó 14:11 "Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat. And he who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat; for the LORD has spoken [it.]" '
11¿Õ»ó 14:12 "Now you arise, go to your house. When your feet enter the city the child will die.
11¿Õ»ó 14:13 "And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam's [family] shall come to the grave, because in him something good was found toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
11¿Õ»ó 14:14 "Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and from now on.
11¿Õ»ó 14:15 "For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the [Euphrates] River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger.
11¿Õ»ó 14:16 "And He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam, which he committed and with which he made Israel to sin."
11¿Õ»ó 14:17 Then Jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the child died.
11¿Õ»ó 14:18 And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.
11¿Õ»ó 14:19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 14:20 And the time that Jeroboam reigned [was] twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 14:21 Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
11¿Õ»ó 14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers had done, with the sins which they committed.
11¿Õ»ó 14:23 For they also built for themselves high places and [sacred] pillars and Asherim on every high hill and beneath every luxuriant tree.
11¿Õ»ó 14:24 And there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 14:25 Now it came about in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
11¿Õ»ó 14:26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house, and he took everything, even taking all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
11¿Õ»ó 14:27 So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the doorway of the king's house.
11¿Õ»ó 14:28 Then it happened as often as the king entered the house of the LORD, that the guards would carry them and would bring them back into the guards' room.
11¿Õ»ó 14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
11¿Õ»ó 14:30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
11¿Õ»ó 14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
11¿Õ»ó 15:3 And he walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, like the heart of his father David.
11¿Õ»ó 15:4 But for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem;
11¿Õ»ó 15:5 because David did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
11¿Õ»ó 15:6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
11¿Õ»ó 15:7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
11¿Õ»ó 15:8 And Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 15:9 So in the twentieth year of Jeroboam the king of Israel, Asa began to reign as king of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:10 And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
11¿Õ»ó 15:11 And Asa did what was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father.
11¿Õ»ó 15:12 He also put away the male cult prostitutes from the land, and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.
11¿Õ»ó 15:13 And he also removed Maacah his mother from [being] queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah; and Asa cut down her horrid image and burned [it] at the brook Kidron.
11¿Õ»ó 15:14 But the high places were not taken away; nevertheless the heart of Asa was wholly devoted to the LORD all his days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:15 And he brought into the house of the LORD the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things£º silver and gold and utensils.
11¿Õ»ó 15:16 Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent [anyone] from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold which were left in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the treasuries of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 15:19 "[Let there be] a treaty between you and me, [as] between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me."
11¿Õ»ó 15:20 So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah and all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali.
11¿Õ»ó 15:21 And it came about when Baasha heard [of it] that he ceased fortifying Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:22 Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah-- none was exempt-- and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built. And King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
11¿Õ»ó 15:23 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
11¿Õ»ó 15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 15:25 Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
11¿Õ»ó 15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father and in his sin which he made Israel sin.
11¿Õ»ó 15:27 Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
11¿Õ»ó 15:28 So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 15:29 And it came about, as soon as he was king, he struck down all the household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam any persons alive, until he had destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
11¿Õ»ó 15:30 [and] because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
11¿Õ»ó 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
11¿Õ»ó 15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah, [and reigned] twenty-four years.
11¿Õ»ó 15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel sin.
11¿Õ»ó 16:1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 16:2 "Inasmuch as I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins,
11¿Õ»ó 16:3 behold, I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
11¿Õ»ó 16:4 "Anyone of Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat."
11¿Õ»ó 16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:6 And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 16:7 Moreover, the word of the LORD through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani also came against Baasha and his household, both because of all the evil which he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it.
11¿Õ»ó 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah, [and reigned] two years.
11¿Õ»ó 16:9 And his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he [was] at Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who [was] over the household at Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 16:10 Then Zimri went in and struck him and put him to death, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 16:11 And it came about, when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.
11¿Õ»ó 16:12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,
11¿Õ»ó 16:13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.
11¿Õ»ó 16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah. Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
11¿Õ»ó 16:16 And the people who were camped heard it said, "Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king." Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
11¿Õ»ó 16:17 Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 16:18 And it came about, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire, and died,
11¿Õ»ó 16:19 because of his sins which he sinned, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel sin.
11¿Õ»ó 16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:21 Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts£º half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; the [other] half followed Omri.
11¿Õ»ó 16:22 But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king.
11¿Õ»ó 16:23 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years; he reigned six years at Tirzah.
11¿Õ»ó 16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
11¿Õ»ó 16:25 And Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, and acted more wickedly than all who [were] before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel with their idols.
11¿Õ»ó 16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 16:28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 16:29 Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
11¿Õ»ó 16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more than all who were before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:31 And it came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went to serve Baal and worshiped him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:32 So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 16:33 And Ahab also made the Asherah. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
11¿Õ»ó 16:34 In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho; he laid its foundations with the [loss of] Abiram his first-born, and set up its gates with the [loss of] his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.
11¿Õ»ó 17:1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, surely there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word."
11¿Õ»ó 17:2 And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 17:3 "Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
11¿Õ»ó 17:4 "And it shall be that you shall drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide for you there."
11¿Õ»ó 17:5 So he went and did according to the word of the LORD, for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
11¿Õ»ó 17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook.
11¿Õ»ó 17:7 And it happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
11¿Õ»ó 17:8 Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 17:9 "Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you."
11¿Õ»ó 17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, "Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink."
11¿Õ»ó 17:11 And as she was going to get [it,] he called to her and said, "Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand."
11¿Õ»ó 17:12 But she said, "As the LORD your God lives, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar; and behold, I am gathering a few sticks that I may go in and prepare for me and my son, that we may eat it and die."
11¿Õ»ó 17:13 Then Elijah said to her, "Do not fear; go, do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first, and bring [it] out to me, and afterward you may make [one] for yourself and for your son.
11¿Õ»ó 17:14 "For thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'The bowl of flour shall not be exhausted, nor shall the jar of oil be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the face of the earth.'"
11¿Õ»ó 17:15 So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and she and he and her household ate for [many] days.
11¿Õ»ó 17:16 The bowl of flour was not exhausted nor did the jar of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke through Elijah.
11¿Õ»ó 17:17 Now it came about after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.
11¿Õ»ó 17:18 So she said to Elijah, "What do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance, and to put my son to death!"
11¿Õ»ó 17:19 And he said to her, "Give me your son." Then he took him from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and laid him on his own bed.
11¿Õ»ó 17:20 And he called to the LORD and said, "O LORD my God, hast Thou also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?"
11¿Õ»ó 17:21 Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and called to the LORD, and said, "O LORD my God, I pray Thee, let this child's life return to him."
11¿Õ»ó 17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned to him and he revived.
11¿Õ»ó 17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the upper room into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, "See, your son is alive."
11¿Õ»ó 17:24 Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."
11¿Õ»ó 18:1 Now it came about [after] many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth."
11¿Õ»ó 18:2 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine [was] severe in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah who [was] over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly;
11¿Õ»ó 18:4 for it came about, when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)
11¿Õ»ó 18:5 Then Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and not have to kill some of the cattle."
11¿Õ»ó 18:6 So they divided the land between them to survey it; Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself.
11¿Õ»ó 18:7 Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, "Is this you, Elijah my master?"
11¿Õ»ó 18:8 And he said to him, "It is I. Go, say to your master, 'Behold, Elijah [is here].'"
11¿Õ»ó 18:9 And he said, "What sin have I committed, that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death?
11¿Õ»ó 18:10 "As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you; and when they said, 'He is not [here],' he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.
11¿Õ»ó 18:11 "And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master," Behold, Elijah [ is here]. "'
11¿Õ»ó 18:12 "And it will come about when I leave you that the Spirit of the LORD will carry you where I do not know; so when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although [I] your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.
11¿Õ»ó 18:13 "Has it not been told to my master what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, that I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water?
11¿Õ»ó 18:14 "And now you are saying, 'Go, say to your master," Behold, Elijah [ is here] "';he will then kill me."
11¿Õ»ó 18:15 And Elijah said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today."
11¿Õ»ó 18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
11¿Õ»ó 18:17 And it came about, when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said to him, "Is this you, you troubler of Israel?"
11¿Õ»ó 18:18 And he said, "I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house [have], because you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed the Baals.
11¿Õ»ó 18:19 "Now then send [and] gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, [together] with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
11¿Õ»ó 18:20 So Ahab sent [a message] among all the sons of Israel, and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
11¿Õ»ó 18:21 And Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long [will] you hesitate between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." But the people did not answer him a word.
11¿Õ»ó 18:22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I alone am left a prophet of the LORD ,but Baal's prophets are 450 men.
11¿Õ»ó 18:23 "Now let them give us two oxen; and let them choose one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire [under it]; and I will prepare the other ox, and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire [under it.]
11¿Õ»ó 18:24 "Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, He is God." And all the people answered and said, "That is a good idea."
11¿Õ»ó 18:25 So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many, and call on the name of your god, but put no fire [under it]."
11¿Õ»ó 18:26 Then they took the ox which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon saying, "O Baal, answer us." But there was no voice and no one answered. And they leaped about the altar which they made.
11¿Õ»ó 18:27 And it came about at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, "Call out with a loud voice, for he is a god; either he is occupied or gone aside, or is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and needs to be awakened."
11¿Õ»ó 18:28 So they cried with a loud voice and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out on them.
11¿Õ»ó 18:29 And it came about when midday was past, that they raved until the time of the offering of the [evening] sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and no one paid attention.
11¿Õ»ó 18:30 Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me." So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD which had been torn down.
11¿Õ»ó 18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Israel shall be your name."
11¿Õ»ó 18:32 So with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two measures of seed.
11¿Õ»ó 18:33 Then he arranged the wood and cut the ox in pieces and laid [it] on the wood. And he said, "Fill four pitchers with water and pour [it] on the burnt offering and on the wood."
11¿Õ»ó 18:34 And he said, "Do it a second time," and they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time," and they did it a third time.
11¿Õ»ó 18:35 And the water flowed around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.
11¿Õ»ó 18:36 Then it came about at the time of the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, "O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that I have done all these things at Thy word.
11¿Õ»ó 18:37 "Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that Thou, O LORD, art God, and [that] Thou hast turned their heart back again."
11¿Õ»ó 18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
11¿Õ»ó 18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, "The LORD, He is God; the LORD, He is God."
11¿Õ»ó 18:40 Then Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape." So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
11¿Õ»ó 18:41 Now Elijah said to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a [heavy] shower."
11¿Õ»ó 18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he crouched down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.
11¿Õ»ó 18:43 And he said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea." So he went up and looked and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go back" seven times.
11¿Õ»ó 18:44 And it came about at the seventh [time,] that he said, "Behold, a cloud as small as a man's hand is coming up from the sea." And he said, "Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare [your chariot] and go down, so that the [heavy] shower does not stop you.'"
11¿Õ»ó 18:45 So it came about in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
11¿Õ»ó 18:46 Then the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and outran Ahab to Jezreel.
11¿Õ»ó 19:1 Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
11¿Õ»ó 19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time."
11¿Õ»ó 19:3 And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
11¿Õ»ó 19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am not better than my fathers."
11¿Õ»ó 19:5 And he lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, "Arise, eat."
11¿Õ»ó 19:6 Then he looked and behold, there was at his head a bread cake [baked on] hot stones, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again.
11¿Õ»ó 19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, "Arise, eat, because the journey is too great for you."
11¿Õ»ó 19:8 So he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.
11¿Õ»ó 19:9 Then he came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD [came] to him, and He said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:10 And he said, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, torn down Thine altars and killed Thy prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11¿Õ»ó 19:11 So He said, "Go forth, and stand on the mountain before the LORD." And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the LORD; [but] the LORD [was] not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, [but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake.
11¿Õ»ó 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire, [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing.
11¿Õ»ó 19:13 And it came about when Elijah heard [it,] that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice [came] to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:14 Then he said, "I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, torn down Thine altars and killed Thy prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11¿Õ»ó 19:15 And the LORD said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram;
11¿Õ»ó 19:16 and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
11¿Õ»ó 19:17 "And it shall come about, the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.
11¿Õ»ó 19:18 "Yet I will leave 70000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him."
11¿Õ»ó 19:19 So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, while he was plowing with twelve pairs [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed over to him and threw his mantle on him.
11¿Õ»ó 19:20 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you." And he said to him, "Go back again, for what have I done to you?"
11¿Õ»ó 19:21 So he returned from following him, and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave [it] to the people and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah and ministered to him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:1 Now Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army, and there [were] thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
11¿Õ»ó 20:2 Then he sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, "Thus says Ben-hadad,
11¿Õ»ó 20:3 'Your silver and your gold are mine; your most beautiful wives and children are also mine.' "
11¿Õ»ó 20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, "It is according to your word, my lord, O king; I am yours, and all that I have."
11¿Õ»ó 20:5 Then the messengers returned and said, "Thus says Ben-hadad, 'Surely, I sent to you saying," You shall give me your silver and your gold and your wives and your children, "
11¿Õ»ó 20:6 but about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will search your house and the houses of your servants; and it shall come about, whatever is desirable in your eyes, they will take in their hand and carry away. '"
11¿Õ»ó 20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, "Please observe and see how this man is looking for trouble; for he sent to me for my wives and my children and my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him."
11¿Õ»ó 20:8 And all the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not listen or consent."
11¿Õ»ó 20:9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, "Tell my lord the king, ' All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do, but this thing I cannot do. '"And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
11¿Õ»ó 20:10 And Ben-hadad sent to him and said, "May the gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me."
11¿Õ»ó 20:11 Then the king of Israel answered and said, "Tell [him,] 'Let not him who girds on [his armor] boast like him who takes [it] off.'"
11¿Õ»ó 20:12 And it came about when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking with the kings in the temporary shelters, that he said to his servants, "Station [yourselves]." So they stationed [themselves] against the city.
11¿Õ»ó 20:13 Now behold, a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, " Thus says the LORD, 'Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the LORD.' "
11¿Õ»ó 20:14 And Ahab said, "By whom?" So he said, "Thus says the LORD, 'By the young men of the rulers of the provinces.'" Then he said, "Who shall begin the battle?" And he answered, "You."
11¿Õ»ó 20:15 Then he mustered the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and there were 232; and after them he mustered all the people, [even] all the sons of Israel, 70000.
11¿Õ»ó 20:16 And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the temporary shelters with the thirty-two kings who helped him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:17 And the young men of the rulers of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out and they told him, saying, "Men have come out from Samaria."
11¿Õ»ó 20:18 Then he said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive."
11¿Õ»ó 20:19 So these went out from the city, the young men of the rulers of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
11¿Õ»ó 20:20 And they killed each his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen.
11¿Õ»ó 20:21 And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Arameans with a great slaughter.
11¿Õ»ó 20:22 Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, "Go, strengthen yourself and observe and see what you have to do; for at the turn of the year the king of Aram will come up against you."
11¿Õ»ó 20:23 Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him, "Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we; but rather let us fight against them in the plain, [and] surely we shall be stronger than they.
11¿Õ»ó 20:24 "And do this thing£º remove the kings, each from his place, and put captains in their place,
11¿Õ»ó 20:25 and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. "And he listened to their voice and did so.
11¿Õ»ó 20:26 So it came about at the turn of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 20:27 And the sons of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went to meet them; and the sons of Israel camped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the country.
11¿Õ»ó 20:28 Then a man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because the Arameans have said," The LORD is a god of [the] mountains, but He is not a god of [the] valleys "; therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.'"
11¿Õ»ó 20:29 So they camped one over against the other seven days. And it came about that on the seventh day, the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel killed [of] the Arameans 1000000 foot soldiers in one day.
11¿Õ»ó 20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell on 270000 men who were left. And Ben-hadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber.
11¿Õ»ó 20:31 And his servants said to him, "Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings, please let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save your life."
11¿Õ»ó 20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let me live.'" And he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
11¿Õ»ó 20:33 Now the men took this as an omen, and quickly catching his word said, "Your brother Ben-hadad." Then he said, "Go, bring him." Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he took him up into the chariot.
11¿Õ»ó 20:34 And [Ben-hadad] said to him, "The cities which my father took from your father I will restore, and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria." [Ahab said,] "And I will let you go with this covenant." So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
11¿Õ»ó 20:35 Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of the LORD, "Please strike me." But the man refused to strike him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:36 Then he said to him, "Because you have not listened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you." And as soon as he had departed from him a lion found him, and killed him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:37 Then he found another man and said, "Please strike me." And the man struck him, wounding him.
11¿Õ»ó 20:38 So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.
11¿Õ»ó 20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, "Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man; if for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'
11¿Õ»ó 20:40 "And while your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." And the king of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided [it]."
11¿Õ»ó 20:41 Then he hastily took the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was of the prophets.
11¿Õ»ó 20:42 And he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have let go out of [your] hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.'"
11¿Õ»ó 20:43 So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and vexed, and came to Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 21:1 Now it came about after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which [was] in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 21:2 And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, "Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard than it in its place; if you like, I will give you the price of it in money."
11¿Õ»ó 21:3 But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."
11¿Õ»ó 21:4 So Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food.
11¿Õ»ó 21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, "How is it that your spirit is so sullen that you are not eating food?"
11¿Õ»ó 21:6 So he said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
11¿Õ»ó 21:7 And Jezebel his wife said to him, "Do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11¿Õ»ó 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and sent letters to the elders and to the nobles who were living with Naboth in his city.
11¿Õ»ó 21:9 Now she wrote in the letters, saying, "Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the people;
11¿Õ»ó 21:10 and seat two worthless men before him, and let them testify against him, saying, 'You cursed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death. "
11¿Õ»ó 21:11 So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent [word] to them, just as it was written in the letters which she had sent them.
11¿Õ»ó 21:12 They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people.
11¿Õ»ó 21:13 Then the two worthless men came in and sat before him; and the worthless men testified against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.
11¿Õ»ó 21:14 Then they sent [word] to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned, and is dead."
11¿Õ»ó 21:15 And it came about when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11¿Õ»ó 21:16 And it came about when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
11¿Õ»ó 21:17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 21:18 "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it.
11¿Õ»ó 21:19 "And you shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD," Have you murdered, and also taken possession? "'And you shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the LORD," In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth the dogs shall lick up your blood, even yours. "'"
11¿Õ»ó 21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" And he answered, "I have found [you,] because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD.
11¿Õ»ó 21:21 "Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free in Israel;
11¿Õ»ó 21:22 and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked [Me] to anger, and [because] you have made Israel sin.
11¿Õ»ó 21:23 "And of Jezebel also has the LORD spoken, saying, 'The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.'
11¿Õ»ó 21:24 "The one belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs shall eat, and the one who dies in the field the birds of heaven shall eat."
11¿Õ»ó 21:25 Surely there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD, because Jezebel his wife incited him.
11¿Õ»ó 21:26 And he acted very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 21:27 And it came about when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently.
11¿Õ»ó 21:28 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
11¿Õ»ó 21:29 "Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days, [but] I will bring the evil upon his house in his son's days."
11¿Õ»ó 22:1 And three years passed without war between Aram and Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:2 And it came about in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:3 Now the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we are still doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:4 And he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
11¿Õ»ó 22:5 Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the LORD."
11¿Õ»ó 22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for the Lord will give [it] into the hand of the king."
11¿Õ»ó 22:7 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of him?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. [He is] Micaiah son of Imlah." But Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king say so."
11¿Õ»ó 22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah."
11¿Õ»ó 22:10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in [their] robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
11¿Õ»ó 22:11 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are consumed.'"
11¿Õ»ó 22:12 And all the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will give [it] into the hand of the king."
11¿Õ»ó 22:13 Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, "Behold now, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
11¿Õ»ó 22:14 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak."
11¿Õ»ó 22:15 When he came to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?" And he answered him, " Go up and succeed, and the LORD will give [it] into the hand of the king. "
11¿Õ»ó 22:16 Then the king said to him, "How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:17 So he said, "I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'"
11¿Õ»ó 22:18 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:19 And Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.
11¿Õ»ó 22:20 "And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this while another said that.
11¿Õ»ó 22:21 "Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ' I will entice him. '
11¿Õ»ó 22:22 "And the LORD said to him, 'How?' And he said, 'I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then He said, ' You are to entice [him] and also prevail. Go and do so. '
11¿Õ»ó 22:23 "Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you."
11¿Õ»ó 22:24 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?"
11¿Õ»ó 22:25 And Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself."
11¿Õ»ó 22:26 Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son;
11¿Õ»ó 22:27 and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this man in prison, and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely."' "
11¿Õ»ó 22:28 And Micaiah said, "If you indeed return safely the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Listen, all you people."
11¿Õ»ó 22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead.
11¿Õ»ó 22:30 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
11¿Õ»ó 22:31 Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone."
11¿Õ»ó 22:32 So it came about, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, "Surely it is the king of Israel," and they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.
11¿Õ»ó 22:33 Then it happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
11¿Õ»ó 22:34 Now a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around, and take me out of the fight; for I am severely wounded."
11¿Õ»ó 22:35 And the battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot in front of the Arameans, and died at evening, and the blood from the wound ran into the bottom of the chariot.
11¿Õ»ó 22:36 Then a cry passed throughout the army close to sunset, saying, "Every man to his city and every man to his country."
11¿Õ»ó 22:37 So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
11¿Õ»ó 22:38 And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots bathed themselves [there]), according to the word of the LORD which He spoke.
11¿Õ»ó 22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
11¿Õ»ó 22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 22:41 Now Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
11¿Õ»ó 22:43 And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD. However, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
11¿Õ»ó 22:44 Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might which he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
11¿Õ»ó 22:46 And the remnant of the sodomites who remained in the days of his father Asa, he expelled from the land.
11¿Õ»ó 22:47 Now there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
11¿Õ»ó 22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
11¿Õ»ó 22:49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat was not willing.
11¿Õ»ó 22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place.
11¿Õ»ó 22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
11¿Õ»ó 22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
11¿Õ»ó 22:53 So he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger according to all that his father had done.
12
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:1 Now Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:2 And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber which [was] in Samaria, and became ill. So he sent messengers and said to them, "Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel [that] you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?'
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:4 "Now therefore thus says the LORD, 'You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you shall surely die.'" Then Elijah departed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:5 When the messengers returned to him he said to them, "Why have you returned?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:6 And they said to him, "A man came up to meet us and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him," Thus says the LORD,' Is it because there is no God in Israel [that] you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.' "'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:7 And he said to them, "What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:8 And they answered him, "[He was] a hairy man with a leather girdle bound about his loins." And he said, "It is Elijah the Tishbite."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:9 Then [the king] sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, "O man of God, the king says, 'Come down.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:11 So he again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, "O man of God, thus says the king, 'Come down quickly.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:12 And Elijah answered and said to them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:13 So he again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before Elijah, and begged him and said to him, "O man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:14 "Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight."
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:15 And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:16 Then he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron-- is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?-- therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall surely die.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:17 So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:1 And it came about when the LORD was about to take up Elijah by a whirlwind to heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:2 And Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here please, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel." But Elisha said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:3 Then the sons of the prophets who [were at] Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?" And he said, "Yes, I know; be still."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:4 And Elijah said to him, "Elisha, please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:5 And the sons of the prophets who [were] at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, "Do you know that the LORD will take away your master from over you today?" And he answered, "Yes, I know; be still."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:6 Then Elijah said to him, "Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:7 Now fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite [ them] at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:8 And Elijah took his mantle and folded it together and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:9 Now it came about when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you." And Elisha said, "Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:10 And he said, "You have asked a hard thing. [Nevertheless,] if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be [so.]"
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:11 Then it came about as they were going along and talking, that behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:12 And Elisha saw [it] and cried out, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:13 He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters and said, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" And when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha crossed over.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:15 Now when the sons of the prophets who [were] at Jericho opposite [ him] saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:16 And they said to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men, please let them go and search for your master; perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley." And he said, "You shall not send."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:17 But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched three days, but did not find him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:18 And they returned to him while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:19 Then the men of the city said to Elisha, "Behold now, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful."
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:20 And he said, "Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it." So they brought [it] to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:21 And he went out to the spring of water, and threw salt in it and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'I have purified these waters; there shall not be from there death or unfruitfulness any longer.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:22 So the waters have been purified to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:23 Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him, " Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead! "
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:24 When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of their number.
12¿ÕÇÏ 2:25 And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and his mother; for he put away the [sacred] pillar of Baal which his father had made.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:3 Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:4 Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and used to pay the king of Israel 1000000 lambs and the wool of 1000000 rams.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:5 But it came about, when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:6 And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:7 Then he went and sent [word] to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" And he said, "I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:8 And he said, "Which way shall we go up?" And he answered, "The way of the wilderness of Edom."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:9 So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:10 Then the king of Israel said, "Alas! For the LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD by him?" And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, "Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:13 Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother." And the king of Israel said to him, "No, for the LORD has called these three kings [together] to give them into the hand of Moab."
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:14 And Elisha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:15 "But now bring me a minstrel." And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:16 And he said, "Thus says the LORD, 'Make this valley full of trenches.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:17 "For thus says the LORD, 'You shall not see wind nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, both you and your cattle and your beasts.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:18 'And this is but a slight thing in the sight of the LORD; He shall also give the Moabites into your hand.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:19 'Then you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:20 And it happened in the morning about the time of offering the sacrifice, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:21 Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. And all who were able to put on armor and older were summoned, and stood on the border.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:22 And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite [them] as red as blood.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:23 Then they said, "This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and they have slain one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land, slaughtering the Moabites.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:25 Thus they destroyed the cities; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and filled it. So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth [only] they left its stones; however, the slingers went about [it] and struck it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him 700 men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.
12¿ÕÇÏ 3:27 Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:1 Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD; and the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:2 And Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" And she said, "Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:3 Then he said, "Go, borrow vessels at large for yourself from all your neighbors, [even] empty vessels; do not get a few.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:4 "And you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour out into all these vessels; and you shall set aside what is full."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:5 So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons; they were bringing [the vessels] to her and she poured.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:6 And it came about when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." And he said to her, "There is not one vessel more." And the oil stopped.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debt, and you [and] your sons can live on the rest."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:8 Now there came a day when Elisha passed over to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she persuaded him to eat food. And so it was, as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat food.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:9 And she said to her husband, "Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God passing by us continually.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:10 "Please, let us make a little walled upper chamber and let us set a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, when he comes to us, [that] he can turn in there."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:11 One day he came there and turned in to the upper chamber and rested.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:12 Then he said to Gehazi his servant, "Call this Shunammite." And when he had called her, she stood before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:13 And he said to him, "Say now to her, 'Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what can I do for you? Would you be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the army?'" And she answered, "I live among my own people."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:14 So he said, "What then is to be done for her?" And Gehazi answered, " Truly she has no son and her husband is old. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:15 And he said, "Call her." When he had called her, she stood in the doorway.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:16 Then he said, "At this season next year you shall embrace a son." And she said, "No, my lord, O man of God, do not lie to your maidservant."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:17 And the woman conceived and bore a son at that season the next year, as Elisha had said to her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:18 When the child was grown, the day came that he went out to his father to the reapers.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:19 And he said to his father, "My head, my head." And he said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:20 When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and [then] died.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:21 And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] behind him, and went out.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:22 Then she called to her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and return."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:23 And he said, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." And she said, "[It will be] well."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:24 Then she saddled a donkey and said to her servant, "Drive and go forward; do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:25 So she went and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came about when the man of God saw her at a distance, that he said to Gehazi his servant, "Behold, yonder is the Shunammite.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:26 "Please run now to meet her and say to her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'" And she answered, " It is well. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:27 When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, "Let her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:28 Then she said, "Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand, and go your way; if you meet any man, do not salute him, and if anyone salutes you, do not answer him; and lay my staff on the lad's face."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:30 And the mother of the lad said, "As the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." And he arose and followed her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:31 Then Gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff on the lad's face, but there was neither sound nor response. So he returned to meet him and told him, "The lad has not awakened."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:32 When Elisha came into the house, behold the lad was dead and laid on his bed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:33 So he entered and shut the door behind them both, and prayed to the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:34 And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child became warm.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:35 Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth, and went up and stretched himself on him; and the lad sneezed seven times and the lad opened his eyes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:36 And he called Gehazi and said, "Call this Shunammite." So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, "Take up your son."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:37 Then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground, and she took up her son and went out.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:38 When Elisha returned to Gilgal, [there was] a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, " Put on the large pot and boil stew for the sons of the prophets. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:39 Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, for they did not know [what they were.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:40 So they poured [it] out for the men to eat. And it came about as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out and said, "O man of God, there is death in the pot." And they were unable to eat.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:41 But he said, "Now bring meal." And he threw it into the pot, and he said, "Pour [it] out for the people that they may eat." Then there was no harm in the pot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:42 Now a man came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, "Give [them] to the people that they may eat."
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:43 And his attendant said, "What, shall I set this before a hundred men?" But he said, "Give [them] to the people that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and have [some] left over.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 4:44 So he set [it] before them, and they ate and had [some] left over, according to the word of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man with his master, and highly respected, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man was also a valiant warrior, [but he was] a leper.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:2 Now the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had taken captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:3 And she said to her mistress, "I wish that my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:4 And Naaman went in and told his master, saying, "Thus and thus spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:5 Then the king of Aram said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel." And he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand [shekels] of gold and ten changes of clothes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "And now as this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:7 And it came about when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending [word] to me to cure a man of his leprosy? But consider now, and see how he is seeking a quarrel against me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:8 And it happened when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent [word] to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes? Now let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you and [you shall] be clean."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:11 But Naaman was furious and went away and said, "Behold, I thought, ' He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper. '
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:12 "Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:13 Then his servants came near and spoke to him and said, "My father, had the prophet told you [to do some] great thing, would you not have done [ it]? How much more [then,] when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:14 So he went down and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:15 When he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him, he said, "Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel; so please take a present from your servant now."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:16 But he said, "As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will take nothing." And he urged him to take [it,] but he refused.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:17 And Naaman said, "If not, please let your servant at least be given two mules' load of earth; for your servant will no more offer burnt offering nor will he sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:18 "In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant£º when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:19 And he said to him, "Go in peace." So he departed from him some distance.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, "Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not receiving from his hands what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him."
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, "Is all well?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:22 And he said, "All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:23 And Naaman said, "Be pleased to take two talents." And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes, and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried [them] before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:24 When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed.
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:25 But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, " Where have you been, Gehazi? "And he said," Your servant went nowhere. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:26 Then he said to him, "Did not my heart go [with you,] when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female servants?
12¿ÕÇÏ 5:27 "Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you and to your descendants forever." So he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:1 Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Behold now, the place before you where we are living is too limited for us.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:2 "Please let us go to the Jordan, and each of us take from there a beam, and let us make a place there for ourselves where we may live." So he said, "Go."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:3 Then one said, "Please be willing to go with your servants." And he answered, "I shall go."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:4 So he went with them; and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, "Alas, my master! For it was borrowed."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:6 Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" And when he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw [it] in there, and made the iron float.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:7 And he said, "Take it up for yourself." So he put out his hand and took it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:8 Now the king of Aram was warring against Israel; and he counseled with his servants saying, "In such and such a place shall be my camp."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:9 And the man of God sent [word] to the king of Israel saying, "Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Arameans are coming down there."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had told him; thus he warned him, so that he guarded himself there, more than once or twice.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:11 Now the heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:12 And one of his servants said, "No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:13 So he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and take him." And it was told him, saying," Behold, he is in Dothan. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:14 And he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:15 Now when the attendant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was circling the city. And his servant said to him, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:16 So he answered, "Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:17 Then Elisha prayed and said, "O LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see." And the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, "Strike this people with blindness, I pray." So He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:19 Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the way, nor is this the city; follow me and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he brought them to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:20 And it came about when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, "O LORD, open the eyes of these [men,] that they may see." So the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:21 Then the king of Israel when he saw them, said to Elisha, "My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:22 And he answered, "You shall not kill [them.] Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:23 So he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:24 Now it came about after this, that Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army and went up and besieged Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty [shekels] of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five [shekels] of silver.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:26 And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:27 And he said, "If the LORD does not help you, from where shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:28 And the king said to her, "What is the matter with you?" And she answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give your son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:29 "So we boiled my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him'; but she has hidden her son."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:30 And it came about when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes-- now he was passing by on the wall-- and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body.
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:31 Then he said, "May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today."
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And [the king] sent a man from his presence; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 6:33 And while he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him, and he said, "Behold, this evil is from the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:1 Then Elisha said, "Listen to the word of the LORD; thus says the LORD, 'Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:2 And the royal officer on whose hand the king was leaning answered the man of God and said, "Behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" Then he said, "Behold you shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:3 Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, "Why do we sit here until we die?
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:4 "If we say, 'We will enter the city,' then the famine is in the city and we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:5 And they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:6 For the Lord had caused the army of the Arameans to hear a sound of chariots and a sound of horses, [even] the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:7 Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents and their horses and their donkeys, even the camp just as it was, and fled for their life.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:8 When these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver and gold and clothes, and went and hid [them]; and they returned and entered another tent and carried from there [also,] and went and hid [them.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:9 Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, but we are keeping silent; if we wait until morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:10 So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and they told them, saying, "We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor the voice of man, only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:11 And the gatekeepers called, and told [it] within the king's household.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:12 Then the king arose in the night and said to his servants, "I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone from the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall capture them alive and get into the city.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, "Please, let some [men] take five of the horses which remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they [will be in any case] like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they [will be in any case] like all the multitude of Israel who have already perished, so let us send and see."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:14 They took therefore two chariots with horses, and the king sent after the army of the Arameans, saying, "Go and see."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:15 And they went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of clothes and equipment, which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:16 So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a measure of fine flour [was sold] for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:17 Now the king appointed the royal officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; but the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:18 And it came about just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be [sold] tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria."
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:19 Then the royal officer answered the man of God and said, "Now behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?" And he said," Behold, you shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 7:20 And so it happened to him, for the people trampled on him at the gate, and he died.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:1 Now Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Arise and go with your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn; for the LORD has called for a famine, and it shall even come on the land for seven years."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:2 So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:3 And it came about at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went out to appeal to the king for her house and for her field.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:4 Now the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Please relate to me all the great things that Elisha has done."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:5 And it came about, as he was relating to the king how he had restored to life the one who was dead, that behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life, appealed to the king for her house and for her field. And Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:6 When the king asked the woman, she related [it] to him. So the king appointed for her a certain officer, saying, "Restore all that was hers and all the produce of the field from the day that she left the land even until now."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:7 Then Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and it was told him, saying, "The man of God has come here."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:8 And the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift in your hand and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:9 So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every kind of good thing of Damascus, forty camels' loads; and he came and stood before him and said, "Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:10 Then Elisha said to him, "Go, say to him, 'You shall surely recover,' but the LORD has shown me that he will certainly die."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:11 And he fixed his gaze steadily [on him] until he was ashamed, and the man of God wept.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:12 And Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" Then he answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel£º their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword, and their little ones you will dash in pieces, and their women with child you will rip up."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:13 Then Hazael said, "But what is your servant, [who is but] a dog, that he should do this great thing?" And Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:14 So he departed from Elisha and returned to his master, who said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And he answered, "He told me that you would surely recover."
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:15 And it came about on the morrow, that he took the cover and dipped it in water and spread it on his face, so that he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:16 Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then the king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:19 However, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David His servant, since He had promised him to give a lamp to him through his sons always.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:21 Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And it came about that he arose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; but [his] army fled to their tents.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:22 So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:24 So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:26 Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, like the house of Ahab [had done,] because he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:28 Then he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.
12¿ÕÇÏ 8:29 So King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:1 Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, "Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:2 "When you arrive there, search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and bid him arise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:3 "Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, 'Thus says the LORD," I have anointed you king over Israel. "'Then open the door and flee and do not wait."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:4 So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:5 When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting, and he said, "I have a word for you, O captain." And Jehu said, "For which [one] of us?" And he said, "For you, O captain."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:6 And he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:7 'And you shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:8 'For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and free in Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:9 'And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:10 'And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury [her.]' "Then he opened the door and fled.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:11 Now Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one said to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" And he said to them, "You know [very well] the man and his talk."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:12 And they said, "It is a lie, tell us now." And he said, "Thus and thus he said to me, 'Thus says the LORD," I have anointed you king over Israel. "'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:13 Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, "Jehu is king!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram,
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:15 but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu said, "If this is your mind, [then] let no one escape [or] leave the city to go tell [it] in Jezreel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:16 Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." And Joram said, " Take a horseman and send him to meet them and let him say, 'Is it peace?' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:18 So a horseman went to meet him and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu said, "What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me." And the watchman reported," The messenger came to them, but he did not return. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:19 Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, "Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'" And Jehu answered, "What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:20 And the watchman reported, "He came even to them, and he did not return; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:21 Then Joram said, "Get ready." And they made his chariot ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:22 And it came about, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" And he answered, "What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:23 So Joram reined about and fled and said to Ahaziah, "[There is] treachery, O Ahaziah!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:24 And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:25 Then [Jehu] said to Bidkar his officer, "Take [him] up and cast him into the property of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab his father, that the LORD laid this oracle against him£º
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:26 'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,' says the LORD, 'and I will repay you in this property,' says the LORD. Now then, take and cast him into the property, according to the word of the LORD. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:27 When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this,] he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him and said, "Shoot him too, in the chariot." [So they shot him] at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam. But he fled to Megiddo and died there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:28 Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:29 Now in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard [of it,] and she painted her eyes and adorned her head, and looked out the window.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:31 And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it well, Zimri, your master's murderer?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:32 Then he lifted up his face to the window and said, "Who is on my side? Who?" And two or three officials looked down at him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:33 And he said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her under foot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:34 When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, "See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter."
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:35 And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:36 Therefore they returned and told him. And he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'In the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;
12¿ÕÇÏ 9:37 and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel, so they cannot say, "This is Jezebel." '"
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:1 Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent [them] to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and to the guardians of [the children of] Ahab, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:2 "And now, when this letter comes to you, since your master's sons are with you, as well as the chariots and horses and a fortified city and the weapons,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:3 select the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set [him] on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:4 But they feared greatly and said, "Behold, the two kings did not stand before him; how then can we stand?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:5 And the one who [was] over the household, and he who [was] over the city, the elders, and the guardians of [the children,] sent [word] to Jehu, saying, "We are your servants, all that you say to us we will do, we will not make any man king; do what is good in your sight."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:6 Then he wrote a letter to them a second time saying, "If you are on my side, and you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men, your master's sons, and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time." Now the king's sons, seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city, [ who] were rearing them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:7 And it came about when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slaughtered [them,] seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent [them] to him at Jezreel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:8 When the messenger came and told him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons," he said, "Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:9 Now it came about in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, "You are innocent; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:10 "Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:11 So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him without a survivor.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:12 Then he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. On the way while he was at Beth-eked of the shepherds,
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:13 Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, "Who are you?" And they answered, "We are the relatives of Ahaziah; and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:14 And he said, "Take them alive." So they took them alive, and killed them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:15 Now when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab [coming] to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?" And Jehonadab answered, " It is. "[Jehu said,]" If it is, give [me] your hand. "And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:16 And he said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." So he made him ride in his chariot.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke to Elijah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:18 Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:19 "And now, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests; let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live." But Jehu did it in cunning, in order that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:20 And Jehu said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." And they proclaimed [it.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:21 Then Jehu sent throughout Israel and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And when they went into the house of Baal, the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:22 And he said to the one who [was] in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out garments for all the worshipers of Baal." So he brought out garments for them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:23 And Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, "Search and see that there may be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but only the worshipers of Baal."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he had said, "The one who permits any of the men whom I bring into your hands to escape, shall give up his life in exchange."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:25 Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the royal officers, "Go in, kill them; let none come out." And they killed them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the royal officers threw [them] out, and went to the inner room of the house of Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:26 And they brought out the [sacred] pillars of the house of Baal, and burned them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:27 They also broke down the [sacred] pillar of Baal and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:28 Thus Jehu eradicated Baal out of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:29 However, [as for] the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin, from these Jehu did not depart, [even] the golden calves that [were] at Bethel and that [were] at Dan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:30 And the LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in executing what is right in My eyes, [and] have done to the house of Ahab according to all that [was] in My heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:32 In those days the LORD began to cut off [portions] from Israel; and Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel£º
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites and the Reubenites and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:35 And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 10:36 Now the time which Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria [was] twenty-eight years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:1 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:3 So he was hidden with her in the house of the LORD six years, while Athaliah was reigning over the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:4 Now in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him in the house of the LORD. Then he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:5 And he commanded them, saying, "This is the thing that you shall do£º one third of you, who come in on the sabbath and keep watch over the king's house
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:6 (one third also [shall be] at the gate Sur, and one third at the gate behind the guards), shall keep watch over the house for defense.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:7 "And two parts of you, [even] all who go out on the sabbath, shall also keep watch over the house of the LORD for the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:8 "Then you shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within the ranks shall be put to death. And be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in."
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:9 So the captains of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:10 And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David's, which [were] in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:11 And the guards stood each with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:12 Then he brought the king's son out and put the crown on him, and [ gave him] the testimony; and they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, "[Long] live the king!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:13 When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and of] the people, she came to the people in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:14 And she looked and behold, the king was standing by the pillar, according to the custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, "Treason! Treason!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:15 And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army, and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever follows her put to death with the sword." For the priest said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD."
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:16 So they seized her, and when she arrived at the horses' entrance of the king's house, she was put to death there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord's people, also between the king and the people.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:18 And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:19 And he took the captains of hundreds and the Carites and the guards and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guards to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:20 So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 11:21 Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:2 And Jehoash did right in the sight of the LORD all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:3 Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:4 Then Jehoash said to the priests, "All the money of the sacred things which is brought into the house of the LORD, in current money, [both] the money of each man's assessment [and] all the money which any man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD,
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:5 let the priests take it for themselves, each from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the damages of the house wherever any damage may be found.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:6 But it came about that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damages of the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:7 Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the [other] priests and said to them, "Why do you not repair the damages of the house? Now therefore take no [more] money from your acquaintances, but pay it for the damages of the house."
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:8 So the priests agreed that they should take no [more] money from the people, nor repair the damages of the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid, and put it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD; and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money which was brought into the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:10 And when they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up and tied [it] in bags and counted the money which was found in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:11 And they gave the money which was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of the LORD;
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:12 and to the masons and the stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the damages to the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:13 But there were not made for the house of the LORD silver cups, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver from the money which was brought into the house of the LORD;
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:14 for they gave that to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:15 Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hand they gave the money to pay to those who did the work, for they dealt faithfully.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:16 The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of the LORD; it was for the priests.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:17 Then Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it, and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things and all the gold that was found among the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent [ them] to Hazael king of Aram. Then he went away from Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:19 Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:20 And his servants arose and made a conspiracy, and struck down Joash at the house of Millo [as he was] going down to Silla.
12¿ÕÇÏ 12:21 For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck [him,] and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria, [and he reigned] seventeen years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin; he did not turn from them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:3 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He gave them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Aram, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:4 Then Jehoahaz entreated the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:5 And the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans; and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as formerly.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:6 Nevertheless they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:7 For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 100000 footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, became king over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] sixteen years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:11 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel sin, but he walked in them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:13 So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:14 When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:15 And Elisha said to him, "Take a bow and arrows." So he took a bow and arrows.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:16 Then he said to the king of Israel, "Put your hand on the bow." And he put his hand [on it,] then Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:17 And he said, "Open the window toward the east," and he opened [it.] Then Elisha said, "Shoot!" And he shot. And he said, "The Lord's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Aram; for you shall defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you have destroyed [them."]
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:18 Then he said, "Take the arrows," and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground," and he struck [it] three times and stopped.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:19 So the man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck five or six times, then you would have struck Aram until you would have destroyed [it.] But now you shall strike Aram [only] three times."
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:21 And as they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band; and they cast the man into the grave of Elisha. And when the man touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:22 Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:23 But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence until now.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:24 When Hazael king of Aram died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 13:25 Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of Jehoahaz his father. Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:3 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:4 Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:5 Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his hand, that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:6 But the sons of the slayers he did not put to death, according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the LORD commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, nor the sons be put to death for the fathers; but each shall be put to death for his own sin."
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:7 He killed [of] Edom in the Valley of Salt 100000 and took Sela by war, and named it Joktheel to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us face each other."
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:9 And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, " The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled the thorn bush.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:10 "You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Enjoy your glory and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, should fall, and Judah with you?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:11 But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:12 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:13 Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:14 And he took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:16 So Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:18 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:19 And they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:20 Then they brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who [was] sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:22 He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel became king in Samaria, [and reigned] forty-one years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:24 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:25 He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, [which was] very bitter; for there was neither bond nor free, nor was there any helper for Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:27 And the LORD did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he fought and how he recovered for Israel, Damascus and Hamath, [which had belonged] to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 14:29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:3 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:4 Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:5 And the LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, while Jotham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:7 And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria [for] six months.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:9 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:10 Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him before the people and killed him, and reigned in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:11 Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:12 This is the word of the LORD which He spoke to Jehu, saying, "Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel." And so it was.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:13 Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned one month in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:14 Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed him and became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:16 Then Menahem struck Tiphsah and all who were in it and its borders from Tirzah, because they did not open [to him,] therefore he struck [it;] and he ripped up all its women who were with child.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel [and reigned] ten years in Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:18 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:19 Pul, king of Assyria, came against the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his rule.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:20 Then Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver to pay the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned and did not remain there in the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:21 Now the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:22 And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] two years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:24 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:25 Then Pekah son of Remaliah, his officer, conspired against him and struck him in Samaria, in the castle of the king's house with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites, and he killed him and became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:26 Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] twenty years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:28 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon and Abel-beth-maacah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him and put him to death and became king in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:34 And he did what was right in the sight of the LORD; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:35 Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:37 In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:2 Ahaz [was] twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD his God, as his father David [had done.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out from before the sons of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:4 And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:5 Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to [wage] war; and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:6 At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, and cleared the Judeans out of Elath entirely; and the Arameans came to Elath, and have lived there to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, "I am your servant and your son; come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram, and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me."
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:9 So the king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it, and carried [the people of] it away into exile to Kir, and put Rezin to death.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:10 Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar which [was] at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model, according to all its workmanship.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:11 So Urijah the priest built an altar; according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, thus Urijah the priest made [it,] before the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:12 And when the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar; then the king approached the altar and went up to it,
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:13 and burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his libation and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:14 And the bronze altar, which [was] before the LORD, he brought from the front of the house, from between [his] altar and the house of the LORD, and he put it on the north side of [his] altar.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:15 Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, "Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering and the king's burnt offering and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meal offering and their libations; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire [ by.]"
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:16 So Urijah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:17 Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands, and removed the laver from them; he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen which were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:18 And the covered way for the sabbath which they had built in the house, and the outer entry of the king, he removed from the house of the LORD because of the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 16:20 So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] nine years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:3 Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:4 But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as [he had done] year by year; so the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:5 Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and settled them in Halah and Habor, [on] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:7 Now [this] came about, because the sons of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:8 and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel, and [in the customs] of the kings of Israel which they had introduced.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:9 And the sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right, against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:10 And they set for themselves [sacred] pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:11 and there they burned incense on all the high places as the nations [did] which the LORD had carried away to exile before them; and they did evil things provoking the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:12 And they served idols, concerning which the LORD had said to them, "You shall not do this thing."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:13 Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah, through all His prophets [ and] every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:14 However, they did not listen, but stiffened their neck like their fathers, who did not believe in the LORD their God.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:15 And they rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers, and His warnings with which He warned them. And they followed vanity and became vain, and [went] after the nations which surrounded them, concerning which the LORD had commanded them not to do like them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:16 And they forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves molten images, [even] two calves, and made an Asherah and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:17 Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, and practiced divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:18 So the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; none was left except the tribe of Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:19 Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the customs which Israel had introduced.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:20 And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them out of His sight.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:21 When He had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the LORD, and made them commit a great sin.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:22 And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them,
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:23 until the LORD removed Israel from His sight, as He spoke through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away into exile from their own land to Assyria until this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:24 And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Avva and from Hamath and Sephar-vaim, and settled [them] in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel. So they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:25 And it came about at the beginning of their living there, that they did not fear the LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them which killed some of them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:26 So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations whom you have carried away into exile in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the god of the land; so he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them because they do not know the custom of the god of the land."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Take there one of the priests whom you carried away into exile, and let him go and live there; and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away into exile from Samaria came and lived at Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:29 But every nation still made gods of its own and put them in the houses of the high places which the people of Samaria had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:31 and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:32 They also feared the LORD and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places, who acted for them in the houses of the high places.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:33 They feared the LORD and served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from among whom they had been carried away into exile.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:34 To this day they do according to the earlier customs£º they do not fear the LORD, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances or the law, or the commandments which the LORD commanded the sons of Jacob, whom He named Israel;
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:35 with whom the LORD made a covenant and commanded them, saying, " You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:36 "But the LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, and to Him you shall bow yourselves down, and to Him you shall sacrifice.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:37 "And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment, which He wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever; and you shall not fear other gods.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:38 "And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:39 "But the LORD your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:40 However, they did not listen, but they did according to their earlier custom.
12¿ÕÇÏ 17:41 So while these nations feared the LORD, they also served their idols; their children likewise and their grandchildren, as their fathers did, so they do to this day.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:1 Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:3 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:4 He removed the high places and broke down the [sacred] pillars and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:5 He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [among those] who were before him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:6 For he clung to the LORD; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the LORD had commanded Moses.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:7 And the LORD was with him; wherever he went he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:8 He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:9 Now it came about in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:10 And at the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:11 Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:12 because they did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded; they would neither listen, nor do [it.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:14 Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will bear." So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:15 And Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver which was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:16 At that time Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of the LORD, and [from] the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:17 Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fuller's field.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:18 When they called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:19 Then Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria," What is this confidence that you have?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:20 "You say (but [they are] only empty words), '[I have] counsel and strength for the war.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:21 "Now behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, [even] on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:22 "But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:23 "Now therefore, come, make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:24 "How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master's servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:25 "Have I now come up without the Lord's approval against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'" '"
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:26 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, "Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand [it;] and do not speak with us in Judean, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:27 But Rabshakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, [and] not to the men who sit on the wall, [doomed] to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:29 "Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand;
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:30 nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:31 'Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, "Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:32 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you may live and not die. "But do not listen to Hezekiah, when he misleads you, saying," The LORD will deliver us. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:33 'Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:34 'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:35 'Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:36 But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him."
12¿ÕÇÏ 18:37 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:1 And when King Hezekiah heard [it,] he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:2 Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:3 And they said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to [deliver.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:4 'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:6 And Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD," Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:7 "Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land." '"
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:8 Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:9 When he heard [them] say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "Behold, he has come out to fight against you," he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:10 "Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you saying," Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:11 'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:12 'Did the gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them, [even] Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who [were] in Telassar?
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:13 'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and [of] Hena and Ivvah?' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:14 Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, who art enthroned [above] the cherubim, Thou art the God, Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made heaven and earth.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:16 "Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:17 "Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:18 and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:19 "And now, O LORD our God, I pray, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou alone, O LORD, art God."
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard [you.]'
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:21 "This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him£º 'She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken [her] head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem!
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:22 'Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised [your] voice, And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:23 'Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, "With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars [and] its choice cypresses. And I entered its farthest lodging place, its thickest forest.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:24 "I dug [wells] and drank foreign waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt."
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:25 'Have you not heard? Long ago I did it; From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:26 'Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:27 'But I know your sitting down, And your going out and your coming in, And your raging against Me.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:28 'Because of your raging against Me, And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:29 'Then this shall be the sign for you£º you shall eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:30 'And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:31 'For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD shall perform this.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:32 'Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, "He shall not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; neither shall he come before it with a shield, nor throw up a mound against it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:33 "By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city," 'declares the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:34 'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:35 Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went out, and struck 1850000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned [home,] and lived at Nineveh.
12¿ÕÇÏ 19:37 And it came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:1 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:3 "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in Thy sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:4 And it came about before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:5 "Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David," I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:6 "And I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David's sake." '"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Take a cake of figs." And they took and laid [it] on the boil, and he recovered.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:8 Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:9 And Isaiah said, "This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that He has spoken£º shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:10 So Hezekiah answered, "It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD, and He brought the shadow on the stairway back ten steps by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:12 At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:13 And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come from a far country, from Babylon."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:15 And he said, "What have they seen in your house?" So Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:17 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,' says the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:18 'And some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall beget, shall be taken away; and they shall become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good." For he thought, "Is it not so, if there shall be peace and truth in my days?"
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:20 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might, and how he made the pool and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 20:21 So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:3 For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put My name."
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:5 For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:6 And he made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and used divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD provoking [Him to anger.]
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:7 Then he set the carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the LORD said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:8 "And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them."
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:9 But they did not listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do evil more than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:10 Now the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:11 "Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who [were] before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols;
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:12 therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing [such] calamity on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:13 'And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:14 'And I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become as plunder and spoil to all their enemies;
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:15 because they have done evil in My sight, and have been provoking Me to anger, since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day. ' "
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:16 Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin which he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:20 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:21 For he walked in all the way that his father had walked, and served the idols that his father had served and worshiped them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:22 So he forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:24 Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 21:26 And he was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:2 And he did right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the way of his father David, nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:3 Now it came about in the eighteenth year of King Josiah that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the LORD saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:4 "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:5 "And let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the LORD to repair the damages of the house,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:6 to the carpenters and the builders and the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:7 "Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money delivered into their hands, for they deal faithfully."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:8 Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan who read it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and said, "Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:10 Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:11 And it came about when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:12 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant saying,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:13 "Go, inquire of the LORD for me and the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us."
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:15 And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel, 'Tell the man who sent you to me,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:16 thus says the LORD, "Behold, I bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, [even] all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:17 "Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched." '
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:18 "But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD thus shall you say to him, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel," [Regarding] the words which you have heard,
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:19 because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I truly have heard you, "declares the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 22:20 "Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place." '"So they brought back word to the king.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:1 Then the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:2 And the king went up to the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:3 And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all [his] heart and all [his] soul, to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:5 And he did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surrounding area of Jerusalem, also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:6 And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the LORD outside Jerusalem to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and ground [it] to dust, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:7 He also broke down the houses of the [male] cult prostitutes which [ were] in the house of the LORD, where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:8 Then he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates which [were] at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which [were] on one's left at the city gate.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:10 He also defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire for Molech.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:11 And he did away with the horses which the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the official, which [was] in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:12 And the altars which [were] on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, the king broke down; and he smashed them there, and threw their dust into the brook Kidron.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:13 And the high places which [were] before Jerusalem, which [were] on the right of the mount of destruction which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:14 And he broke in pieces the [sacred] pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with human bones.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:15 Furthermore, the altar that [was] at Bethel [and] the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down. Then he demolished its stones, ground them to dust, and burned the Asherah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:16 Now when Josiah turned, he saw the graves that [were] there on the mountain, and he sent and took the bones from the graves and burned [them] on the altar and defiled it according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:17 Then he said, "What is this monument that I see?" And the men of the city told him, "It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel."
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:18 And he said, "Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones." So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:19 And Josiah also removed all the houses of the high places which [were] in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made provoking the LORD; and he did to them just as he had done in Bethel.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:20 And all the priests of the high places who [were] there he slaughtered on the altars and burned human bones on them; then he returned to Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:21 Then the king commanded all the people saying, "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God as it is written in this book of the covenant."
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:22 Surely such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:24 Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:25 And before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:26 However, the LORD did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:27 And the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also from My sight, as I have removed Israel. And I will cast off Jerusalem, this city which I have chosen, and the temple of which I said, 'My name shall be there.'"
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:29 In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates. And King Josiah went to meet him, and when [ Pharaoh Neco] saw him he killed him at Megiddo.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:30 And his servants drove his body in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:32 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:33 And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:34 And Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz away and brought [him] to Egypt, and he died there.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:35 So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed the land in order to give the money at the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his valuation, to give it to Pharaoh Neco.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 23:37 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant [for] three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, bands of Moabites, and bands of Ammonites. So He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which He had spoken through His servants the prophets.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:3 Surely at the command of the LORD it came upon Judah, to remove [ them] from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:4 and also for the innocent blood which he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the LORD would not forgive.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:7 And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:9 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his officials. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:13 And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, just as the LORD had said.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:14 Then he led away into exile all Jerusalem and all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:15 So he led Jehoiachin away into exile to Babylon; also the king's mother and the king's wives and his officials and the leading men of the land, he led away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:16 And all the men of valor, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths, one thousand, all strong and fit for war, and these the king of Babylon brought into exile to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:17 Then the king of Babylon made his uncle Mattaniah, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:19 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
12¿ÕÇÏ 24:20 For through the anger of the LORD [this] came about in Jerusalem and Judah until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:1 Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it, and built a siege wall all around it.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:2 So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:3 On the ninth day of the [fourth] month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:4 Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war [fled] by night by way of the gate between the two walls beside the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:6 Then they captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:7 And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:8 Now on the seventh day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:9 And he burned the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every great house he burned with fire.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:10 So all the army of the Chaldeans who [were with] the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:11 Then the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into exile.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:12 But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:13 Now the bronze pillars which were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:14 And they took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze vessels which were used in [temple] service.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:15 The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and the basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD-- the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a bronze capital was on it; the height of the capital was three cubits, with a network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these with network.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:18 Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:19 And from the city he took one official who was overseer of the men of war, and five of the king's advisers who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:20 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:21 Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile from its land.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:22 Now [as for] the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan over them.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:23 When all the captains of the forces, they and [their] men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah [governor,] they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:24 And Gedaliah swore to them and their men and said to them, "Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans; live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you."
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:25 But it came about in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah down so that he died along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:26 Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:27 Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh [day] of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison;
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:28 and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who [were] with him in Babylon.
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:29 And Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king's presence regularly all the days of his life;
12¿ÕÇÏ 25:30 and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life.

13´ë»ó 9:33 Now these are the singers, heads of fathers' [households] of the Levites, [who lived] in the chambers [of the temple] free [from other service;] for they were engaged in their work day and night.
13´ë»ó 9:34 These were heads of fathers' [households] of the Levites according to their generations, chief men, who lived in Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 9:35 And in Gibeon Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived, and his wife's name was Maacah,
13´ë»ó 9:36 and his first-born son [was] Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
13´ë»ó 9:37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
13´ë»ó 9:38 And Mikloth became the father of Shimeam. And they also lived with their relatives in Jerusalem opposite their [other] relatives.
13´ë»ó 9:39 And Ner became the father of Kish, and Kish became the father of Saul, and Saul became the father of Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
13´ë»ó 9:40 And the son of Jonathan [was] Merib-baal; and Merib-baal became the father of Micah.
13´ë»ó 9:41 And the sons of Micah [were] Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, [and Ahaz.]
13´ë»ó 9:42 And Ahaz became the father of Jarah, and Jarah became the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri became the father of Moza,
13´ë»ó 9:43 and Moza became the father of Binea and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
13´ë»ó 9:44 And Azel had six sons whose names are these£º Azrikam, Bocheru and Ishmael and Sheariah and Obadiah and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.
13´ë»ó 10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
13´ë»ó 10:2 And the Philistines closely pursued Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
13´ë»ó 10:3 And the battle became heavy against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was wounded by the archers.
13´ë»ó 10:4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me." But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it.
13´ë»ó 10:5 And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.
13´ë»ó 10:6 Thus Saul died with his three sons, and all [those] of his house died together.
13´ë»ó 10:7 When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
13´ë»ó 10:8 And it came about the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
13´ë»ó 10:9 So they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent [messengers] around the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
13´ë»ó 10:10 And they put his armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
13´ë»ó 10:11 When all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
13´ë»ó 10:12 all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
13´ë»ó 10:13 So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against the LORD, because of the word of the LORD which he did not keep; and also because he asked counsel of a medium, making inquiry [of it],
13´ë»ó 10:14 and did not inquire of the LORD. Therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
13´ë»ó 11:1 Then all Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
13´ë»ó 11:2 "In times past, even when Saul was king, you [were] the one who led out and brought in Israel; and the LORD your God said to you, 'You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be prince over My people Israel.'"
13´ë»ó 11:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD through Samuel.
13´ë»ó 11:4 Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, [were] there.
13´ë»ó 11:5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not enter here." Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion (that is, the city of David).
13´ë»ó 11:6 Now David had said, "Whoever strikes down a Jebusite first shall be chief and commander." And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
13´ë»ó 11:7 Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
13´ë»ó 11:8 And he built the city all around, from the Millo even to the surrounding area; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
13´ë»ó 11:9 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.
13´ë»ó 11:10 Now these are the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
13´ë»ó 11:11 And these [constitute] the list of the mighty men whom David had£º Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he killed at one time.
13´ë»ó 11:12 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was] one of the three mighty men.
13´ë»ó 11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim when the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines.
13´ë»ó 11:14 And they took their stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and struck down the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.
13´ë»ó 11:15 Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam, while the army of the Philistines was camping in the valley of Rephaim.
13´ë»ó 11:16 And David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of the Philistines [was] then in Bethlehem.
13´ë»ó 11:17 And David had a craving and said, "Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
13´ë»ó 11:18 So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which [was] by the gate, and took [it] and brought [it] to David; nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD;
13´ë»ó 11:19 and he said, "Be it far from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men [who went] at the risk of their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
13´ë»ó 11:20 As for Abshai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thirty, and he swung his spear against three hundred and killed them; and he had a name as well as the thirty.
13´ë»ó 11:21 Of the three in the second [rank] he was the most honored, and became their commander; however, he did not attain to the [first] three.
13´ë»ó 11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, mighty in deeds, struck down the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion inside a pit on a snowy day.
13´ë»ó 11:23 And he killed an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature five cubits tall. Now in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam, but he went down to him with a club and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
13´ë»ó 11:24 These [things] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and had a name as well as the three mighty men.
13´ë»ó 11:25 Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three; and David appointed him over his guard.
13´ë»ó 11:26 Now the mighty men of the armies [were] Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
13´ë»ó 11:27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
13´ë»ó 11:28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
13´ë»ó 11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
13´ë»ó 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
13´ë»ó 11:31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
13´ë»ó 11:32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
13´ë»ó 11:33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
13´ë»ó 11:34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,
13´ë»ó 11:35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
13´ë»ó 11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
13´ë»ó 11:37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
13´ë»ó 11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,
13´ë»ó 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
13´ë»ó 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
13´ë»ó 11:41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
13´ë»ó 11:42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
13´ë»ó 11:43 Hanan the son of Maacah and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
13´ë»ó 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
13´ë»ó 11:45 Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
13´ë»ó 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
13´ë»ó 11:47 Eliel and Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
13´ë»ó 12:1 Now these are the ones who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still restricted because of Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men who helped [him] in war.
13´ë»ó 12:2 They were equipped with bows, using both the right hand and the left [to sling] stones and [to shoot] arrows from the bow; [they were] Saul's kinsmen from Benjamin.
13´ë»ó 12:3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah and Jehu the Anathothite,
13´ë»ó 12:4 and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty. Then Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,
13´ë»ó 12:5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite,
13´ë»ó 12:6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites,
13´ë»ó 12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
13´ë»ó 12:8 And from the Gadites there came over to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear, and whose faces were like the faces of lions, and [ they were] as swift as the gazelles on the mountains.
13´ë»ó 12:9 Ezer [was] the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
13´ë»ó 12:10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
13´ë»ó 12:11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
13´ë»ó 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
13´ë»ó 12:13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
13´ë»ó 12:14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army; he who was least was equal to a hundred and the greatest to a thousand.
13´ë»ó 12:15 These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
13´ë»ó 12:16 Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
13´ë»ó 12:17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, "If you come peacefully to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look on [it] and decide."
13´ë»ó 12:18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was the chief of the thirty, [ and he said,] "[We] are yours, O David, And with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, And peace to him who helps you; Indeed, your God helps you!" Then David received them and made them captains of the band.
13´ë»ó 12:19 From Manasseh also some defected to David, when he was about to go to battle with the Philistines against Saul. But they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines after consultation sent him away, saying, " At [the cost of] our heads he may defect to his master Saul. "
13´ë»ó 12:20 As he went to Ziklag, there defected to him from Manasseh£º Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who belonged to Manasseh.
13´ë»ó 12:21 And they helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.
13´ë»ó 12:22 For day by day [men] came to David to help him, until there was a great army like the army of God.
13´ë»ó 12:23 Now these are the numbers of the divisions equipped for war, who came to David at Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 12:24 The sons of Judah who bore shield and spear [were] 68000, equipped for war.
13´ë»ó 12:25 Of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, 71000.
13´ë»ó 12:26 Of the sons of Levi 46000.
13´ë»ó 12:27 Now Jehoiada was the leader of [the house of] Aaron, and with him were 37000,
13´ë»ó 12:28 also Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father's house twenty-two captains.
13´ë»ó 12:29 And of the sons of Benjamin, Saul's kinsmen, 30000; for until now the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul.
13´ë»ó 12:30 And of the sons of Ephraim 208000, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers' households.
13´ë»ó 12:31 And of the half-tribe of Manasseh 180000, who were designated by name to come and make David king.
13´ë»ó 12:32 And of the sons of Issachar, men who understood the times, with knowledge of what Israel should do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their kinsmen were at their command.
13´ë»ó 12:33 Of Zebulun, there were 500000 who went out in the army, who could draw up in battle formation with all kinds of weapons of war and helped [David] with an undivided heart.
13´ë»ó 12:34 And of Naphtali [there were] 10000 captains, and with them 370000 with shield and spear.
13´ë»ó 12:35 And of the Danites who could draw up in battle formation, [there were] 286000.
13´ë»ó 12:36 And of Asher [there were] 400000 who went out in the army to draw up in battle formation.
13´ë»ó 12:37 And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites and the Gadites and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, [there were] 1200000 with all [kinds] of weapons of war for the battle.
13´ë»ó 12:38 All these, being men of war, who could draw up in battle formation, came to Hebron with a perfect heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one mind to make David king.
13´ë»ó 12:39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their kinsmen had prepared for them.
13´ë»ó 12:40 Moreover those who were near to them, [even] as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and on oxen, great quantities of flour cakes, fig cakes and bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen and sheep. There was joy indeed in Israel.
13´ë»ó 13:1 Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader.
13´ë»ó 13:2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you, and if it is from the LORD our God, let us send everywhere to our kinsmen who remain in all the land of Israel, also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities with pasture lands, that they may meet with us;
13´ë»ó 13:3 and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul. "
13´ë»ó 13:4 Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
13´ë»ó 13:5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
13´ë»ó 13:6 And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, [that is,] to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the LORD who is enthroned [above] the cherubim, where His name is called.
13´ë»ó 13:7 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
13´ë»ó 13:8 And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all [their] might, even with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and with trumpets.
13´ë»ó 13:9 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen nearly upset [it.]
13´ë»ó 13:10 And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzza, so He struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark; and he died there before God.
13´ë»ó 13:11 Then David became angry because of the Lord's outburst against Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza to this day.
13´ë»ó 13:12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, "How can I bring the ark of God [home] to me?"
13´ë»ó 13:13 So David did not take the ark with him to the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
13´ë»ó 13:14 Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the LORD blessed the family of Obed-edom with all that he had.
13´ë»ó 14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build a house for him.
13´ë»ó 14:2 And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, [and] that his kingdom was highly exalted, for the sake of His people Israel.
13´ë»ó 14:3 Then David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters.
13´ë»ó 14:4 And these are the names of the children born [to him] in Jerusalem£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
13´ë»ó 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
13´ë»ó 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
13´ë»ó 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
13´ë»ó 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them.
13´ë»ó 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
13´ë»ó 14:10 And David inquired of God, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt Thou give them into my hand?" Then the LORD said to him, "Go up, for I will give them into your hand."
13´ë»ó 14:11 So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there; and David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters." Therefore they named that place Baal-perazim.
13´ë»ó 14:12 And they abandoned their gods there; so David gave the order and they were burned with fire.
13´ë»ó 14:13 And the Philistines made yet another raid in the valley.
13´ë»ó 14:14 And David inquired again of God, and God said to him, "You shall not go up after them; circle around behind them, and come at them in front of the balsam trees.
13´ë»ó 14:15 "And it shall be when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
13´ë»ó 14:16 And David did just as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even as far as Gezer.
13´ë»ó 14:17 Then the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him on all the nations.
13´ë»ó 15:1 Now [David] built houses for himself in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.
13´ë»ó 15:2 Then David said, "No one is to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for the LORD chose them to carry the ark of God, and to minister to Him forever."
13´ë»ó 15:3 And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.
13´ë»ó 15:4 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites£º
13´ë»ó 15:5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his relatives;
13´ë»ó 15:6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and 220 of his relatives;
13´ë»ó 15:7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and 130 of his relatives;
13´ë»ó 15:8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and 200 of his relatives;
13´ë»ó 15:9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and 80 of his relatives;
13´ë»ó 15:10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and 112 of his relatives.
13´ë»ó 15:11 Then David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
13´ë»ó 15:12 and said to them, "You are the heads of the fathers' [households] of the Levites; consecrate yourselves both you and your relatives, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel, to [the place] that I have prepared for it.
13´ë»ó 15:13 "Because you did not [carry it] at the first, the LORD our God made an outburst on us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance."
13´ë»ó 15:14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
13´ë»ó 15:15 And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders, with the poles thereon as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 15:16 Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives the singers, with instruments of music, harps, lyres, loud-sounding cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
13´ë»ó 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,
13´ë»ó 15:18 and with them their relatives of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
13´ë»ó 15:19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan [were appointed] to sound aloud cymbals of bronze;
13´ë»ó 15:20 and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps [tuned] to alamoth;
13´ë»ó 15:21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to lead with lyres tuned to the sheminith.
13´ë»ó 15:22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was [in charge of] the singing; he gave instruction in singing because he was skillful.
13´ë»ó 15:23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
13´ë»ó 15:24 And Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also [were] gatekeepers for the ark.
13´ë»ó 15:25 So [it was] David, with the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy.
13´ë»ó 15:26 And it came about because God was helping the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
13´ë»ó 15:27 Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the singing [with] the singers. David also wore an ephod of linen.
13´ë»ó 15:28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the horn, with trumpets, with loud-sounding cymbals, with harps and lyres.
13´ë»ó 15:29 And it happened when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and making merry; and she despised him in her heart.
13´ë»ó 16:1 And they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
13´ë»ó 16:2 When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 16:3 And he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread and a portion [of meat] and a raisin cake.
13´ë»ó 16:4 And he appointed some of the Levites [as] ministers before the ark of the LORD, even to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel£º
13´ë»ó 16:5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, [then] Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with musical instruments, harps, lyres; also Asaph [played] loud-sounding cymbals,
13´ë»ó 16:6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests [blew] trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
13´ë»ó 16:7 Then on that day David first assigned Asaph and his relatives to give thanks to the LORD.
13´ë»ó 16:8 Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples.
13´ë»ó 16:9 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders.
13´ë»ó 16:10 Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad.
13´ë»ó 16:11 Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
13´ë»ó 16:12 Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done, His marvels and the judgments from His mouth,
13´ë»ó 16:13 O seed of Israel His servant, Sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
13´ë»ó 16:14 He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
13´ë»ó 16:15 Remember His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
13´ë»ó 16:16 [The covenant] which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac.
13´ë»ó 16:17 He also confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
13´ë»ó 16:18 Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, As the portion of your inheritance."
13´ë»ó 16:19 When they were only a few in number, Very few, and strangers in it,
13´ë»ó 16:20 And they wandered about from nation to nation, And from [one] kingdom to another people,
13´ë»ó 16:21 He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes, [saying,]
13´ë»ó 16:22 "Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm."
13´ë»ó 16:23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day.
13´ë»ó 16:24 Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.
13´ë»ó 16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods.
13´ë»ó 16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens.
13´ë»ó 16:27 Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and joy are in His place.
13´ë»ó 16:28 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
13´ë»ó 16:29 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Worship the LORD in holy array.
13´ë»ó 16:30 Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.
13´ë»ó 16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns."
13´ë»ó 16:32 Let the sea roar, and all it contains; Let the field exult, and all that is in it.
13´ë»ó 16:33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD; For He is coming to judge the earth.
13´ë»ó 16:34 O give thanks to the LORD, for [He is] good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
13´ë»ó 16:35 Then say, "Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, And glory in Thy praise."
13´ë»ó 16:36 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. Then all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD.
13´ë»ó 16:37 So he left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;
13´ë»ó 16:38 and Obed-edom with his 68 relatives; Obed-edom, also the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as gatekeepers.
13´ë»ó 16:39 And [he left] Zadok the priest and his relatives the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place which [was] at Gibeon,
13´ë»ó 16:40 to offer burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which He commanded Israel.
13´ë»ó 16:41 And with them [were] Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His lovingkindness is everlasting.
13´ë»ó 16:42 And with them [were] Heman and Jeduthun [with] trumpets and cymbals for those who should sound aloud, and [with] instruments [for] the songs of God, and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate.
13´ë»ó 16:43 Then all the people departed each to his house, and David returned to bless his household.
13´ë»ó 17:1 And it came about, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under curtains."
13´ë»ó 17:2 Then Nathan said to David, "Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you."
13´ë»ó 17:3 And it came about the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
13´ë»ó 17:4 "Go and tell David My servant, 'Thus says the LORD," You shall not build a house for Me to dwell in;
13´ë»ó 17:5 for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from [one] dwelling place [to another.]
13´ë»ó 17:6 "In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, 'Why have you not built for Me a house of cedar?'" '
13´ë»ó 17:7 "Now, therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts," I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be leader over My people Israel.
13´ë»ó 17:8 "And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
13´ë»ó 17:9 "And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more; neither shall the wicked waste them anymore as formerly,
13´ë»ó 17:10 even from the day that I commanded judges [to be] over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I tell you that the LORD will build a house for you.
13´ë»ó 17:11 "And it shall come about when your days are fulfilled that you must go [to be] with your fathers, that I will set up [one of] your descendants after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
13´ë»ó 17:12 "He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
13´ë»ó 17:13 "I will be his father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
13´ë»ó 17:14 "But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever." '"
13´ë»ó 17:15 According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
13´ë»ó 17:16 Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD and said, " Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house that Thou hast brought me this far?
13´ë»ó 17:17 "And this was a small thing in Thine eyes, O God; but Thou hast spoken of Thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the standard of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
13´ë»ó 17:18 "What more can David still [say] to Thee concerning the honor [bestowed] on Thy servant? For Thou knowest Thy servant.
13´ë»ó 17:19 "O LORD, for Thy servant's sake, and according to Thine own heart, Thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
13´ë»ó 17:20 "O LORD, there is none like Thee, neither is there any God besides Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
13´ë»ó 17:21 "And what one nation in the earth is like Thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself [as] a people, to make Thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem out of Egypt?
13´ë»ó 17:22 "For Thy people Israel Thou didst make Thine own people forever, and Thou, O LORD, didst become their God.
13´ë»ó 17:23 "And now, O LORD, let the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as Thou hast spoken.
13´ë»ó 17:24 "And let Thy name be established and magnified forever, saying, 'The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, [even] a God to Israel; and the house of David Thy servant is established before Thee.'
13´ë»ó 17:25 "For Thou, O my God, hast revealed to Thy servant that Thou wilt build for him a house; therefore Thy servant hath found [courage] to pray before Thee.
13´ë»ó 17:26 "And now, O LORD, Thou art God, and hast promised this good thing to Thy servant.
13´ë»ó 17:27 "And now it hath pleased Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue forever before Thee; for Thou, O LORD, hast blessed, and it is blessed forever."
13´ë»ó 18:1 Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines.
13´ë»ó 18:2 And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.
13´ë»ó 18:3 David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah [as far as] Hamath, as he went to establish his rule to the Euphrates River.
13´ë»ó 18:4 And David took from him 10000 chariots and 70000 horsemen and 200000 foot soldiers, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved [enough] of them for 100 chariots.
13´ë»ó 18:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed 220000 men of the Arameans.
13´ë»ó 18:6 Then David put [garrisons] among the Arameans of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went.
13´ë»ó 18:7 And David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 18:8 Also from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a very large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the bronze utensils.
13´ë»ó 18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
13´ë»ó 18:10 he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And [Hadoram brought] all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze.
13´ë»ó 18:11 King David also dedicated these to the LORD with the silver and the gold which he had carried away from all the nations£º from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and from Amalek.
13´ë»ó 18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah defeated 180000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13´ë»ó 18:13 Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went.
13´ë»ó 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel; and he administered justice and righteousness for all his people.
13´ë»ó 18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah [was] over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] recorder;
13´ë»ó 18:16 and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar [were] priests, and Shavsha [was] secretary;
13´ë»ó 18:17 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David [were] chiefs at the king's side.
13´ë»ó 19:1 Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place.
13´ë»ó 19:2 Then David said, "I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, to console him.
13´ë»ó 19:3 But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, "Do you think that David is honoring your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?"
13´ë»ó 19:4 So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away.
13´ë»ó 19:5 Then [certain persons] went and told David about the men. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, " Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and [then] return. "
13´ë»ó 19:6 When the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent 10000 talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah.
13´ë»ó 19:7 So they hired for themselves 320000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to battle.
13´ë»ó 19:8 When David heard [of it,] he sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men.
13´ë»ó 19:9 And the sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
13´ë»ó 19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and in the rear, he selected from all the choice men of Israel and they arrayed themselves against the Arameans.
13´ë»ó 19:11 But the remainder of the people he placed in the hand of Abshai his brother; and they arrayed themselves against the sons of Ammon.
13´ë»ó 19:12 And he said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
13´ë»ó 19:13 "Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is good in His sight."
13´ë»ó 19:14 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him.
13´ë»ó 19:15 When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans fled, they also fled before Abshai his brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 19:16 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
13´ë»ó 19:17 When it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when David drew up in battle array against the Arameans, they fought against him.
13´ë»ó 19:18 And the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed of the Arameans 70000 charioteers and 400000 foot soldiers, and put to death Shophach the commander of the army.
13´ë»ó 19:19 So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. Thus the Arameans were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
13´ë»ó 20:1 Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out [to battle,] that Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the sons of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
13´ë»ó 20:2 And David took the crown of their king from his head, and he found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there was a precious stone in it; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
13´ë»ó 20:3 And he brought out the people who [were] in it, and cut [them] with saws and with sharp instruments and with axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned [ to] Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 20:4 Now it came about after this, that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued.
13´ë»ó 20:5 And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear [was] like a weaver's beam.
13´ë»ó 20:6 And again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of [great] stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six [fingers on each hand] and six [toes on each foot;] and he also was descended from the giants.
13´ë»ó 20:7 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
13´ë»ó 20:8 These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
13´ë»ó 21:1 Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.
13´ë»ó 21:2 So David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, "Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me [word] that I may know their number."
13´ë»ó 21:3 And Joab said, "May the LORD add to His people a hundred times as many as they are! But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? Why does my lord seek this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?"
13´ë»ó 21:4 Nevertheless, the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
13´ë»ó 21:5 And Joab gave the number of the census of [all] the people to David. And all Israel were 110000000 men who drew the sword; and Judah [was] 4700000 men who drew the sword.
13´ë»ó 21:6 But he did not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
13´ë»ó 21:7 And God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel.
13´ë»ó 21:8 And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have done very foolishly."
13´ë»ó 21:9 And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
13´ë»ó 21:10 "Go and speak to David, saying, 'Thus says the LORD," I offer you three things; choose for yourself one of them, that I may do [it] to you. "'"
13´ë»ó 21:11 So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Take for yourself
13´ë»ó 21:12 either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes [you,] or else three days of the sword of the LORD, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. 'Now, therefore, consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me. "
13´ë»ó 21:13 And David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; please let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me fall into the hand of man."
13´ë»ó 21:14 So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel; 700000 men of Israel fell.
13´ë»ó 21:15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to destroy [it,] the LORD saw and was sorry over the calamity, and said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now relax your hand." And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13´ë»ó 21:16 Then David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.
13´ë»ó 21:17 And David said to God, "Is it not I who commanded to count the people? Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and done very wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Thy hand be against me and my father's household, but not against Thy people that they should be plagued."
13´ë»ó 21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
13´ë»ó 21:19 So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 21:20 Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons [who were] with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.
13´ë»ó 21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out from the threshing floor, and prostrated himself before David with his face to the ground.
13´ë»ó 21:22 Then David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of [this] threshing floor, that I may build on it an altar to the LORD; for the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be restrained from the people."
13´ë»ó 21:23 And Ornan said to David, "Take [it] for yourself; and let my lord the king do what is good in his sight. See, I will give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I will give [it] all."
13´ë»ó 21:24 But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will surely buy [it] for the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the LORD, or offer a burnt offering which costs me nothing."
13´ë»ó 21:25 So David gave Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.
13´ë»ó 21:26 Then David built an altar to the LORD there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to the LORD and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
13´ë»ó 21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back in its sheath.
13´ë»ó 21:28 At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifice there.
13´ë»ó 21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering [were] in the high place at Gibeon at that time.
13´ë»ó 21:30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 22:1 Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel."
13´ë»ó 22:2 So David gave orders to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to hew out stones to build the house of God.
13´ë»ó 22:3 And David prepared large quantities of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gates and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed;
13´ë»ó 22:4 and timbers of cedar logs beyond number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought large quantities of cedar timber to David.
13´ë»ó 22:5 And David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD shall be exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all lands. [Therefore] now I will make preparation for it." So David made ample preparations before his death.
13´ë»ó 22:6 Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
13´ë»ó 22:7 And David said to Solomon, "My son, I had intended to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.
13´ë»ó 22:8 "But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed much blood, and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to My name, because you have shed [so] much blood on the earth before Me.
13´ë»ó 22:9 'Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
13´ë»ó 22:10 'He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
13´ë»ó 22:11 "Now, my son, the LORD be with you that you may be successful, and build the house of the LORD your God just as He has spoken concerning you.
13´ë»ó 22:12 "Only the LORD give you discretion and understanding, and give you charge over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
13´ë»ó 22:13 "Then you shall prosper, if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous, do not fear nor be dismayed.
13´ë»ó 22:14 "Now behold, with great pains I have prepared for the house of the LORD 1000000 talents of gold and 100000000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for they are in great quantity; also timber and stone I have prepared, and you may add to them.
13´ë»ó 22:15 "Moreover, there are many workmen with you, stonecutters and masons of stone and carpenters, and all men who are skillful in every kind of work.
13´ë»ó 22:16 "Of the gold, the silver and the bronze and the iron, there is no limit. Arise and work, and may the LORD be with you."
13´ë»ó 22:17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon, [saying,]
13´ë»ó 22:18 "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before His people.
13´ë»ó 22:19 "Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the LORD."
13´ë»ó 23:1 Now when David reached old age, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
13´ë»ó 23:2 And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel with the priests and the Levites.
13´ë»ó 23:3 And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward, and their number by census of men was 380000.
13´ë»ó 23:4 Of these, 240000 were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and 60000 [were] officers and judges,
13´ë»ó 23:5 and 40000 [were] gatekeepers, and 40000 [were] praising the LORD with the instruments which David made for giving praise.
13´ë»ó 23:6 And David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
13´ë»ó 23:7 Of the Gershonites [were] Ladan and Shimei.
13´ë»ó 23:8 The sons of Ladan [were] Jehiel the first and Zetham and Joel, three.
13´ë»ó 23:9 The sons of Shimei [were] Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' [households] of Ladan.
13´ë»ó 23:10 And the sons of Shimei [were] Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four [were] the sons of Shimei.
13´ë»ó 23:11 And Jahath was the first, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became a father's household, one class.
13´ë»ó 23:12 The sons of Kohath were four£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
13´ë»ó 23:13 The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as most holy, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to Him and to bless in His name forever.
13´ë»ó 23:14 But [as for] Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
13´ë»ó 23:15 The sons of Moses [were] Gershom and Eliezer.
13´ë»ó 23:16 The son of Gershom [was] Shebuel the chief.
13´ë»ó 23:17 And the son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
13´ë»ó 23:18 The son of Izhar was Shelomith the chief.
13´ë»ó 23:19 The sons of Hebron [were] Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
13´ë»ó 23:20 The sons of Uzziel [were] Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
13´ë»ó 23:21 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli [were] Eleazar and Kish.
13´ë»ó 23:22 And Eleazar died and had no sons, but daughters only, so their brothers, the sons of Kish, took them [as wives.]
13´ë»ó 23:23 The sons of Mushi [were] three£º Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
13´ë»ó 23:24 These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers' households, [even] the heads of the fathers' [households] of those of them who were counted, in the number of names by their census, doing the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from twenty years old and upward.
13´ë»ó 23:25 For David said, "The LORD God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He dwells in Jerusalem forever.
13´ë»ó 23:26 "And also, the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its utensils for its service."
13´ë»ó 23:27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi [were] numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
13´ë»ó 23:28 For their office is to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God,
13´ë»ó 23:29 and with the showbread, and the fine flour for a grain offering, and unleavened wafers, or [what is baked in] the pan, or what is well-mixed, and all measures of volume and size.
13´ë»ó 23:30 And they are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the LORD, and likewise at evening,
13´ë»ó 23:31 and to offer all burnt offerings to the LORD, on the sabbaths, the new moons and the fixed festivals in the number [set] by the ordinance concerning them, continually before the LORD.
13´ë»ó 23:32 Thus they are to keep charge of the tent of meeting, and charge of the holy place, and charge of the sons of Aaron their relatives, for the service of the house of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 24:1 Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron [were these:] the sons of Aaron [were] Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
13´ë»ó 24:3 And David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their offices for their ministry.
13´ë»ó 24:4 Since more chief men were found from the descendants of Eleazar than the descendants of Ithamar, they divided them thus£º [there were] sixteen heads of fathers' households of the descendants of Eleazar, and eight of the descendants of Ithamar according to their fathers' households.
13´ë»ó 24:5 Thus they were divided by lot, the one as the other; for they were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the descendants of Eleazar and the descendants of Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:6 And Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers' [households] of the priests and of the Levites; one father's household taken for Eleazar and one taken for Ithamar.
13´ë»ó 24:7 Now the first lot came out for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah,
13´ë»ó 24:8 the third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim,
13´ë»ó 24:9 the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin,
13´ë»ó 24:10 the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah,
13´ë»ó 24:11 the ninth for Jeshua, the tenth for Shecaniah,
13´ë»ó 24:12 the eleventh for Eliashib, the twelfth for Jakim,
13´ë»ó 24:13 the thirteenth for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab,
13´ë»ó 24:14 the fifteenth for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer,
13´ë»ó 24:15 the seventeenth for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizzez,
13´ë»ó 24:16 the nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel,
13´ë»ó 24:17 the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul,
13´ë»ó 24:18 the twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.
13´ë»ó 24:19 These were their offices for their ministry, when [they] came in to the house of the LORD according to the ordinance [given] to them through Aaron their father, just as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
13´ë»ó 24:20 Now for the rest of the sons of Levi£º of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
13´ë»ó 24:21 Of Rehabiah£º of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the first.
13´ë»ó 24:22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
13´ë»ó 24:23 And the sons [of Hebron:] Jeriah [the first,] Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
13´ë»ó 24:24 [Of] the sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
13´ë»ó 24:25 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
13´ë»ó 24:26 The sons of Merari, Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, Beno.
13´ë»ó 24:27 The sons of Merari£º by Jaaziah [were] Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
13´ë»ó 24:28 By Mahli£º Eleazar, who had no sons.
13´ë»ó 24:29 By Kish£º the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel.
13´ë»ó 24:30 And the sons of Mushi£º Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These [were] the sons of the Levites according to their fathers' households.
13´ë»ó 24:31 These also cast lots just as their relatives the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' [households] of the priests and of the Levites-- the head of fathers' [households] as well as those of his younger brother.
13´ë»ó 25:1 Moreover, David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service [some] of the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun, who [were] to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals; and the number of those who performed their service was£º
13´ë»ó 25:2 Of the sons of Asaph£º Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons of Asaph [were] under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king.
13´ë»ó 25:3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun£º Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising the LORD.

13´ë»ó 25:5 All these [were] the sons of Heman the king's seer to exalt him according to the words of God, for God gave fourteen sons and three daughters to Heman.
13´ë»ó 25:6 All these were under the direction of their father to sing in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, harps and lyres, for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman [were] under the direction of the king.
13´ë»ó 25:7 And their number who were trained in singing to the LORD, with their relatives, all who were skillful, [was] 288.
13´ë»ó 25:8 And they cast lots for their duties, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher [as well] as the pupil.

13´ë»ó 26:6 Also to his son Shemaiah sons were born who ruled over the house of their father, for they were mighty men of valor.
13´ë»ó 26:7 The sons of Shemaiah [were] Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers, Elihu and Semachiah, were valiant men.
13´ë»ó 26:8 All these [were] of the sons of Obed-edom; they and their sons and their relatives [were] able men with strength for the service, 62 from Obed-edom.

13´ë»ó 26:12 To these divisions of the gatekeepers, the chief men, [were given] duties like their relatives to minister in the house of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 26:13 And they cast lots, the small and the great alike, according to their fathers' households, for every gate.
13´ë»ó 26:14 And the lot to the east fell to Shelemiah. Then they cast lots [for] his son Zechariah, a counselor with insight, and his lot came out to the north.
13´ë»ó 26:15 For Obed-edom [it fell] to the south, and to his sons went the storehouse.
13´ë»ó 26:16 For Shuppim and Hosah [it was] to the west, by the gate of Shallecheth, on the ascending highway. Guard corresponded to guard.

13´ë»ó 26:27 They dedicated part of the spoil won in battles to repair the house of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 26:28 And all that Samuel the seer had dedicated and Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner and Joab the son of Zeruiah, everyone who had dedicated [anything, all of this] was in the care of Shelomoth and his relatives.

13´ë»ó 27:23 But David did not count those twenty years of age and under, because the LORD had said He would multiply Israel as the stars of heaven.
13´ë»ó 27:24 Joab the son of Zeruiah had begun to count [them,] but did not finish; and because of this, wrath came upon Israel, and the number was not included in the account of the chronicles of King David.
13´ë»ó 27:25 Now Azmaveth the son of Adiel had charge of the king's storehouses. And Jonathan the son of Uzziah had charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers.

13´ë»ó 27:33 And Ahithophel was counselor to the king; and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.
13´ë»ó 27:34 And Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar succeeded Ahithophel; and Joab was the commander of the king's army.
13´ë»ó 28:1 Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the commanders of the divisions that served the king, and the commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds, and the overseers of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons, with the officials and the mighty men, even all the valiant men.
13´ë»ó 28:2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brethren and my people; I [had] intended to build a permanent home for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the footstool of our God. So I had made preparations to build [it.]
13´ë»ó 28:3 "But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.'
13´ë»ó 28:4 "Yet, the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be a leader; and in the house of Judah, my father's house, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make [me] king over all Israel.
13´ë»ó 28:5 "And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons), He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
13´ë»ó 28:6 "And He said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a father to him.
13´ë»ó 28:7 'And I will establish his kingdom forever, if he resolutely performs My commandments and My ordinances, as is done now.'
13´ë»ó 28:8 "So now, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek after all the commandments of the LORD your God in order that you may possess the good land and bequeath [it] to your sons after you forever.
13´ë»ó 28:9 "As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.
13´ë»ó 28:10 "Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be courageous and act."
13´ë»ó 28:11 Then David gave to his son Solomon the plan of the porch [of the temple,] its buildings, its storehouses, its upper rooms, its inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat;
13´ë»ó 28:12 and the plan of all that he had in mind, for the courts of the house of the LORD, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the storehouses of the house of God, and for the storehouses of the dedicated things;
13´ë»ó 28:13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD and for all the utensils of service in the house of the LORD;
13´ë»ó 28:14 for the golden [utensils,] the weight of gold for all utensils for every kind of service; for the silver utensils, the weight [of silver] for all utensils for every kind of service;
13´ë»ó 28:15 and the weight [of gold] for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; and [the weight of silver] for the silver lampstands, with the weight of each lampstand and its lamps according to the use of each lampstand;
13´ë»ó 28:16 and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for each table; and silver for the silver tables;
13´ë»ó 28:17 and the forks, the basins, and the pitchers of pure gold; and for the golden bowls with the weight for each bowl; and for the silver bowls with the weight for each bowl;
13´ë»ó 28:18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the model of the chariot, [even] the cherubim, that spread out [their wings,] and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
13´ë»ó 28:19 "All [this,]" [said David,] "the LORD made me understand in writing by His hand upon me, all the details of this pattern."
13´ë»ó 28:20 Then David said to his son Solomon, "Be strong and courageous, and act; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
13´ë»ó 28:21 "Now behold, [there are] the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God, and every willing man of any skill will be with you in all the work for all kinds of service. The officials also and all the people will be entirely at your command."
13´ë»ó 29:1 Then King David said to the entire assembly, "My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and inexperienced and the work is great; for the temple is not for man, but for the LORD God.
13´ë»ó 29:2 "Now with all my ability I have provided for the house of my God the gold for the [things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the bronze for the [things of] bronze, the iron for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood, onyx stones and inlaid [ stones,] stones of antimony, and stones of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster in abundance.
13´ë»ó 29:3 "And moreover, in my delight in the house of my God, the treasure I have of gold and silver, I give to the house of my God, over and above all that I have already provided for the holy temple,
13´ë»ó 29:4 [namely,] 30000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 70000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings;
13´ë»ó 29:5 of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things of] silver, that is, for all the work done by the craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to the LORD? "
13´ë»ó 29:6 Then the rulers of the fathers' [households,] and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the overseers over the king's work, offered willingly;
13´ë»ó 29:7 and for the service for the house of God they gave 50000 talents and 100000 darics of gold, and 100000 talents of silver, and 180000 talents of brass, and 1000000 talents of iron.
13´ë»ó 29:8 And whoever possessed [precious] stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
13´ë»ó 29:9 Then the people rejoiced because they had offered so willingly, for they made their offering to the LORD with a whole heart, and King David also rejoiced greatly.
13´ë»ó 29:10 So David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly; and David said, "Blessed art Thou, O LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
13´ë»ó 29:11 "Thine, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth; Thine is the dominion, O LORD, and Thou dost exalt Thyself as head over all.
13´ë»ó 29:12 "Both riches and honor [come] from Thee, and Thou dost rule over all, and in Thy hand is power and might; and it lies in Thy hand to make great, and to strengthen everyone.
13´ë»ó 29:13 "Now therefore, our God, we thank Thee, and praise Thy glorious name.
13´ë»ó 29:14 "But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to offer as generously as this? For all things come from Thee, and from Thy hand we have given Thee.
13´ë»ó 29:15 "For we are sojourners before Thee, and tenants, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.
13´ë»ó 29:16 "O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build Thee a house for Thy holy name, it is from Thy hand, and all is Thine.
13´ë»ó 29:17 "Since I know, O my God, that Thou triest the heart and delightest in uprightness, I, in the integrity of my heart, have willingly offered all these [things;] so now with joy I have seen Thy people, who are present here, make [their] offerings willingly to Thee.
13´ë»ó 29:18 "O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve this forever in the intentions of the heart of Thy people, and direct their heart to Thee;
13´ë»ó 29:19 "and give to my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Thy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and to do [them] all, and to build the temple, for which I have made provision."
13´ë»ó 29:20 Then David said to all the assembly, "Now bless the LORD your God." And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed low and did homage to the LORD and to the king.
13´ë»ó 29:21 And on the next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 10000 bulls, 10000 rams [and] 10000 lambs, with their libations and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
13´ë»ó 29:22 So they ate and drank that day before the LORD with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and they anointed [him] as ruler for the LORD and Zadok as priest.
13´ë»ó 29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
13´ë»ó 29:24 And all the officials, the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David pledged allegiance to King Solomon.
13´ë»ó 29:25 And the LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him royal majesty which had not been on any king before him in Israel.
13´ë»ó 29:26 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
13´ë»ó 29:27 And the period which he reigned over Israel [was] forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three [years.]
13´ë»ó 29:28 Then he died in a ripe old age, full of days, riches and honor; and his son Solomon reigned in his place.
13´ë»ó 29:29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the chronicles of Gad the seer,
13´ë»ó 29:30 with all his reign, his power, and the circumstances which came on him, on Israel, and on all the kingdoms of the lands.
14
14´ëÇÏ 1:1 Now Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him and exalted him greatly.
14´ëÇÏ 1:2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' [households.]
14´ëÇÏ 1:3 Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place which was at Gibeon; for God's tent of meeting was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
14´ëÇÏ 1:4 However, David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 1:5 Now the bronze altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD, and Solomon and the assembly sought it out.
14´ëÇÏ 1:6 And Solomon went up there before the LORD to the bronze altar which [was] at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
14´ëÇÏ 1:7 In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."
14´ëÇÏ 1:8 And Solomon said to God, "Thou hast dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness, and hast made me king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 1:9 "Now, O LORD God, Thy promise to my father David is fulfilled; for Thou hast made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
14´ëÇÏ 1:10 "Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can rule this great people of Thine?"
14´ëÇÏ 1:11 And God said to Solomon, "Because you had this in mind, and did not ask for riches, wealth, or honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor have you even asked for long life, but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge, that you may rule My people, over whom I have made you king,
14´ëÇÏ 1:12 wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed, nor those who will come after you. "
14´ëÇÏ 1:13 So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 1:14 And Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen. He had 14000 chariots, and 120000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 1:15 And the king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland.
14´ëÇÏ 1:16 And Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king's traders procured them from Kue for a price.
14´ëÇÏ 1:17 And they imported chariots from Egypt for 600 [shekels] of silver apiece, and horses for 150 apiece, and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.
14´ëÇÏ 2:1 Now Solomon decided to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 2:2 So Solomon assigned 700000 men to carry loads, and 800000 men to quarry [stone] in the mountains, and 36000 to supervise them.
14´ëÇÏ 2:3 Then Solomon sent [word] to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, "As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, so do for me.
14´ëÇÏ 2:4 "Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, dedicating it to Him, to burn fragrant incense before Him, and [to set out] the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on sabbaths and on new moons and on the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, this [being required] forever in Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 2:5 "And the house which I am about to build [will be] great; for greater is our God than all the gods.
14´ëÇÏ 2:6 "But who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? So who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to burn [incense] before Him?
14´ëÇÏ 2:7 "And now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet [fabrics,] and who knows how to make engravings, to [work] with the skilled men whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
14´ëÇÏ 2:8 "Send me also cedar, cypress and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber of Lebanon; and indeed, my servants [will work] with your servants,
14´ëÇÏ 2:9 to prepare timber in abundance for me, for the house which I am about to build [will be] great and wonderful.
14´ëÇÏ 2:10 "Now behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 200000 kors of crushed wheat, and 200000 kors of barley, and 200000 baths of wine, and 200000 baths of oil."
14´ëÇÏ 2:11 Then Huram, king of Tyre, answered in a letter sent to Solomon£º " Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them. "
14´ëÇÏ 2:12 Then Huram continued, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 2:13 "And now I am sending a skilled man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi,
14´ëÇÏ 2:14 the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father, who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone and wood, [and] in purple, violet, linen and crimson fabrics, and [who knows how] to make all kinds of engravings and to execute any design which may be assigned to him, [to work] with your skilled men, and with those of my lord David your father.
14´ëÇÏ 2:15 "Now then, let my lord send to his servants wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which he has spoken.
14´ëÇÏ 2:16 "And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may carry it up to Jerusalem."
14´ëÇÏ 2:17 And Solomon numbered all the aliens who [were] in the land of Israel, following the census which his father David had taken; and 1536000 were found.
14´ëÇÏ 2:18 And he appointed 700000 of them to carry loads, and 800000 to quarry [stones] in the mountains, and 36000 supervisors to make the people work.
14´ëÇÏ 3:1 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where [the LORD] had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
14´ëÇÏ 3:2 And he began to build on the second [day] in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
14´ëÇÏ 3:3 Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God. The length in cubits, according to the old standard [was] sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 3:4 And the porch which was in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height 120; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:5 And he overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.
14´ëÇÏ 3:6 Further, he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim.
14´ëÇÏ 3:7 He also overlaid the house with gold-- the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
14´ëÇÏ 3:8 Now he made the room of the holy of holies£º its length, across the width of the house, [was] twenty cubits, and its width [was] twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, [amounting] to 600 talents.
14´ëÇÏ 3:9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:10 Then he made two sculptured cherubim in the room of the holy of holies and overlaid them with gold.
14´ëÇÏ 3:11 And the wingspan of the cherubim [was] twenty cubits; the wing of one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and [its] other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub.
14´ëÇÏ 3:12 And the wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and [its] other wing of five cubits, was attached to the wing of the first cherub.
14´ëÇÏ 3:13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet facing the [main] room.
14´ëÇÏ 3:14 And he made the veil of violet, purple, crimson and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.
14´ëÇÏ 3:15 He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each [was] five cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 3:16 And he made chains in the inner sanctuary, and placed [them] on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates and placed [them] on the chains.
14´ëÇÏ 3:17 And he erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.
14´ëÇÏ 4:1 Then he made a bronze altar, twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width and ten cubits in height.
14´ëÇÏ 4:2 Also he made the cast [metal] sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height [was] five cubits and its circumference thirty cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 4:3 Now figures like oxen [were] under it [and] all around it, ten cubits, entirely encircling the sea. The oxen [were] in two rows, cast in one piece.
14´ëÇÏ 4:4 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea [was set] on top of them, and all their hindquarters turned inwards.
14´ëÇÏ 4:5 And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, [like] a lily blossom; it could hold 30000 baths.
14´ëÇÏ 4:6 He also made ten basins in which to wash, and he set five on the right side and five on the left, to rinse things for the burnt offering; but the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.
14´ëÇÏ 4:7 Then he made the ten golden lampstands in the way prescribed for them, and he set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
14´ëÇÏ 4:8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred golden bowls.
14´ëÇÏ 4:9 Then he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze.
14´ëÇÏ 4:10 And he set the sea on the right side [of the house] toward the southeast.
14´ëÇÏ 4:11 Huram also made the pails, the shovels, and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of God£º
14´ëÇÏ 4:12 the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars,
14´ëÇÏ 4:13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the pillars.
14´ëÇÏ 4:14 He also made the stands and he made the basins on the stands,
14´ëÇÏ 4:15 [and] the one sea with the twelve oxen under it.
14´ëÇÏ 4:16 And the pails, the shovels, the forks, and all its utensils, Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 4:17 On the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
14´ëÇÏ 4:18 Thus Solomon made all these utensils in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze could not be found out.
14´ëÇÏ 4:19 Solomon also made all the things that [were] in the house of God£º even the golden altar, the tables with the bread of the Presence on them,
14´ëÇÏ 4:20 the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary in the way prescribed;
14´ëÇÏ 4:21 the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold, of purest gold;
14´ëÇÏ 4:22 and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the firepans of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the holy of holies, and the doors of the house, [that is,] of the nave, of gold.
14´ëÇÏ 5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon performed for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver and the gold and all the utensils, [and] put [them] in the treasuries of the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 5:2 Then Solomon assembled to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' [households] of the sons of Israel, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
14´ëÇÏ 5:3 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, that is [in] the seventh month.
14´ëÇÏ 5:4 Then all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
14´ëÇÏ 5:5 And they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils which [were] in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up.
14´ëÇÏ 5:6 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen, that they could not be counted or numbered.
14´ëÇÏ 5:7 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubim.
14´ëÇÏ 5:8 For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles.
14´ëÇÏ 5:9 And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; and they are there to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put [there] at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 5:11 And when the priests came forth from the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to divisions),
14´ëÇÏ 5:12 and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and kinsmen, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, standing east of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets
14´ëÇÏ 5:13 in unison when the trumpeters and the singers were to make themselves heard with one voice to praise and to glorify the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice accompanied by trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and when they praised the LORD [saying, "][He] indeed is good for His lovingkindness is everlasting," then the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,
14´ëÇÏ 5:14 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 6:1 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud.
14´ëÇÏ 6:2 "I have built Thee a lofty house, And a place for Thy dwelling forever."
14´ëÇÏ 6:3 Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.
14´ëÇÏ 6:4 And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled [it] with His hands, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 6:5 'Since the day that I brought My people from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel [in which] to build a house that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel;
14´ëÇÏ 6:6 but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel. '
14´ëÇÏ 6:7 "Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 6:8 "But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.
14´ëÇÏ 6:9 'Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.'
14´ëÇÏ 6:10 "Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in the place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 6:11 "And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with the sons of Israel."
14´ëÇÏ 6:12 Then he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
14´ëÇÏ 6:13 Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 6:14 And he said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no god like Thee in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and [showing] lovingkindness to Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their heart;
14´ëÇÏ 6:15 who has kept with Thy servant David, my father, that which Thou hast promised him; indeed, Thou hast spoken with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day.
14´ëÇÏ 6:16 "Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David, my father, that which Thou hast promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.'
14´ëÇÏ 6:17 "Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, let Thy word be confirmed which Thou hast spoken to Thy servant David.
14´ëÇÏ 6:18 "But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain Thee; how much less this house which I have built.
14´ëÇÏ 6:19 "Yet have regard to the prayer of Thy servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prays before Thee;
14´ëÇÏ 6:20 that Thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which Thou hast said that [Thou wouldst] put Thy name there, to listen to the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place.
14´ëÇÏ 6:21 "And listen to the supplications of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear Thou from Thy dwelling place, from heaven; hear Thou and forgive.
14´ëÇÏ 6:22 "If a man sins against his neighbor, and is made to take an oath, and he comes [and] takes an oath before Thine altar in this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:23 then hear Thou from heaven and act and judge Thy servants, punishing the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.
14´ëÇÏ 6:24 "And if Thy people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against Thee, and they return [to Thee] and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication before Thee in this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:25 then hear Thou from heaven and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back to the land which Thou hast given to them and to their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 6:26 "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against Thee, and they pray toward this place and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin when Thou dost afflict them;
14´ëÇÏ 6:27 then hear Thou in heaven and forgive the sin of Thy servants and Thy people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.
14´ëÇÏ 6:28 "If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, if there is locust or grasshopper, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or whatever sickness [there is],
14´ëÇÏ 6:29 whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Thy people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own pain, and spreading his hands toward this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:30 then hear Thou from heaven Thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest for Thou alone dost know the hearts of the sons of men,
14´ëÇÏ 6:31 that they may fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways as long as they live in the land which Thou hast given to our fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 6:32 "Also concerning the foreigner who is not from Thy people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Thy great name's sake and Thy mighty hand and Thine outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house,
14´ëÇÏ 6:33 then hear Thou from heaven, from Thy dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to Thee, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, and fear Thee, as [do] Thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Thy name.
14´ëÇÏ 6:34 "When Thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray to Thee toward this city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name,
14´ëÇÏ 6:35 then hear Thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
14´ëÇÏ 6:36 "When they sin against Thee (for there is no man who does not sin) and Thou art angry with them and dost deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to a land far off or near,
14´ëÇÏ 6:37 if they take thought in the land where they are taken captive, and repent and make supplication to Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, ' We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, and have acted wickedly ';
14´ëÇÏ 6:38 if they return to Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land which Thou hast given to their fathers, and the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name,
14´ëÇÏ 6:39 then hear from heaven, from Thy dwelling place, their prayer and supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee.
14´ëÇÏ 6:40 "Now, O my God, I pray Thee, let Thine eyes be open, and Thine ears attentive to the prayer [offered] in this place.
14´ëÇÏ 6:41 "Now therefore arise, O LORD God, to Thy resting place, Thou and the ark of Thy might; let Thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let Thy godly ones rejoice in what is good.
14´ëÇÏ 6:42 "O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Thine anointed; remember [Thy] lovingkindness to Thy servant David."
14´ëÇÏ 7:1 Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
14´ëÇÏ 7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the Lord's house.
14´ëÇÏ 7:3 And all the sons of Israel, seeing the fire come down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave praise to the LORD, [saying,] " Truly He is good, truly His lovingkindness is everlasting. "
14´ëÇÏ 7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 7:5 And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 220000 oxen, and 1200000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 7:6 And the priests stood at their posts and the Levites, with the instruments of music to the LORD, which King David had made for giving praise to the LORD-- "for His lovingkindness is everlasting"-- whenever he gave praise by their means, while the priests on the other side blew trumpets; and all Israel was standing.
14´ëÇÏ 7:7 Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat.
14´ëÇÏ 7:8 So Solomon observed the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, [who came] from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 7:9 And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar they observed seven days, and the feast seven days.
14´ëÇÏ 7:10 Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to His people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's palace, and successfully completed all that he had planned on doing in the house of the LORD and in his palace.
14´ëÇÏ 7:12 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.
14´ëÇÏ 7:13 "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people,
14´ëÇÏ 7:14 and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray, and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
14´ëÇÏ 7:15 "Now My eyes shall be open and My ears attentive to the prayer [offered] in this place.
14´ëÇÏ 7:16 "For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.
14´ëÇÏ 7:17 "And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked even to do according to all that I have commanded you and will keep My statutes and My ordinances,
14´ëÇÏ 7:18 then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David, saying, 'You shall not lack a man [to be] ruler in Israel.'
14´ëÇÏ 7:19 "But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them,
14´ëÇÏ 7:20 then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you, and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
14´ëÇÏ 7:21 "As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'
14´ëÇÏ 7:22 "And they will say, 'Because they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them from the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore He has brought all this adversity on them.'"
14´ëÇÏ 8:1 Now it came about at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house
14´ëÇÏ 8:2 that he built the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the sons of Israel there.
14´ëÇÏ 8:3 Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it.
14´ëÇÏ 8:4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he had built in Hamath.
14´ëÇÏ 8:5 He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities [with] walls, gates, and bars;
14´ëÇÏ 8:6 and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule.
14´ëÇÏ 8:7 All of the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
14´ëÇÏ 8:8 namely, from their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed, them Solomon raised as forced laborers to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 8:9 But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel; they were men of war, his chief captains, and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen.
14´ëÇÏ 8:10 And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who ruled over the people.
14´ëÇÏ 8:11 Then Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her; for he said, "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the ark of the LORD has entered."
14´ëÇÏ 8:12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the porch;
14´ëÇÏ 8:13 and [did so] according to the daily rule, offering [them] up according to the commandment of Moses, for the sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts-- the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.
14´ëÇÏ 8:14 Now according to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering before the priests according to the daily rule, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate; for David the man of God had so commanded.
14´ëÇÏ 8:15 And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any manner or concerning the storehouses.
14´ëÇÏ 8:16 Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
14´ëÇÏ 8:17 Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom.
14´ëÇÏ 8:18 And Huram by his servants sent him ships and servants who knew the sea; and they went with Solomon's servants to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to King Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:1 Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions. She had a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices, and a large amount of gold and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart.
14´ëÇÏ 9:2 And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her.
14´ëÇÏ 9:3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house which he had built,
14´ëÇÏ 9:4 the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, she was breathless.
14´ëÇÏ 9:5 Then she said to the king, "It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:6 "Nevertheless I did not believe their reports until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You surpass the report that I heard.
14´ëÇÏ 9:7 "How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:8 "Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king for the LORD your God; because your God loved Israel establishing them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness."
14´ëÇÏ 9:9 Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great [amount of] spices and precious stones; there had never been spice like that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:10 And the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.
14´ëÇÏ 9:11 And from the algum the king made steps for the house of the LORD and for the king's palace, and lyres and harps for the singers; and none like that was seen before in the land of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 9:12 And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested besides [a return for] what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants.
14´ëÇÏ 9:13 Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,
14´ëÇÏ 9:14 besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:15 And King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 [ shekels of] beaten gold on each large shield.
14´ëÇÏ 9:16 And [he made] 300 shields of beaten gold, using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:17 Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
14´ëÇÏ 9:18 And [there were] six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms.
14´ëÇÏ 9:19 And twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like [it] was made for any [other] kingdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:20 And all King Solomon's drinking vessels [were] of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were] of pure gold; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 9:21 For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks.
14´ëÇÏ 9:22 So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
14´ëÇÏ 9:23 And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart.
14´ëÇÏ 9:24 And they brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
14´ëÇÏ 9:25 Now Solomon had 40000 stalls for horses and chariots and 120000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 9:26 And he was the ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River even to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 9:27 And the king made silver [as common] as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland.
14´ëÇÏ 9:28 And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries.
14´ëÇÏ 9:29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
14´ëÇÏ 9:30 And Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 9:31 And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 10:1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
14´ëÇÏ 10:2 And it came about when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard [of it] (for he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 10:3 So they sent and summoned him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 10:4 "Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you."
14´ëÇÏ 10:5 And he said to them, "Return to me again in three days." So the people departed.
14´ëÇÏ 10:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, "How do you counsel [me] to answer this people?"
14´ëÇÏ 10:7 And they spoke to him, saying, "If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
14´ëÇÏ 10:8 But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him.
14´ëÇÏ 10:9 So he said to them, "What counsel do you give that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Lighten the yoke which your father put on us'?"
14´ëÇÏ 10:10 And the young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us.' Thus you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins!
14´ëÇÏ 10:11 'Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I [will discipline you] with scorpions.' "
14´ëÇÏ 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, "Return to me on the third day."
14´ëÇÏ 10:13 And the king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders.
14´ëÇÏ 10:14 And he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I [will discipline you] with scorpions."
14´ëÇÏ 10:15 So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn [of events] from God that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
14´ëÇÏ 10:16 And when all Israel [saw] that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king, saying, "What portion do we have in David? [We have] no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel; Now look after your own house, David." So all Israel departed to their tents.
14´ëÇÏ 10:17 But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
14´ëÇÏ 10:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 10:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
14´ëÇÏ 11:1 Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 1800000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
14´ëÇÏ 11:2 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 11:3 "Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 11:4 'Thus says the LORD, "You shall not go up or fight against your relatives; return every man to his house, for this thing is from Me."' "So they listened to the words of the LORD and returned from going against Jeroboam.
14´ëÇÏ 11:5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 11:6 Thus he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
14´ëÇÏ 11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
14´ëÇÏ 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
14´ëÇÏ 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
14´ëÇÏ 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin.
14´ëÇÏ 11:11 He also strengthened the fortresses and put officers in them and stores of food, oil and wine.
14´ëÇÏ 11:12 And [he put] shields and spears in every city and strengthened them greatly. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
14´ëÇÏ 11:13 Moreover, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him from all their districts.
14´ëÇÏ 11:14 For the Levites left their pasture lands and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 11:15 And he set up priests of his own for the high places, for the satyrs, and for the calves which he had made.
14´ëÇÏ 11:16 And those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD God of Israel, followed them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 11:17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
14´ëÇÏ 11:18 Then Rehoboam took as a wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,
14´ëÇÏ 11:19 and she bore him sons£º Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
14´ëÇÏ 11:20 And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
14´ëÇÏ 11:21 And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his [other] wives and concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
14´ëÇÏ 11:22 And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers, for he [intended] to make him king.
14´ëÇÏ 11:23 And he acted wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities, and he gave them food in abundance. And he sought many wives [for them.]
14´ëÇÏ 12:1 It took place when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong that he and all Israel with him forsook the law of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 12:2 And it came about in King Rehoboam's fifth year, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
14´ëÇÏ 12:3 with 12000 chariots and 600000 horsemen. And the people who came with him from Egypt were without number£º the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
14´ëÇÏ 12:4 And he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 12:5 Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, " Thus says the LORD, 'You have forsaken Me, so I also have forsaken you to Shishak.' "
14´ëÇÏ 12:6 So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, " The LORD is righteous. "
14´ëÇÏ 12:7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves so I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some [measure] of deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak.
14´ëÇÏ 12:8 "But they will become his slaves so that they may learn [the difference between] My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
14´ëÇÏ 12:9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's palace. He took everything; he even took the golden shields which Solomon had made.
14´ëÇÏ 12:10 Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the door of the king's house.
14´ëÇÏ 12:11 And it happened as often as the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards came and carried them and [then] brought them back into the guards' room.
14´ëÇÏ 12:12 And when he humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned away from him, so as not to destroy [him] completely; and also conditions were good in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 12:13 So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
14´ëÇÏ 12:14 And he did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 12:15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? And [there were] wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
14´ëÇÏ 12:16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 13:1 In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 13:2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
14´ëÇÏ 13:3 And Abijah began the battle with an army of valiant warriors, 4000000 chosen men, while Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 8000000 chosen men [who were] valiant warriors.
14´ëÇÏ 13:4 Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel£º
14´ëÇÏ 13:5 "Do you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the rule over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
14´ëÇÏ 13:6 "Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master,
14´ëÇÏ 13:7 and worthless men gathered about him, scoundrels, who proved too strong for Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and timid and could not hold his own against them.
14´ëÇÏ 13:8 "So now you intend to resist the kingdom of the LORD through the sons of David, being a great multitude and [having] with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made for gods for you.
14´ëÇÏ 13:9 "Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests like the peoples of [ other] lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, even he may become a priest of [what are] no gods.
14´ëÇÏ 13:10 "But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the sons of Aaron are ministering to the LORD as priests, and the Levites attend to their work.
14´ëÇÏ 13:11 "And every morning and evening they burn to the LORD burnt offerings and fragrant incense, and the showbread is [set] on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is [ready] to light every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him.
14´ëÇÏ 13:12 "Now behold, God is with us at [our] head and His priests with the signal trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you will not succeed."
14´ëÇÏ 13:13 But Jeroboam had set an ambush to come from the rear, so that [Israel] was in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
14´ëÇÏ 13:14 When Judah turned around, behold, they were attacked both front and rear; so they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.
14´ëÇÏ 13:15 Then the men of Judah raised a war cry, and when the men of Judah raised the war cry, then it was that God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 13:16 And when the sons of Israel fled before Judah, God gave them into their hand.
14´ëÇÏ 13:17 And Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 5000000 chosen men of Israel fell slain.
14´ëÇÏ 13:18 Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah conquered because they trusted in the LORD, the God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 13:19 And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and captured from him [several] cities, Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.
14´ëÇÏ 13:20 And Jeroboam did not again recover strength in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him and he died.
14´ëÇÏ 13:21 But Abijah became powerful, and took fourteen wives to himself; and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
14´ëÇÏ 13:22 Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his words are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo.
14´ëÇÏ 14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place. The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days.
14´ëÇÏ 14:2 And Asa did good and right in the sight of the LORD his God,
14´ëÇÏ 14:3 for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the [sacred] pillars, cut down the Asherim,
14´ëÇÏ 14:4 and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment.
14´ëÇÏ 14:5 He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was undisturbed under him.
14´ëÇÏ 14:6 And he built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was undisturbed, and there was no one at war with him during those years, because the LORD had given him rest.
14´ëÇÏ 14:7 For he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround [them] with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered.
14´ëÇÏ 14:8 Now Asa had an army of 3000000 from Judah, bearing large shields and spears, and 2800000 from Benjamin, bearing shields and wielding bows; all of them were valiant warriors.
14´ëÇÏ 14:9 Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and he came to Mareshah.
14´ëÇÏ 14:10 So Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
14´ëÇÏ 14:11 Then Asa called to the LORD his God, and said, "LORD, there is no one besides Thee to help [in the battle] between the powerful and those who have no strength; so help us, O LORD our God, for we trust in Thee, and in Thy name have come against this multitude. O LORD, Thou art our God; let not man prevail against Thee."
14´ëÇÏ 14:12 So the LORD routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
14´ëÇÏ 14:13 And Asa and the people who [were] with him pursued them as far as Gerar; and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover, for they were shattered before the LORD, and before His army. And they carried away very much plunder.
14´ëÇÏ 14:14 And they destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the LORD had fallen on them; and they despoiled all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.
14´ëÇÏ 14:15 They also struck down those who owned livestock, and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 15:1 Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded,
14´ëÇÏ 15:2 and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin£º the LORD is with you when you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.
14´ëÇÏ 15:3 "And for many days Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law.
14´ëÇÏ 15:4 "But in their distress they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and they sought Him, and He let them find Him.
14´ëÇÏ 15:5 "And in those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for many disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.
14´ëÇÏ 15:6 "And nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress.
14´ëÇÏ 15:7 "But you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work."
14´ëÇÏ 15:8 Now when Asa heard these words and the prophecy which Azariah the son of Oded the prophet spoke, he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD which was in front of the porch of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 15:9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who resided with them, for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
14´ëÇÏ 15:10 So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
14´ëÇÏ 15:11 And they sacrificed to the LORD that day 700 oxen and 70000 sheep from the spoil they had brought.
14´ëÇÏ 15:12 And they entered into the covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and soul;
14´ëÇÏ 15:13 and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
14´ëÇÏ 15:14 Moreover, they made an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with horns.
14´ëÇÏ 15:15 And all Judah rejoiced concerning the oath, for they had sworn with their whole heart and had sought Him earnestly, and He let them find Him. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
14´ëÇÏ 15:16 And he also removed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from the [position of] queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah, and Asa cut down her horrid image, crushed [it] and burned [it] at the brook Kidron.
14´ëÇÏ 15:17 But the high places were not removed from Israel; nevertheless Asa's heart was blameless all his days.
14´ëÇÏ 15:18 And he brought into the house of God the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things£º silver and gold and utensils.
14´ëÇÏ 15:19 And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
14´ëÇÏ 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent [anyone] from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the king's house, and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 16:3 "[Let there be] a treaty between you and me, [as] between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me."
14´ëÇÏ 16:4 So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
14´ëÇÏ 16:5 And it came about when Baasha heard [of it] that he ceased fortifying Ramah and stopped his work.
14´ëÇÏ 16:6 Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah.
14´ëÇÏ 16:7 At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Aram and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand.
14´ëÇÏ 16:8 "Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim an immense army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand.
14´ëÇÏ 16:9 "For the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You have acted foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will surely have wars."
14´ëÇÏ 16:10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
14´ëÇÏ 16:11 And now, the acts of Asa from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 16:12 And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet. His disease was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians.
14´ëÇÏ 16:13 So Asa slept with his fathers, having died in the forty-first year of his reign.
14´ëÇÏ 16:14 And they buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the resting place which he had filled with spices of various kinds blended by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great fire for him.
14´ëÇÏ 17:1 Jehoshaphat his son then became king in his place, and made his position over Israel firm.
14´ëÇÏ 17:2 He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had captured.
14´ëÇÏ 17:3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father David's earlier days and did not seek the Baals,
14´ëÇÏ 17:4 but sought the God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not act as Israel did.
14´ëÇÏ 17:5 So the LORD established the kingdom in his control, and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor.
14´ëÇÏ 17:6 And he took great pride in the ways of the LORD and again removed the high places and the Asherim from Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 17:7 Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
14´ëÇÏ 17:8 and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
14´ëÇÏ 17:9 And they taught in Judah, [having] the book of the law of the LORD with them; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
14´ëÇÏ 17:10 Now the dread of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands which [were] around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
14´ëÇÏ 17:11 And some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks, 77000 rams and 77000 male goats.
14´ëÇÏ 17:12 So Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 17:13 And he had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and warriors, valiant men, in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 17:14 And this was their muster according to their fathers' households£º of Judah, commanders of thousands, Adnah [was] the commander, and with him 3000000 valiant warriors;
14´ëÇÏ 17:15 and next to him [was] Johanan the commander, and with him 2800000;
14´ëÇÏ 17:16 and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, and with him 2000000 valiant warriors;
14´ëÇÏ 17:17 and of Benjamin, Eliada a valiant warrior, and with him 2000000 armed with bow and shield;
14´ëÇÏ 17:18 and next to him Jehozabad, and with him 1800000 equipped for war.
14´ëÇÏ 17:19 These are they who served the king, apart from those whom the king put in the fortified cities through all Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab.
14´ëÇÏ 18:2 And some years later he went down to [visit] Ahab at Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
14´ëÇÏ 18:3 And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me [against] Ramoth-gilead?" And he said to him, "I am as you are, and my people as your people, and [we will be] with you in the battle."
14´ëÇÏ 18:4 Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "Please inquire first for the word of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 18:5 Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" And they said, "Go up, for God will give [it] into the hand of the king."
14´ëÇÏ 18:6 But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:7 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil. He is Micaiah, son of Imla." But Jehoshaphat said," Let not the king say so. "
14´ëÇÏ 18:8 Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micaiah, Imla's son."
14´ëÇÏ 18:9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in [their] robes, and [they] were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
14´ëÇÏ 18:10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, "Thus says the LORD, 'With these you shall gore the Arameans, until they are consumed.'"
14´ëÇÏ 18:11 And all the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will give [it] into the hand of the king."
14´ëÇÏ 18:12 Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, "Behold, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably."
14´ëÇÏ 18:13 But Micaiah said, "As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak."
14´ëÇÏ 18:14 And when he came to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?" He said, "Go up and succeed, for they will be given into your hand."
14´ëÇÏ 18:15 Then the king said to him, "How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:16 So he said, "I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd; And the LORD said, 'These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.'"
14´ëÇÏ 18:17 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:18 And Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
14´ëÇÏ 18:19 "And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this while another said that.
14´ëÇÏ 18:20 "Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ' I will entice him. 'And the LORD said to him,' How? '
14´ëÇÏ 18:21 "And he said, 'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' Then He said, 'You are to entice [him] and prevail also. Go and do so.'
14´ëÇÏ 18:22 "Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; for the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you."
14´ëÇÏ 18:23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?"
14´ëÇÏ 18:24 And Micaiah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day, when you enter an inner room to hide yourself."
14´ëÇÏ 18:25 Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
14´ëÇÏ 18:26 and say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this [man] in prison, and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely."' "
14´ëÇÏ 18:27 And Micaiah said, "If you indeed return safely, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Listen, all you people."
14´ëÇÏ 18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead.
14´ëÇÏ 18:29 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
14´ëÇÏ 18:30 Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone."
14´ëÇÏ 18:31 So it came about when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, "It is the king of Israel," and they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him, and God diverted them from him.
14´ëÇÏ 18:32 Then it happened when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
14´ëÇÏ 18:33 And a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of the chariot, "Turn around, and take me out of the fight; for I am severely wounded."
14´ëÇÏ 18:34 And the battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening; and at sunset he died.
14´ëÇÏ 19:1 Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 19:2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD and so [bring] wrath on yourself from the LORD?
14´ëÇÏ 19:3 "But there is [some] good in you, for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God."
14´ëÇÏ 19:4 So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 19:5 And he appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.
14´ëÇÏ 19:6 And he said to the judges, "Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD who is with you when you render judgment.
14´ëÇÏ 19:7 "Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness, or partiality, or the taking of a bribe."
14´ëÇÏ 19:8 And in Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the heads of the fathers' [households] of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD and to judge disputes among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 19:9 Then he charged them saying, "Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and wholeheartedly.
14´ëÇÏ 19:10 "And whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them that they may not be guilty before the LORD, and wrath may [not] come on you and your brethren. Thus you shall do and you will not be guilty.
14´ëÇÏ 19:11 "And behold, Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Act resolutely, and the LORD be with the upright."
14´ëÇÏ 20:1 Now it came about after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat.
14´ëÇÏ 20:2 Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, "A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, out of Aram and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (that is Engedi)."
14´ëÇÏ 20:3 And Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned his attention to seek the LORD; and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 20:4 So Judah gathered together to seek help from the LORD; they even came from all the cities of Judah to seek the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:5 Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD before the new court,
14´ëÇÏ 20:6 and he said, "O LORD, the God of our fathers, art Thou not God in the heavens? And art Thou not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Thy hand so that no one can stand against Thee.
14´ëÇÏ 20:7 "Didst Thou not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Israel, and give it to the descendants of Abraham Thy friend forever?
14´ëÇÏ 20:8 "And they lived in it, and have built Thee a sanctuary there for Thy name, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 20:9 'Should evil come upon us, the sword, [or] judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before Thee (for Thy name is in this house) and cry to Thee in our distress, and Thou wilt hear and deliver [us].'
14´ëÇÏ 20:10 "And now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom Thou didst not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt (they turned aside from them and did not destroy them),
14´ëÇÏ 20:11 behold [how] they are rewarding us, by coming to drive us out from Thy possession which Thou hast given us as an inheritance.
14´ëÇÏ 20:12 "O our God, wilt Thou not judge them? For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on Thee."
14´ëÇÏ 20:13 And all Judah was standing before the LORD, with their infants, their wives, and their children.
14´ëÇÏ 20:14 Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph;
14´ëÇÏ 20:15 and he said, "Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat£º thus says the LORD to you, 'Do not fear or be dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours but God's.
14´ëÇÏ 20:16 'Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:17 'You [need] not fight in this [battle;] station yourselves, stand and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.' Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out to face them, for the LORD is with you. "
14´ëÇÏ 20:18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with [his] face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:19 And the Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
14´ëÇÏ 20:20 And they rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa; and when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, put your trust in the LORD your God, and you will be established. Put your trust in His prophets and succeed."
14´ëÇÏ 20:21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the LORD and those who praised [Him] in holy attire, as they went out before the army and said, "Give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness is everlasting."
14´ëÇÏ 20:22 And when they began singing and praising, the LORD set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; so they were routed.
14´ëÇÏ 20:23 For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir destroying [them] completely, and when they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
14´ëÇÏ 20:24 When Judah came to the lookout of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, they [were] corpses lying on the ground, and no one had escaped.
14´ëÇÏ 20:25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found much among them, [including] goods, garments, and valuable things which they took for themselves, more than they could carry. And they were three days taking the spoil because there was so much.
14´ëÇÏ 20:26 Then on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore they have named that place "The Valley of Beracah" until today.
14´ëÇÏ 20:27 And every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
14´ëÇÏ 20:28 And they came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres, and trumpets to the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:29 And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:30 So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God gave him rest on all sides.
14´ëÇÏ 20:31 Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He [was] thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
14´ëÇÏ 20:32 And he walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 20:33 The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 20:35 And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted wickedly in so doing.
14´ëÇÏ 20:36 So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
14´ëÇÏ 20:37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, "Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works." So the ships were broken and could not go to Tarshish.
14´ëÇÏ 21:1 Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 21:2 And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat£º Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 21:3 And their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the first-born.
14´ëÇÏ 21:4 Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and some of the rulers of Israel also.
14´ëÇÏ 21:5 Jehoram [was] thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 21:6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab's daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 21:7 Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David because of the covenant which He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and his sons forever.
14´ëÇÏ 21:8 In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah, and set up a king over themselves.
14´ëÇÏ 21:9 Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots with him. And it came about that he arose by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots.
14´ëÇÏ 21:10 So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 21:11 Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray.
14´ëÇÏ 21:12 Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying, "Thus says the LORD God of your father David, 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and the ways of Asa king of Judah,
14´ëÇÏ 21:13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and you have also killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you,
14´ëÇÏ 21:14 behold, the LORD is going to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a great calamity;
14´ëÇÏ 21:15 and you will suffer severe sickness, a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day. '"
14´ëÇÏ 21:16 Then the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who bordered the Ethiopians;
14´ëÇÏ 21:17 and they came against Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king's house together with his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
14´ëÇÏ 21:18 So after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness.
14´ëÇÏ 21:19 Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in great pain. And his people made no fire for him like the fire for his fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 21:20 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed with no one's regret, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
14´ëÇÏ 22:1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older [sons.] So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
14´ëÇÏ 22:2 Ahaziah [was] twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
14´ëÇÏ 22:3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
14´ëÇÏ 22:4 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
14´ëÇÏ 22:5 He also walked according to their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram.
14´ëÇÏ 22:6 So he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
14´ëÇÏ 22:7 Now the destruction of Ahaziah was from God, in that he went to Joram. For when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
14´ëÇÏ 22:8 And it came about when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.
14´ëÇÏ 22:9 He also sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria; they brought him to Jehu, put him to death, and buried him. For they said, "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So there was no one of the house of Ahaziah to retain the power of the kingdom.
14´ëÇÏ 22:10 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 22:11 But Jehoshabeath the king's daughter took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she would not put him to death.
14´ëÇÏ 22:12 And he was hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
14´ëÇÏ 23:1 Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took captains of hundreds£º Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, [and they entered] into a covenant with him.
14´ëÇÏ 23:2 And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers' [households] of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 23:3 Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, "Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has spoken concerning the sons of David.
14´ëÇÏ 23:4 "This is the thing which you shall do£º one third of you, of the priests and Levites who come in on the sabbath, [shall be] gatekeepers,
14´ëÇÏ 23:5 and one third [shall be] at the king's house, and a third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people [shall be] in the courts of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 23:6 "But let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and the ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy. And let all the people keep the charge of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 23:7 "And the Levites will surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house, let him be killed. Thus be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out."
14´ëÇÏ 23:8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss [any of] the divisions.
14´ëÇÏ 23:9 Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had been King David's, which [were] in the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 23:10 And he stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king.
14´ëÇÏ 23:11 Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown on him, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, "[Long] live the king!"
14´ëÇÏ 23:12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came into the house of the LORD to the people.
14´ëÇÏ 23:13 And she looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters [were] beside the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets, the singers with [ their] musical instruments leading the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said, "Treason! Treason!"
14´ëÇÏ 23:14 And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army, and said to them, "Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, put to death with the sword." For the priest said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 23:15 So they seized her, and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house, they put her to death there.
14´ëÇÏ 23:16 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be the Lord's people.
14´ëÇÏ 23:17 And all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down, and they broke in pieces his altars and his images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
14´ëÇÏ 23:18 Moreover, Jehoiada placed the offices of the house of the LORD under the authority of the Levitical priests, whom David had assigned over the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses-- with rejoicing and singing according to the order of David.
14´ëÇÏ 23:19 And he stationed the gatekeepers of the house of the LORD, so that no one should enter [who was] in any way unclean.
14´ëÇÏ 23:20 And he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came through the upper gate to the king's house. And they placed the king upon the royal throne.
14´ëÇÏ 23:21 So all of the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.
14´ëÇÏ 24:1 Joash [was] seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name [was] Zibiah from Beersheba.
14´ëÇÏ 24:2 And Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
14´ëÇÏ 24:3 And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
14´ëÇÏ 24:4 Now it came about after this that Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:5 And he gathered the priests and Levites, and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah, and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and you shall do the matter quickly." But the Levites did not act quickly.
14´ëÇÏ 24:6 So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief [priest] and said to him, " Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the levy [fixed by] Moses the servant of the LORD on the congregation of Israel for the tent of the testimony? "
14´ëÇÏ 24:7 For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
14´ëÇÏ 24:8 So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside by the gate of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:9 And they made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the levy [fixed by] Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness.
14´ëÇÏ 24:10 And all the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought in their levies and dropped [them] into the chest until they had finished.
14´ëÇÏ 24:11 And it came about whenever the chest was brought in to the king's officer by the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, then the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer would come, empty the chest, take it, and return it to its place. Thus they did daily and collected much money.
14´ëÇÏ 24:12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:13 So the workmen labored, and the repair work progressed in their hands, and they restored the house of God according to its specifications, and strengthened it.
14´ëÇÏ 24:14 And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was made into utensils for the house of the LORD, utensils for the service and the burnt offering, and pans and utensils of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
14´ëÇÏ 24:15 Now when Jehoiada reached a ripe old age he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.
14´ëÇÏ 24:16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done well in Israel and to God and His house.
14´ëÇÏ 24:17 But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them.
14´ëÇÏ 24:18 And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.
14´ëÇÏ 24:19 Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the LORD; though they testified against them, they would not listen.
14´ëÇÏ 24:20 Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, "Thus God has said, ' Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD and do not prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has also forsaken you. '"
14´ëÇÏ 24:21 So they conspired against him and at the command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 24:22 Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoiada had shown him, but he murdered his son. And as he died he said, "May the LORD see and avenge!"
14´ëÇÏ 24:23 Now it came about at the turn of the year that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the officials of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
14´ëÇÏ 24:24 Indeed the army of the Arameans came with a small number of men; yet the LORD delivered a very great army into their hands, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash.
14´ëÇÏ 24:25 And when they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
14´ëÇÏ 24:26 Now these are those who conspired against him£º Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
14´ëÇÏ 24:27 As to his sons and the many oracles against him and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 25:1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 25:2 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart.
14´ëÇÏ 25:3 Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king.
14´ëÇÏ 25:4 However, he did not put their children to death, but [did] as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, which the LORD commanded, saying, "Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, nor sons be put to death for fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin."
14´ëÇÏ 25:5 Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to [their] fathers' households under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin; and he took a census of those from twenty years old and upward, and found them to be 3000000 choice men, [ able] to go to war [and] handle spear and shield.
14´ëÇÏ 25:6 He hired also 1000000 valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
14´ëÇÏ 25:7 But a man of God came to him saying, "O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel [nor with] any of the sons of Ephraim.
14´ëÇÏ 25:8 "But if you do go, do [it,] be strong for the battle; [yet] God will bring you down before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down."
14´ëÇÏ 25:9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, "But what [shall we] do for the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?" And the man of God answered, "The LORD has much more to give you than this."
14´ëÇÏ 25:10 Then Amaziah dismissed them, the troops which came to him from Ephraim, to go home; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger.
14´ëÇÏ 25:11 Now Amaziah strengthened himself, and led his people forth, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck down 100000 of the sons of Seir.
14´ëÇÏ 25:12 The sons of Judah also captured 100000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff, and threw them down from the top of the cliff so that they were all dashed to pieces.
14´ëÇÏ 25:13 But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 30000 of them, and plundered much spoil.
14´ëÇÏ 25:14 Now it came about after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites that he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them, and burned incense to them.
14´ëÇÏ 25:15 Then the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, "Why have you sought the gods of the people who have not delivered their own people from your hand?"
14´ëÇÏ 25:16 And it came about as he was talking with him that the king said to him, "Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?" Then the prophet stopped and said, "I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel."
14´ëÇÏ 25:17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us face each other."
14´ëÇÏ 25:18 And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, "The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled the thorn bush.
14´ëÇÏ 25:19 "You said, 'Behold, you have defeated Edom.' And your heart has become proud in boasting. Now stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble that you, even you, should fall and Judah with you?"
14´ëÇÏ 25:20 But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand [of Joash] because they had sought the gods of Edom.
14´ëÇÏ 25:21 So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 25:22 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent.
14´ëÇÏ 25:23 Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits.
14´ëÇÏ 25:24 And [he took] all the gold and silver, and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 25:25 And Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
14´ëÇÏ 25:27 And from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.
14´ëÇÏ 25:28 Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 26:1 And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who [was] sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.
14´ëÇÏ 26:2 He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 26:3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 26:4 And he did right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
14´ëÇÏ 26:5 And he continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the vision of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God prospered him.
14´ëÇÏ 26:6 Now he went out and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the area of] Ashdod and among the Philistines.
14´ëÇÏ 26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites.
14´ëÇÏ 26:8 The Ammonites also gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame extended to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
14´ëÇÏ 26:9 Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the corner buttress and fortified them.
14´ëÇÏ 26:10 And he built towers in the wilderness and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowland and in the plain. [He also had] plowmen and vinedressers in the hill country and the fertile fields, for he loved the soil.
14´ëÇÏ 26:11 Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions, according to the number of their muster, prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officers.
14´ëÇÏ 26:12 The total number of the heads of the households, of valiant warriors, was 26000.
14´ëÇÏ 26:13 And under their direction was an elite army of 3075000, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy.
14´ëÇÏ 26:14 Moreover, Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and sling stones.
14´ëÇÏ 26:15 And in Jerusalem he made engines [of war] invented by skillful men to be on the towers and on the corners, for the purpose of shooting arrows and great stones. Hence his fame spread afar, for he was marvelously helped until he [was] strong.
14´ëÇÏ 26:16 But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
14´ëÇÏ 26:17 Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the LORD, valiant men.
14´ëÇÏ 26:18 And they opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful, and will have no honor from the LORD God."
14´ëÇÏ 26:19 But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense.
14´ëÇÏ 26:20 And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he [was] leprous on his forehead; and they hurried him out of there, and he himself also hastened to get out because the LORD had smitten him.
14´ëÇÏ 26:21 And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son [was] over the king's house judging the people of the land.
14´ëÇÏ 26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first to last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written.
14´ëÇÏ 26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, "He is a leper." And Jotham his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 27:1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
14´ëÇÏ 27:2 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people continued acting corruptly.
14´ëÇÏ 27:3 He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and he built extensively the wall of Ophel.
14´ëÇÏ 27:4 Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded [hills.]
14´ëÇÏ 27:5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that the Ammonites gave him during that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites also paid him this [amount] in the second and in the third year.
14´ëÇÏ 27:6 So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, even all his wars and his acts, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 27:8 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 27:9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 28:1 Ahaz [was] twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do right in the sight of the LORD as David his father [had done.]
14´ëÇÏ 28:2 But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made molten images for the Baals.
14´ëÇÏ 28:3 Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom, and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:4 And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
14´ëÇÏ 28:5 Wherefore, the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they defeated him and carried away from him a great number of captives, and brought [them] to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who inflicted him with heavy casualties.
14´ëÇÏ 28:6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah 1200000 in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 28:7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house and Elkanah the second to the king.
14´ëÇÏ 28:8 And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren 2000000 women, sons, and daughters; and took also a great deal of spoil from them, and they brought the spoil to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 28:9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name [was] Oded; and he went out to meet the army which came to Samaria and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage [which] has even reached heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 28:10 "And now you are proposing to subjugate for yourselves the people of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves. Surely, [do] you not [have] transgressions of your own against the LORD your God?
14´ëÇÏ 28:11 "Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives whom you captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the LORD is against you."
14´ëÇÏ 28:12 Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim-- Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai-- arose against those who were coming from the battle,
14´ëÇÏ 28:13 and said to them, "You must not bring the captives in here, for you are proposing [to bring] upon us guilt against the LORD adding to our sins and our guilt; for our guilt is great so that [His] burning anger is against Israel."
14´ëÇÏ 28:14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the officers and all the assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 28:15 Then the men who were designated by name arose, took the captives, and they clothed all their naked ones from the spoil; and they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them drink, anointed them [with oil,] led all their feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers; then they returned to Samaria.
14´ëÇÏ 28:16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
14´ëÇÏ 28:17 For again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah, and carried away captives.
14´ëÇÏ 28:18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there.
14´ëÇÏ 28:19 For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was very unfaithful to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 28:20 So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
14´ëÇÏ 28:21 Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the palace of the king and of the princes, and gave [it] to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.
14´ëÇÏ 28:22 Now in the time of his distress this same King Ahaz became yet more unfaithful to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 28:23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me." But they became the downfall of him and all Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:24 Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the LORD, and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 28:25 And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.
14´ëÇÏ 28:26 Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 28:27 So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 29:1 Hezekiah became king [when he was] twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
14´ëÇÏ 29:2 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done.
14´ëÇÏ 29:3 In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.
14´ëÇÏ 29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them into the square on the east.
14´ëÇÏ 29:5 Then he said to them, "Listen to me, O Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry the uncleanness out from the holy place.
14´ëÇÏ 29:6 "For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the LORD our God, and have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and have turned [their] backs.
14´ëÇÏ 29:7 "They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:8 "Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
14´ëÇÏ 29:9 "For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
14´ëÇÏ 29:10 "Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that His burning anger may turn away from us.
14´ëÇÏ 29:11 "My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense."
14´ëÇÏ 29:12 Then the Levites arose£º Mahath, the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;
14´ëÇÏ 29:13 and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
14´ëÇÏ 29:14 and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:15 And they assembled their brothers, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:16 So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse [it,] and every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the LORD they brought out to the court of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received [it] to carry out to the Kidron valley.
14´ëÇÏ 29:17 Now they began the consecration on the first [day] of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.
14´ëÇÏ 29:18 Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, "We have cleansed the whole house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils, and the table of showbread with all of its utensils.
14´ëÇÏ 29:19 "Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD."
14´ëÇÏ 29:20 Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the princes of the city and went up to the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:21 And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer [them] on the altar of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
14´ëÇÏ 29:23 Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
14´ëÇÏ 29:24 And the priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel, for the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:25 He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the LORD through His prophets.
14´ëÇÏ 29:26 And the Levites stood with the [musical] instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
14´ëÇÏ 29:27 Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets, [accompanied] by the instruments of David, king of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 29:28 While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded; all this [continued] until the burnt offering was finished.
14´ëÇÏ 29:29 Now at the completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.
14´ëÇÏ 29:30 Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped.
14´ëÇÏ 29:31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, "Now [that] you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD." And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all those who were willing [brought] burnt offerings.
14´ëÇÏ 29:32 And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 29:33 And the consecrated things were 600 bulls and 30000 sheep.
14´ëÇÏ 29:34 But the priests were too few, so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed, and until the [other] priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests.
14´ëÇÏ 29:35 And there [were] also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the libations for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was established [again.]
14´ëÇÏ 29:36 Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:1 Now Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 30:2 For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month,
14´ëÇÏ 30:3 since they could not celebrate it at that time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 30:4 Thus the thing was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:5 So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem. For they had not celebrated [it] in great numbers as it was prescribed.
14´ëÇÏ 30:6 And the couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, "O sons of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that He may return to those of you who escaped [ and] are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
14´ëÇÏ 30:7 "And do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD God of their fathers, so that He made them a horror, as you see.
14´ëÇÏ 30:8 "Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the LORD and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that His burning anger may turn away from you.
14´ëÇÏ 30:9 "For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons [will find] compassion before those who led them captive, and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn [His] face away from you if you return to Him."
14´ëÇÏ 30:10 So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
14´ëÇÏ 30:11 Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 30:12 The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:13 Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly.
14´ëÇÏ 30:14 And they arose and removed the altars which [were] in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and cast [them] into the brook Kidron.
14´ëÇÏ 30:15 Then they slaughtered the Passover [lambs] on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves and consecrated themselves, and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:16 And they stood at their stations after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood [which they received] from the hand of the Levites.
14´ëÇÏ 30:17 For [there were] many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves; therefore, the Levites [were] over the slaughter of the Passover [lambs] for everyone who [was] unclean, in order to consecrate [them] to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:18 For a multitude of the people, [even] many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than prescribed. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon
14´ëÇÏ 30:19 everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though not according to the purification [rules] of the sanctuary. "
14´ëÇÏ 30:20 So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
14´ëÇÏ 30:21 And the sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread [for] seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day after day with loud instruments to the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 30:22 Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight [in the things] of the LORD. So they ate for the appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 30:23 Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate [the feast] another seven days, so they celebrated the seven days with joy.
14´ëÇÏ 30:24 For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly 10000 bulls and 70000 sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly 10000 bulls and 100000 sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.
14´ëÇÏ 30:25 And all the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 30:26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 30:27 Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherim, and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession.
14´ëÇÏ 31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each according to his service, [both] the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 31:3 [He] also [appointed] the king's portion of his goods for the burnt offerings, [namely,] for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the fixed festivals, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 31:4 Also he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 31:5 And as soon as the order spread, the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all.
14´ëÇÏ 31:6 And the sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and placed [them] in heaps.
14´ëÇÏ 31:7 In the third month they began to make the heaps, and finished [them] by the seventh month.
14´ëÇÏ 31:8 And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
14´ëÇÏ 31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him, "Since the contributions began to be brought into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat with plenty left over, for the LORD has blessed His people, and this great quantity is left over."
14´ëÇÏ 31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded [them] to prepare rooms in the house of the LORD, and they prepared [them.]
14´ëÇÏ 31:12 And they faithfully brought in the contributions and the tithes and the consecrated things; and Conaniah the Levite [was] the officer in charge of them and his brother Shimei [was] second.
14´ëÇÏ 31:13 And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah [were] overseers under the authority of Conaniah and Shimei his brother by the appointment of King Hezekiah, and Azariah [was] the [chief] officer of the house of God.
14´ëÇÏ 31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the eastern [gate, was] over the freewill offerings of God, to apportion the contributions for the LORD and the most holy things.
14´ëÇÏ 31:15 And under his authority [were] Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully [their portions] to their brothers by divisions, whether great or small,
14´ëÇÏ 31:16 without regard to their genealogical enrollment, to the males from thirty years old and upward-- everyone who entered the house of the LORD for his daily obligations-- for their work in their duties according to their divisions;
14´ëÇÏ 31:17 as well as the priests who were enrolled genealogically according to their fathers' households, and the Levites from twenty years old and upwards, by their duties [and] their divisions.
14´ëÇÏ 31:18 And the genealogical enrollment [included] all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, for the whole assembly, for they consecrated themselves faithfully in holiness.
14´ëÇÏ 31:19 Also for the sons of Aaron the priests [who were] in the pasture lands of their cities, or in each and every city, [there were] men who were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone genealogically enrolled among the Levites.
14´ëÇÏ 31:20 And thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what [was] good, right, and true before the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 31:21 And every work which he began in the service of the house of God in law and in commandment, seeking his God, he did with all his heart and prospered.
14´ëÇÏ 32:1 After these acts of faithfulness Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and besieged the fortified cities, and thought to break into them for himself.
14´ëÇÏ 32:2 Now when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem,
14´ëÇÏ 32:3 he decided with his officers and his warriors to cut off the [supply of] water from the springs which [were] outside the city, and they helped him.
14´ëÇÏ 32:4 So many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream which flowed through the region, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?"
14´ëÇÏ 32:5 And he took courage and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down, and erected towers on it, and [built] another outside wall, and strengthened the Millo [in] the city of David, and made weapons and shields in great number.
14´ëÇÏ 32:6 And he appointed military officers over the people, and gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 32:7 "Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor because of all the multitude which is with him; for the one with us is greater than the one with him.
14´ëÇÏ 32:8 "With him is [only] an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:9 After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem while he [was] besieging Lachish with all his forces with him, against Hezekiah king of Judah and against all Judah who [were] at Jerusalem, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 32:10 "Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, 'On what are you trusting that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege?
14´ëÇÏ 32:11 'Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and by thirst, saying, "The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?
14´ëÇÏ 32:12 'Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, "You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense"?
14´ëÇÏ 32:13 'Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands able at all to deliver their land from my hand?
14´ëÇÏ 32:14 'Who [was there] among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed who could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
14´ëÇÏ 32:15 'Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less shall your God deliver you from my hand?' "
14´ëÇÏ 32:16 And his servants spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:17 He also wrote letters to insult the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah shall not deliver His people from my hand."
14´ëÇÏ 32:18 And they called this out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city.
14´ëÇÏ 32:19 And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of men's hands.
14´ëÇÏ 32:20 But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and cried out to heaven.
14´ëÇÏ 32:21 And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed every mighty warrior, commander and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in shame to his own land. And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of his own children killed him there with the sword.
14´ëÇÏ 32:22 So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [ others,] and guided them on every side.
14´ëÇÏ 32:23 And many were bringing gifts to the LORD at Jerusalem and choice presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter.
14´ëÇÏ 32:24 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the LORD, and the LORD spoke to him and gave him a sign.
14´ëÇÏ 32:25 But Hezekiah gave no return for the benefit he received, because his heart was proud; therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 32:26 However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah.
14´ëÇÏ 32:27 Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuable articles,
14´ëÇÏ 32:28 storehouses also for the produce of grain, wine and oil, pens for all kinds of cattle and sheepfolds for the flocks.
14´ëÇÏ 32:29 And he made cities for himself, and acquired flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very great wealth.
14´ëÇÏ 32:30 It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.
14´ëÇÏ 32:31 And even [in the matter of] the envoys of the rulers of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him [alone only] to test him, that He might know all that was in his heart.
14´ëÇÏ 32:32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 32:33 So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 33:2 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:3 For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
14´ëÇÏ 33:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD had said, "My name shall be in Jerusalem forever."
14´ëÇÏ 33:5 For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 33:6 And he made his sons pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him [to anger.]
14´ëÇÏ 33:7 Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, "In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;
14´ëÇÏ 33:8 and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances [given] through Moses. "
14´ëÇÏ 33:9 Thus Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the sons of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:10 And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
14´ëÇÏ 33:11 Therefore the LORD brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria against them, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze [chains,] and took him to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 33:12 And when he was in distress, he entreated the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 33:13 When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD [was] God.
14´ëÇÏ 33:14 Now after this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled the Ophel [with it] and made it very high. Then he put army commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 33:15 He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw [them] outside the city.
14´ëÇÏ 33:16 And he set up the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it; and he ordered Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:17 Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, [although] only to the LORD their God.
14´ëÇÏ 33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh even his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are among the records of the kings of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 33:19 His prayer also and [how God] was entreated by him, and all his sin, his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherim and the carved images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of the Hozai.
14´ëÇÏ 33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 33:21 Amon [was] twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 33:22 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD as Manasseh his father had done, and Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and he served them.
14´ëÇÏ 33:23 Moreover, he did not humble himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had done, but Amon multiplied guilt.
14´ëÇÏ 33:24 Finally his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.
14´ëÇÏ 33:25 But the people of the land killed all the conspirators against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 34:1 Josiah [was] eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:2 And he did right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his father David and did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
14´ëÇÏ 34:3 For in the eighth year of his reign while he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the carved images, and the molten images.
14´ëÇÏ 34:4 And they tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars that were high above them he chopped down; also the Asherim, the carved images, and the molten images he broke in pieces and ground to powder and scattered [it] on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
14´ëÇÏ 34:5 Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:6 And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, in their surrounding ruins,
14´ëÇÏ 34:7 he also tore down the altars and beat the Asherim and the carved images into powder, and chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah an official of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 34:9 And they came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the doorkeepers, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:10 Then they gave [it] into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD used it to restore and repair the house.
14´ëÇÏ 34:11 They in turn gave [it] to the carpenters and to the builders to buy quarried stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
14´ëÇÏ 34:12 And the men did the work faithfully with foremen over them to supervise£º Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites of the sons of Merari, Zechariah and Meshullam of the sons of the Kohathites, and the Levites, all who were skillful with musical instruments.
14´ëÇÏ 34:13 [They were] also over the burden bearers, and supervised all the workmen from job to job; and [some] of the Levites [were] scribes and officials and gatekeepers.
14´ëÇÏ 34:14 When they were bringing out the money which had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD [given] by Moses.
14´ëÇÏ 34:15 And Hilkiah responded and said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
14´ëÇÏ 34:16 Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and reported further word to the king, saying, "Everything that was entrusted to your servants they are doing.
14´ëÇÏ 34:17 "They have also emptied out the money which was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hands of the supervisors and the workmen."
14´ëÇÏ 34:18 Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king saying, "Hilkiah the priest gave me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
14´ëÇÏ 34:19 And it came about when the king heard the words of the law that he tore his clothes.
14´ëÇÏ 34:20 Then the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 34:21 "Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD which is poured out on us because our fathers have not observed the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."
14´ëÇÏ 34:22 So Hilkiah and [those] whom the king had told went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her regarding this.
14´ëÇÏ 34:23 And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Tell the man who sent you to Me,
14´ëÇÏ 34:24 thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants, [even] all the curses written in the book which they have read in the presence of the king of Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 34:25 "Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched." '
14´ëÇÏ 34:26 "But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus you will say to him, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel [regarding] the words which you have heard,
14´ëÇÏ 34:27 "Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and [because] you humbled yourself before Me, tore your clothes, and wept before Me, I truly have heard you," declares the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 34:28 "Behold, I will gather you to your fathers and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, so your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants." '"And they brought back word to the king.
14´ëÇÏ 34:29 Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 34:30 And the king went up to the house of the LORD and all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, from the greatest to the least; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 34:31 Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant written in this book.
14´ëÇÏ 34:32 Moreover, he made all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [with him.] So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 34:33 And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the sons of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his lifetime they did not turn from following the LORD God of their fathers.
14´ëÇÏ 35:1 Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover [animals] on the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
14´ëÇÏ 35:2 And he set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 35:3 He also said to the Levites who taught all Israel [and] who were holy to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; it will be a burden on [your] shoulders no longer. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 35:4 "And prepare [yourselves] by your fathers' households in your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of his son Solomon.
14´ëÇÏ 35:5 "Moreover, stand in the holy place according to the sections of the fathers' households of your brethren the lay people, and according to the Levites, by division of a father's household.
14´ëÇÏ 35:6 "Now slaughter the Passover [animals], sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses."
14´ëÇÏ 35:7 And Josiah contributed to the lay people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and kids, all for the Passover offerings, numbering 300000 plus 30000 bulls; these were from the king's possessions.
14´ëÇÏ 35:8 His officers also contributed a freewill offering to the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the officials of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 26000 [from the flocks] and 300 bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the officers of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for the Passover offerings 50000 [from the flocks] and 500 bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood at their stations and the Levites by their divisions according to the king's command.
14´ëÇÏ 35:11 And they slaughtered the Passover [animals], and while the priests sprinkled the blood [received] from their hand, the Levites skinned [ them].
14´ëÇÏ 35:12 Then they removed the burnt offerings that [they] might give them to the sections of the fathers' households of the lay people to present to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. [They did] this also with the bulls.
14´ëÇÏ 35:13 So they roasted the Passover [animals] on the fire according to the ordinance, and they boiled the holy things in pots, in kettles, in pans, and carried [them] speedily to all the lay people.
14´ëÇÏ 35:14 And afterwards they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, [were] offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
14´ëÇÏ 35:15 The singers, the sons of Asaph, [were] also at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers at each gate did not have to depart from their service, because the Levites their brethren prepared for them.
14´ëÇÏ 35:16 So all the service of the LORD was prepared on that day to celebrate the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD according to the command of King Josiah.
14´ëÇÏ 35:17 Thus the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.
14´ëÇÏ 35:18 And there had not been celebrated a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah did with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 35:19 In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign this Passover was celebrated.
14´ëÇÏ 35:20 After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt came up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him.
14´ëÇÏ 35:21 But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What have we to do with each other, O King of Judah? [I am] not [coming] against you today but against the house with which I am at war, and God has ordered me to hurry. Stop for your own sake from [interfering with] God who is with me, that He may not destroy you."
14´ëÇÏ 35:22 However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to make war with him; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to make war on the plain of Megiddo.
14´ëÇÏ 35:23 And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."
14´ëÇÏ 35:24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem where he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
14´ëÇÏ 35:25 Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations to this day. And they made them an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are also written in the Lamentations.
14´ëÇÏ 35:26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of the LORD,
14´ëÇÏ 35:27 and his acts, first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
14´ëÇÏ 36:1 Then the people of the land took Joahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:2 Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:3 Then the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a fine of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
14´ëÇÏ 36:4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Joahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt.
14´ëÇÏ 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
14´ëÇÏ 36:6 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him and bound him with bronze [chains] to take him to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also brought [some] of the articles of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his temple at Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son became king in his place.
14´ëÇÏ 36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 36:10 And at the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the valuable articles of the house of the LORD, and he made his kinsman Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:12 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God; he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke for the LORD.
14´ëÇÏ 36:13 And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear [allegiance] by God. But he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD God of Israel.
14´ëÇÏ 36:14 Furthermore, all the officials of the priests and the people were very unfaithful [following] all the abominations of the nations; and they defiled the house of the LORD which He had sanctified in Jerusalem.
14´ëÇÏ 36:15 And the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent [word] to them again and again by His messengers, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place;
14´ëÇÏ 36:16 but they [continually] mocked the messengers of God, despised His words and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against His people, until there was no remedy.
14´ëÇÏ 36:17 Therefore He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm; He gave [them] all into his hand.
14´ëÇÏ 36:18 And all the articles of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his officers, he brought [them] all to Babylon.
14´ëÇÏ 36:19 Then they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem and burned all its fortified buildings with fire, and destroyed all its valuable articles.
14´ëÇÏ 36:20 And those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia,
14´ëÇÏ 36:21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until seventy years were complete.
14´ëÇÏ 36:22 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia-- in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah-- the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also [put it] in writing, saying,
14´ëÇÏ 36:23 "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people, may the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up!'"
15
15¶ó 1:1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also [put it] in writing, saying,
15¶ó 1:2 "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
15¶ó 1:3 'Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 1:4 'And every survivor, at whatever place he may live, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.' "
15¶ó 1:5 Then the heads of fathers' [households] of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, even everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 1:6 And all those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle, and with valuables, aside from all that was given as a freewill offering.
15¶ó 1:7 Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods;
15¶ó 1:8 and Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
15¶ó 1:9 Now this [was] their number£º 30 gold dishes, 10000 silver dishes, 29 duplicates;
15¶ó 1:10 30 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls of a second [kind, and] 10000 other articles.
15¶ó 1:11 All the articles of gold and silver [numbered] 54000. Sheshbazzar brought them all up with the exiles who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15¶ó 2:1 Now these are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city.
15¶ó 2:2 These came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel£º

15¶ó 2:58 All the temple servants, and the sons of Solomon's servants, were 392.
15¶ó 2:59 Now these are those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, [and] Immer, but they were not able to give evidence of their fathers' households, and their descendants, whether they were of Israel£º
15¶ó 2:60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652.
15¶ó 2:61 And of the sons of the priests£º the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name.
15¶ó 2:62 These searched [among] their ancestral registration, but they could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean [and excluded] from the priesthood.
15¶ó 2:63 And the governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.
15¶ó 2:64 The whole assembly numbered 423600,
15¶ó 2:65 besides their male and female servants, who numbered 73377; and they had 200 singing men and women.
15¶ó 2:66 Their horses were 736; their mules, 245;
15¶ó 2:67 their camels, 435; [their] donkeys, 67200.
15¶ó 2:68 And some of the heads of fathers' [households,] when they arrived at the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to restore it on its foundation.
15¶ó 2:69 According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work 610000 gold drachmas, and 50000 silver minas, and 100 priestly garments.
15¶ó 2:70 Now the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
15¶ó 3:1 Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel [were] in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
15¶ó 3:2 Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.
15¶ó 3:3 So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.
15¶ó 3:4 And they celebrated the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and [offered] the fixed number of burnt offerings daily, according to the ordinance, as each day required;
15¶ó 3:5 and afterward [there was] a continual burnt offering, also for the new moons and for all the fixed festivals of the LORD that were consecrated, and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD.
15¶ó 3:6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid.
15¶ó 3:7 Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
15¶ó 3:8 Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began [the work] and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to oversee the work of the house of the LORD.
15¶ó 3:9 Then Jeshua [with] his sons and brothers stood united [with] Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah [and] the sons of Henadad [with] their sons and brothers the Levites, to oversee the workmen in the temple of God.
15¶ó 3:10 Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of King David of Israel.
15¶ó 3:11 And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, [saying,] " For He is good, for His lovingkindness is upon Israel forever. "And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
15¶ó 3:12 Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' [households,] the old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy;
15¶ó 3:13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.
15¶ó 4:1 Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel,
15¶ó 4:2 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' [households,] and said to them, "Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here."
15¶ó 4:3 But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers' [households] of Israel said to them, "You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us."
15¶ó 4:4 Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and frightened them from building,
15¶ó 4:5 and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15¶ó 4:6 Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
15¶ó 4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his colleagues, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated [from] Aramaic.
15¶ó 4:8 Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows--
15¶ó 4:9 then [wrote] Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,
15¶ó 4:10 and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the region beyond the River. And now
15¶ó 4:11 this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him£º "To King Artaxerxes£º Your servants, the men in the region beyond the River, and now
15¶ó 4:12 let it be known to the king, that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city, and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
15¶ó 4:13 "Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings.
15¶ó 4:14 "Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,
15¶ó 4:15 so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books, and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste.
15¶ó 4:16 "We inform the king that, if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will have no possession in [the province] beyond the River."
15¶ó 4:17 [Then] the king sent an answer to Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of [the provinces] beyond the River£º "Peace. And now
15¶ó 4:18 the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me.
15¶ó 4:19 "And a decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it,
15¶ó 4:20 that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all [the provinces] beyond the River, and that tribute, custom, and toll were paid to them.
15¶ó 4:21 "So, now issue a decree to make these men stop [work,] that the city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me.
15¶ó 4:22 "And beware of being negligent in carrying out this [matter;] why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?"
15¶ó 4:23 Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes' document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.
15¶ó 4:24 Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15¶ó 5:1 When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them,
15¶ó 5:2 then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
15¶ó 5:3 At that time Tattenai, the governor of [the province] beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, "Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?"
15¶ó 5:4 Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building.
15¶ó 5:5 But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report should come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it.
15¶ó 5:6 [This is] the copy of the letter which Tattenai, the governor of [ the province] beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
15¶ó 5:7 They sent a report to him in which it was written thus£º "To Darius the king, all peace.
15¶ó 5:8 "Let it be known to the king, that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with huge stones, and beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is going on with great care and is succeeding in their hands.
15¶ó 5:9 "Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, 'Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?'
15¶ó 5:10 "We also asked them their names so as to inform you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head.
15¶ó 5:11 "And thus they answered us, saying, 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
15¶ó 5:12 'But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, [ who] destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
15¶ó 5:13 'However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
15¶ó 5:14 'And also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor.
15¶ó 5:15 'And he said to him, "Take these utensils, go [and] deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place."
15¶ó 5:16 'Then that Sheshbazzar came [and] laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction, and it is not [yet] completed.'
15¶ó 5:17 "And now, if it pleases the king let a search be conducted in the king's treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this [matter]."
15¶ó 6:1 Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
15¶ó 6:2 And in Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows£º "Memorandum--
15¶ó 6:3 "In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree£º '[ Concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits;
15¶ó 6:4 with three layers of huge stones, and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
15¶ó 6:5 'And also let the gold and silver utensils of the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put [them] in the house of God.'
15¶ó 6:6 "Now [therefore,] Tattenai, governor of [the province] beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials of [the provinces] beyond the River, keep away from there.
15¶ó 6:7 "Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
15¶ó 6:8 "Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God£º the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of [the provinces] beyond the River, and that without delay.
15¶ó 6:9 "And whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, [it] is to be given to them daily without fail,
15¶ó 6:10 that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
15¶ó 6:11 "And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this.
15¶ó 6:12 "And may the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change [it,] so as to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued [this] decree, let [it] be carried out with all diligence!"
15¶ó 6:13 Then Tattenai, the governor of [the province] beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues carried out [the decree] with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent.
15¶ó 6:14 And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
15¶ó 6:15 And this temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15¶ó 6:16 And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.
15¶ó 6:17 And they offered for the dedication of this temple of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel.
15¶ó 6:18 Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
15¶ó 6:19 And the exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month.
15¶ó 6:20 For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover [lamb] for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
15¶ó 6:21 And the sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to [join] them, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate [the Passover.]
15¶ó 6:22 And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
15¶ó 7:1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, [ there went up] Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
15¶ó 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
15¶ó 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
15¶ó 7:4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
15¶ó 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest.
15¶ó 7:6 This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of the LORD his God [was] upon him.
15¶ó 7:7 And some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15¶ó 7:8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
15¶ó 7:9 For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God [was] upon him.
15¶ó 7:10 For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD, and to practice [it,] and to teach [His] statutes and ordinances in Israel.
15¶ó 7:11 Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of the LORD and His statutes to Israel£º
15¶ó 7:12 "Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect [peace.] And now
15¶ó 7:13 I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
15¶ó 7:14 "Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand,
15¶ó 7:15 and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15¶ó 7:16 with all the silver and gold which you shall find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
15¶ó 7:17 with this money, therefore, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their libations and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
15¶ó 7:18 "And whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God.
15¶ó 7:19 "Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.
15¶ó 7:20 "And the rest of the needs for the house of your God, for which you may have occasion to provide, provide [for it] from the royal treasury.
15¶ó 7:21 "And I, even I King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are [in the provinces] beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it shall be done diligently,
15¶ó 7:22 [even] up to 100 talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt as needed.
15¶ó 7:23 "Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, lest there be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons.
15¶ó 7:24 "We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax, tribute or toll [on] any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God.
15¶ó 7:25 "And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in [the province] beyond the River, [even] all those who know the laws of your God; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant [of them.]
15¶ó 7:26 "And whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him strictly, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment."
15¶ó 7:27 Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put [such a thing] as this in the king's heart, to adorn the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,
15¶ó 7:28 and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king's mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the LORD my God upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
15¶ó 8:1 Now these are the heads of their fathers' [households] and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes£º
15¶ó 8:2 of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;
15¶ó 8:3 of the sons of Shecaniah [who was] of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah and with him 150 males [who were in] the genealogical list;
15¶ó 8:4 of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and 200 males with him;
15¶ó 8:5 of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and 300 males with him;
15¶ó 8:6 and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 males with him;
15¶ó 8:7 and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 males with him;
15¶ó 8:8 and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and 80 males with him;
15¶ó 8:9 of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and 218 males with him;
15¶ó 8:10 and of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and 160 males with him;
15¶ó 8:11 and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and 28 males with him;
15¶ó 8:12 and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 males with him;
15¶ó 8:13 and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah and 60 males with them;
15¶ó 8:14 and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud and 70 males with them.
15¶ó 8:15 Now I assembled them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days; and when I observed the people and the priests, I did not find any Levites there.
15¶ó 8:16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers.
15¶ó 8:17 And I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo [and] his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, [that is,] to bring ministers to us for the house of our God.
15¶ó 8:18 And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, 18 men;
15¶ó 8:19 and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men;
15¶ó 8:20 and 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name.
15¶ó 8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions.
15¶ó 8:22 For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, "The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him."
15¶ó 8:23 So we fasted and sought our God concerning this [matter,] and He listened to our entreaty.
15¶ó 8:24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers;
15¶ó 8:25 and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes, and all Israel present [there,] had offered.
15¶ó 8:26 Thus I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils [worth] 100 talents, [and] 100 gold talents,
15¶ó 8:27 and 20 gold bowls, [worth] 10000 darics; and two utensils of fine shiny bronze, precious as gold.
15¶ó 8:28 Then I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the utensils are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
15¶ó 8:29 "Watch and keep [them] until you weigh [them] before the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of the fathers' [households] of Israel at Jerusalem, [in] the chambers of the house of the LORD."
15¶ó 8:30 So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring [them] to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
15¶ó 8:31 Then we journeyed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was over us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way.
15¶ó 8:32 Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
15¶ó 8:33 And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them [were] the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui.
15¶ó 8:34 Everything [was] numbered and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time.
15¶ó 8:35 The exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel£º 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to the LORD.
15¶ó 8:36 Then they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps, and to the governors [in the provinces] beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God.
15¶ó 9:1 Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, [those] of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
15¶ó 9:2 "For they have taken some of their daughters [as wives] for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has intermingled with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hands of the princes and the rulers have been foremost in this unfaithfulness."
15¶ó 9:3 And when I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled.
15¶ó 9:4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering.
15¶ó 9:5 But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God;
15¶ó 9:6 and I said, "O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to Thee, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads, and our guilt has grown even to the heavens.
15¶ó 9:7 "Since the days of our fathers to this day we [have been] in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings [and] our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder and to open shame, as [it is] this day.
15¶ó 9:8 "But now for a brief moment grace has been [shown] from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage.
15¶ó 9:9 "For we are slaves; yet in our bondage, our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
15¶ó 9:10 "And now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Thy commandments,
15¶ó 9:11 which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets, saying, 'The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end [and] with their impurity.
15¶ó 9:12 'So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good [things] of the land and leave [it] as an inheritance to your sons forever.'
15¶ó 9:13 "And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since Thou our God hast requited [us] less than our iniquities [ deserve,] and hast given us an escaped remnant as this,
15¶ó 9:14 shall we again break Thy commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Wouldst Thou not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape?
15¶ó 9:15 "O LORD God of Israel, Thou art righteous, for we have been left an escaped remnant, as [it is] this day; behold, we are before Thee in our guilt, for no one can stand before Thee because of this."
15¶ó 10:1 Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women, and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly.
15¶ó 10:2 And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God, and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
15¶ó 10:3 "So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
15¶ó 10:4 "Arise! For [this] matter is your responsibility, but we will be with you; be courageous and act."
15¶ó 10:5 Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel, take oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath.
15¶ó 10:6 Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he did not eat bread, nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
15¶ó 10:7 And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
15¶ó 10:8 and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
15¶ó 10:9 So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square [before] the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain.
15¶ó 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel.
15¶ó 10:11 "Now, therefore, make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do His will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."
15¶ó 10:12 Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, "That's right! As you have said, so it is our duty to do.
15¶ó 10:13 "But there are many people, it is the rainy season, and we are not able to stand in the open. Nor [can] the task [be done] in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter.
15¶ó 10:14 "Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us."
15¶ó 10:15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.
15¶ó 10:16 But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men [who were] heads of fathers' [households] for [each of] their father's households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.
15¶ó 10:17 And they finished [investigating] all the men who had married foreign wives by the first of the first month.
15¶ó 10:18 And among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers£º Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.

15¶ó 10:24 And of the singers [there was] Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers£º Shallum, Telem, and Uri.

15¶ó 10:41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
15¶ó 10:42 Shallum, Amariah, [and] Joseph.
15¶ó 10:43 Of the sons of Nebo [there were] Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, [and] Benaiah.
15¶ó 10:44 All these had married foreign wives, and some of them had wives [by whom] they had children.

16´À 1:1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, [in] the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol,
16´À 1:2 that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped [and] had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem.
16´À 1:3 And they said to me, "The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire."
16´À 1:4 Now it came about when I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
16´À 1:5 And I said, "I beseech Thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,
16´À 1:6 let Thine ear now be attentive and Thine eyes open to hear the prayer of Thy servant which I am praying before Thee now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Thy servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against Thee; I and my father's house have sinned.
16´À 1:7 "We have acted very corruptly against Thee and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses.
16´À 1:8 "Remember the word which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples;
16´À 1:9 but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell. '
16´À 1:10 "And they are Thy servants and Thy people whom Thou didst redeem by Thy great power and by Thy strong hand.
16´À 1:11 "O Lord, I beseech Thee, may Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant and the prayer of Thy servants who delight to revere Thy name, and make Thy servant successful today, and grant him compassion before this man." Now I was the cupbearer to the king.
16´À 2:1 And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine [was] before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.
16´À 2:2 So the king said to me, "Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart." Then I was very much afraid.
16´À 2:3 And I said to the king, "Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?"
16´À 2:4 Then the king said to me, "What would you request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.
16´À 2:5 And I said to the king, "If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it."
16´À 2:6 Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, "How long will your journey be, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time.
16´À 2:7 And I said to the king, "If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors [of the provinces] beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,
16´À 2:8 and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house to which I will go. "And the king granted [them] to me because the good hand of my God [was] on me.
16´À 2:9 Then I came to the governors [of the provinces] beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
16´À 2:10 And when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard [about it,] it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.
16´À 2:11 So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
16´À 2:12 And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding.
16´À 2:13 So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon's Well and [on] to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire.
16´À 2:14 Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass.
16´À 2:15 So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.
16´À 2:16 And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who did the work.
16´À 2:17 Then I said to them, "You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer be a reproach."
16´À 2:18 And I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me, and also about the king's words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, " Let us arise and build. "So they put their hands to the good [work.]
16´À 2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard [it,] they mocked us and despised us and said, "What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"
16´À 2:20 So I answered them and said to them, "The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right, or memorial in Jerusalem."
16´À 3:1 Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred [and] the Tower of Hananel.
16´À 3:2 And next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
16´À 3:3 Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars.
16´À 3:4 And next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz made repairs. And next to him Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel made repairs. And next to him Zadok the son of Baana also made repairs.
16´À 3:5 Moreover, next to him the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not support the work of their masters.
16´À 3:6 And Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors, with its bolts and its bars.
16´À 3:7 Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, also made repairs for the official seat of the governor [of the province] beyond the River.
16´À 3:8 Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah of the goldsmiths made repairs. And next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16´À 3:9 And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs.
16´À 3:10 Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
16´À 3:11 Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of Furnaces.
16´À 3:12 And next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters.
16´À 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall to the Refuse Gate.
16´À 3:14 And Malchijah the son of Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccherem repaired the Refuse Gate. He built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars.
16´À 3:15 Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, the official of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, covered it, and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and the wall of the Pool of Shelah at the king's garden as far as the steps that descend from the city of David.
16´À 3:16 After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, official of half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs as far as [a point] opposite the tombs of David, and as far as the artificial pool and the house of the mighty men.
16´À 3:17 After him the Levites carried out repairs [under] Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him Hashabiah, the official of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district.
16´À 3:18 After him their brothers carried out repairs [under] Bavvai the son of Henadad, official of [the other] half of the district of Keilah.
16´À 3:19 And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the official of Mizpah, repaired another section, in front of the ascent of the armory at the Angle.
16´À 3:20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the Angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16´À 3:21 After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another section, from the doorway of Eliashib's house even as far as the end of his house.
16´À 3:22 And after him the priests, the men of the valley, carried out repairs.
16´À 3:23 After them Benjamin and Hasshub carried out repairs in front of their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah carried out repairs beside his house.
16´À 3:24 After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah as far as the Angle and as far as the corner.
16´À 3:25 Palal the son of Uzai [made repairs] in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh [made repairs.]
16´À 3:26 And the temple servants living in Ophel [made repairs] as far as the front of the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
16´À 3:27 After him the Tekoites repaired another section in front of the great projecting tower and as far as the wall of Ophel.
16´À 3:28 Above the Horse Gate the priests carried out repairs, each in front of his house.
16´À 3:29 After them Zadok the son of Immer carried out repairs in front of his house. And after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, carried out repairs.
16´À 3:30 After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah carried out repairs in front of his own quarters.
16´À 3:31 After him Malchijah one of the goldsmiths, carried out repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, in front of the Inspection Gate and as far as the upper room of the corner.
16´À 3:32 And between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants carried out repairs.
16´À 4:1 Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews.
16´À 4:2 And he spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy [men] of Samaria and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore [it] for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?"
16´À 4:3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite [was] near him and he said, "Even what they are building-- if a fox should jump on [it,] he would break their stone wall down!"
16´À 4:4 Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity.
16´À 4:5 Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before Thee, for they have demoralized the builders.
16´À 4:6 So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its [height,] for the people had a mind to work.
16´À 4:7 Now it came about when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, [and] that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry.
16´À 4:8 And all of them conspired together to come [and] fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it.
16´À 4:9 But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night.
16´À 4:10 Thus in Judah it was said, "The strength of the burden bearers is failing, Yet there is much rubbish; And we ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall."
16´À 4:11 And our enemies said, "They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them, and put a stop to the work."
16´À 4:12 And it came about when the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, "They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,"
16´À 4:13 then I stationed [men] in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears, and bows.
16´À 4:14 When I saw [their fear,] I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people£º "Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
16´À 4:15 And it happened when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.
16´À 4:16 And it came about from that day on, that half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the breastplates; and the captains [were] behind the whole house of Judah.
16´À 4:17 Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took [their] load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.
16´À 4:18 As for the builders, each [wore] his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter [stood] near me.
16´À 4:19 And I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, "The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another.
16´À 4:20 "At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us."
16´À 4:21 So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared.
16´À 4:22 At that time I also said to the people, "Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day."
16´À 4:23 So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each [took] his weapon [even to] the water.
16´À 5:1 Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
16´À 5:2 For there were those who said, "We, our sons and our daughters, are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live."
16´À 5:3 And there were others who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine."
16´À 5:4 Also there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax [on] our fields and our vineyards.
16´À 5:5 "And now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage [already,] and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others."
16´À 5:6 Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words.
16´À 5:7 And I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, "You are exacting usury, each from his brother!" Therefore, I held a great assembly against them.
16´À 5:8 And I said to them, "We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?" Then they were silent and could not find a word [to say.]
16´À 5:9 Again I said, "The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
16´À 5:10 "And likewise I, my brothers and my servants, are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury.
16´À 5:11 "Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are exacting from them."
16´À 5:12 Then they said, "We will give [it] back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say." So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.
16´À 5:13 I also shook out the front of my garment and said, "Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said, "Amen!" And they praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise.
16´À 5:14 Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, [for] twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor's food [allowance.]
16´À 5:15 But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.
16´À 5:16 And I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
16´À 5:17 Moreover, [there were] at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.
16´À 5:18 Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox [and] six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine [were furnished] in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor's food [allowance,] because the servitude was heavy on this people.
16´À 5:19 Remember me, O my God, for good, [according to] all that I have done for this people.
16´À 6:1 Now it came about when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and [that] no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,
16´À 6:2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent [a message] to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono." But they were planning to harm me.
16´À 6:3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"
16´À 6:4 And they sent [messages] to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way.
16´À 6:5 Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.
16´À 6:6 In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports.
16´À 6:7 "And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, 'A king is in Judah!' And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together."
16´À 6:8 Then I sent [a message] to him saying, "Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind."
16´À 6:9 For all of them were [trying] to frighten us, thinking, "They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done." But now, [O God,] strengthen my hands.
16´À 6:10 And when I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night."
16´À 6:11 But I said, "Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
16´À 6:12 Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered [ his] prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16´À 6:13 He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me.
16´À 6:14 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were [trying] to frighten me.
16´À 6:15 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days.
16´À 6:16 And it came about when all our enemies heard [of it,] and all the nations surrounding us saw [it,] they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
16´À 6:17 Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah's [letters] came to them.
16´À 6:18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
16´À 6:19 Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
16´À 7:1 Now it came about when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
16´À 7:2 that I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
16´À 7:3 Then I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing [guard,] let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house."
16´À 7:4 Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built.
16´À 7:5 Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record£º
16´À 7:6 These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,
16´À 7:7 who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of men of the people of Israel£º
16´À 7:8 the sons of Parosh, 21722;
16´À 7:9 the sons of Shephatiah, 372;
16´À 7:10 the sons of Arah, 652;
16´À 7:11 the sons of Pahath-moab of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, 28188;
16´À 7:12 the sons of Elam, 12544;
16´À 7:13 the sons of Zattu, 845;
16´À 7:14 the sons of Zaccai, 760;
16´À 7:15 the sons of Binnui, 648;
16´À 7:16 the sons of Bebai, 628;
16´À 7:17 the sons of Azgad, 23222;
16´À 7:18 the sons of Adonikam, 667;
16´À 7:19 the sons of Bigvai, 20677;

16´À 7:60 All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants [were] 392.
16´À 7:61 And these [were] they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers' houses or their descendants, whether they were of Israel£º
16´À 7:62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642.
16´À 7:63 And of the priests£º the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them.
16´À 7:64 These searched [among] their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean [and excluded] from the priesthood.
16´À 7:65 And the governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.
16´À 7:66 The whole assembly together [was] 423600,
16´À 7:67 besides their male and their female servants, of whom [there were] 73377; and they had 245 male and female singers.
16´À 7:68 Their horses were 736; their mules, 245;
16´À 7:69 [their] camels, 435; [their] donkeys, 67200.
16´À 7:70 And some from among the heads of fathers' [households] gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 10000 gold drachmas, 50 basins, 530 priests' garments.
16´À 7:71 And some of the heads of fathers' [households] gave into the treasury of the work 200000 gold drachmas, and 22000 silver minas.
16´À 7:72 And that which the rest of the people gave was 200000 gold drachmas and 20000 silver minas, and 67 priests' garments.
16´À 7:73 Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel [were] in their cities.
16´À 8:1 And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had given to Israel.
16´À 8:2 Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women, and all who [could] listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.
16´À 8:3 And he read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
16´À 8:4 And Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam on his left hand.
16´À 8:5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
16´À 8:6 Then Ezra blessed the LORD the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen, Amen!" while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped the LORD with [their] faces to the ground.
16´À 8:7 Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people [remained] in their place.
16´À 8:8 And they read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading.
16´À 8:9 Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest [and] scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep." For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law.
16´À 8:10 Then he said to them, "Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
16´À 8:11 So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved."
16´À 8:12 And all the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them.
16´À 8:13 Then on the second day the heads of fathers' [households] of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law.
16´À 8:14 And they found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
16´À 8:15 So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches, and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of [other] leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written."
16´À 8:16 So the people went out and brought [them] and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate, and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim.
16´À 8:17 And the entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing.
16´À 8:18 And he read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day [there was] a solemn assembly according to the ordinance.
16´À 9:1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth, and with dirt upon them.
16´À 9:2 And the descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
16´À 9:3 While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day; and for [another] fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.
16´À 9:4 Now on the Levites' platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and they cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
16´À 9:5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, "Arise, bless the LORD your God forever and ever! O may Thy glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise!
16´À 9:6 "Thou alone art the LORD. Thou hast made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. Thou dost give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before Thee.
16´À 9:7 "Thou art the LORD God, Who chose Abram And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham.
16´À 9:8 "And Thou didst find his heart faithful before Thee, And didst make a covenant with him To give [him] the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite and the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite-- To give [it] to his descendants. And Thou hast fulfilled Thy promise, For Thou art righteous.
16´À 9:9 "Thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.
16´À 9:10 "Then Thou didst perform signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For Thou didst know that they acted arrogantly toward them, And didst make a name for Thyself as [it is] this day.
16´À 9:11 "And Thou didst divide the sea before them, So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground; And their pursuers Thou didst hurl into the depths, Like a stone into raging waters.
16´À 9:12 "And with a pillar of cloud Thou didst lead them by day, And with a pillar of fire by night To light for them the way In which they were to go.
16´À 9:13 "Then Thou didst come down on Mount Sinai, And didst speak with them from heaven; Thou didst give to them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments.
16´À 9:14 "So Thou didst make known to them Thy holy sabbath, And didst lay down for them commandments, statutes, and law, Through Thy servant Moses.
16´À 9:15 "Thou didst provide bread from heaven for them for their hunger, Thou didst bring forth water from a rock for them for their thirst, And Thou didst tell them to enter in order to possess The land which Thou didst swear to give them.
16´À 9:16 "But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; They became stubborn and would not listen to Thy commandments.
16´À 9:17 "And they refused to listen, And did not remember Thy wondrous deeds which Thou hadst performed among them; So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But Thou art a God of forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness; And Thou didst not forsake them.
16´À 9:18 "Even when they made for themselves A calf of molten metal And said, 'This is your God Who brought you up from Egypt,' And committed great blasphemies,
16´À 9:19 Thou, in Thy great compassion, Didst not forsake them in the wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go.
16´À 9:20 "And Thou didst give Thy good Spirit to instruct them, Thy manna Thou didst not withhold from their mouth, And Thou didst give them water for their thirst.
16´À 9:21 "Indeed, forty years Thou didst provide for them in the wilderness [ and] they were not in want; Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell.
16´À 9:22 "Thou didst also give them kingdoms and peoples, And Thou didst allot [them] to them as a boundary. And they took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon, And the land of Og the king of Bashan.
16´À 9:23 "And Thou didst make their sons numerous as the stars of heaven, And Thou didst bring them into the land Which Thou hadst told their fathers to enter and possess.
16´À 9:24 "So their sons entered and possessed the land. And Thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And Thou didst give them into their hand, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they desired.
16´À 9:25 "And they captured fortified cities and a fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, Fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, and grew fat, And reveled in Thy great goodness.
16´À 9:26 "But they became disobedient and rebelled against Thee, And cast Thy law behind their backs And killed Thy prophets who had admonished them So that they might return to Thee, And they committed great blasphemies.
16´À 9:27 "Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, But when they cried to Thee in the time of their distress, Thou didst hear from heaven, and according to Thy great compassion Thou didst give them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors.
16´À 9:28 "But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before Thee; Therefore Thou didst abandon them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. When they cried again to Thee, Thou didst hear from heaven, And many times Thou didst rescue them according to Thy compassion,
16´À 9:29 And admonished them in order to turn them back to Thy law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Thy commandments but sinned against Thine ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.
16´À 9:30 "However, Thou didst bear with them for many years, And admonished them by Thy Spirit through Thy prophets, Yet they would not give ear. Therefore Thou didst give them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
16´À 9:31 "Nevertheless, in Thy great compassion Thou didst not make an end of them or forsake them, For Thou art a gracious and compassionate God.
16´À 9:32 "Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who dost keep covenant and lovingkindness, Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before Thee, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and on all Thy people, From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day.
16´À 9:33 "However, Thou art just in all that has come upon us; For Thou hast dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
16´À 9:34 "For our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers have not kept Thy law Or paid attention to Thy commandments and Thine admonitions with which Thou hast admonished them.
16´À 9:35 "But they, in their own kingdom, With Thy great goodness which Thou didst give them, With the broad and rich land which Thou didst set before them, Did not serve Thee or turn from their evil deeds.
16´À 9:36 "Behold, we are slaves today, And as to the land which Thou didst give to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, Behold, we are slaves on it.
16´À 9:37 "And its abundant produce is for the kings Whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress.
16´À 9:38 "Now because of all this We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document [are the names of] our leaders, our Levites [and] our priests."
16´À 10:1 Now on the sealed document [were the names of:] Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,
16´À 10:2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
16´À 10:3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
16´À 10:4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
16´À 10:5 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
16´À 10:6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
16´À 10:7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
16´À 10:8 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah. These [were] the priests.
16´À 10:9 And the Levites£º Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
16´À 10:10 also their brothers Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
16´À 10:11 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
16´À 10:12 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
16´À 10:13 Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.
16´À 10:14 The leaders of the people£º Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
16´À 10:15 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
16´À 10:16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
16´À 10:17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
16´À 10:18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
16´À 10:19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
16´À 10:20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
16´À 10:21 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
16´À 10:22 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
16´À 10:23 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
16´À 10:24 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
16´À 10:25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
16´À 10:26 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
16´À 10:27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
16´À 10:28 Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding,
16´À 10:29 are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which was given through Moses, God's servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of GOD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes;
16´À 10:30 and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
16´À 10:31 As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego [the crops] the seventh year and the exaction of every debt.
16´À 10:32 We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God£º
16´À 10:33 for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
16´À 10:34 Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood [among] the priests, the Levites, and the people in order that they might bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers' households, at fixed times annually, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God as it is written in the law;
16´À 10:35 and in order that they might bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree to the house of the LORD annually,
16´À 10:36 and bring to the house of our God the first-born of our sons and of our cattle, and the first-born of our herds and our flocks as it is written in the law, for the priests who are ministering in the house of our God.
16´À 10:37 We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns.
16´À 10:38 And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites shall bring up the tenth of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.
16´À 10:39 For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine and the oil, to the chambers; there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who are ministering, the gatekeepers, and the singers. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.
16´À 11:1 Now the leaders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths [remained] in the [other] cities.
16´À 11:2 And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
16´À 11:3 Now these are the heads of the provinces who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each lived on his own property in their cities-- the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
16´À 11:4 And some of the sons of Judah and some of the sons of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the sons of Judah£º Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez;
16´À 11:5 and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.
16´À 11:6 All the sons of Perez who lived in Jerusalem were 468 able men.
16´À 11:7 Now these are the sons of Benjamin£º Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah;
16´À 11:8 and after him Gabbai [and] Sallai, 928.
16´À 11:9 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
16´À 11:10 From the priests£º Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin,
16´À 11:11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the leader of the house of God,
16´À 11:12 and their kinsmen who performed the work of the temple, 822; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,
16´À 11:13 and his kinsmen, heads of fathers' [households,] 242; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
16´À 11:14 and their brothers, valiant warriors, 128. And their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
16´À 11:15 Now from the Levites£º Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
16´À 11:16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, from the leaders of the Levites, who were in charge of the outside work of the house of God;
16´À 11:17 and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the leader in beginning the thanksgiving at prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
16´À 11:18 All the Levites in the holy city [were] 284.
16´À 11:19 Also the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, who kept watch at the gates, [were] 172.
16´À 11:20 And the rest of Israel, of the priests, [and] of the Levites, [were] in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance.
16´À 11:21 But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
16´À 11:22 Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God.
16´À 11:23 For [there was] a commandment from the king concerning them and a firm regulation for the song leaders day by day.
16´À 11:24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king's representative in all matters concerning the people.
16´À 11:25 Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,
16´À 11:26 and in Jeshua, in Moladah and Beth-pelet,
16´À 11:27 and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns,
16´À 11:28 and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns,
16´À 11:29 and in En-rimmon, in Zorah and in Jarmuth,
16´À 11:30 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba as far as the valley of Hinnom.
16´À 11:31 The sons of Benjamin also [lived] from Geba [onward,] at Michmash and Aija, at Bethel and its towns,
16´À 11:32 at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
16´À 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
16´À 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
16´À 11:35 Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
16´À 11:36 And from the Levites, [some] divisions in Judah belonged to Benjamin.
16´À 12:1 Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua£º Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16´À 12:2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16´À 12:3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16´À 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
16´À 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
16´À 12:6 Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16´À 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua.
16´À 12:8 And the Levites [were] Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, [ and] Mattaniah [who was] in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brothers.
16´À 12:9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in [their] service divisions.
16´À 12:10 And Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,
16´À 12:11 and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.
16´À 12:12 Now in the days of Joiakim the priests, the heads of fathers' [households] were£º of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
16´À 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
16´À 12:14 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
16´À 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
16´À 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
16´À 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
16´À 12:18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
16´À 12:19 of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
16´À 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
16´À 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
16´À 12:22 As for the Levites, the heads of fathers' [households] were registered in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua; so [were] the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian.
16´À 12:23 The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers' [households,] were registered in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
16´À 12:24 And the heads of the Levites [were] Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise [and] give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division.
16´À 12:25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, [and] Akkub were gatekeepers keeping watch at the storehouses of the gates.
16´À 12:26 These [served] in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest [ and] scribe.
16´À 12:27 Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs [to the accompaniment] of cymbals, harps, and lyres.
16´À 12:28 So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,
16´À 12:29 from Beth-gilgal, and from [their] fields in Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.
16´À 12:30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
16´À 12:31 Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate.
16´À 12:32 Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them,
16´À 12:33 with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16´À 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
16´À 12:35 and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; [and] Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
16´À 12:36 and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah [and] Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
16´À 12:37 And at the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
16´À 12:38 The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,
16´À 12:39 and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate, and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
16´À 12:40 Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me;
16´À 12:41 and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with the trumpets;
16´À 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah [their] leader,
16´À 12:43 and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
16´À 12:44 On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.
16´À 12:45 For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David [and] of his son Solomon.
16´À 12:46 For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, [there were] leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God.
16´À 12:47 And so all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated [portion] for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated [portion] for the sons of Aaron.
16´À 13:1 On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
16´À 13:2 because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16´À 13:3 So it came about, that when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.
16´À 13:4 Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah,
16´À 13:5 had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils, and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
16´À 13:6 But during all this [time] I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king,
16´À 13:7 and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
16´À 13:8 And it was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah's household goods out of the room.
16´À 13:9 Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
16´À 13:10 I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given [them], so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field.
16´À 13:11 So I reprimanded the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts.
16´À 13:12 All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.
16´À 13:13 And in charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen.
16´À 13:14 Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services.
16´À 13:15 In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading [them] on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, and they brought [them] into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. So I admonished [them] on the day they sold food.
16´À 13:16 Also men of Tyre were living there [who] imported fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold [them] to the sons of Judah on the sabbath, even in Jerusalem.
16´À 13:17 Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing you are doing, by profaning the sabbath day?
16´À 13:18 "Did not your fathers do the same so that our God brought on us, and on this city, all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath."
16´À 13:19 And it came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates [that] no load should enter on the sabbath day.
16´À 13:20 Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.
16´À 13:21 Then I warned them and said to them, "Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.
16´À 13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. [For] this also remember me, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Thy lovingkindness.
16´À 13:23 In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, [and] Moab.
16´À 13:24 As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the language of his own people.
16´À 13:25 So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take of their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
16´À 13:26 "Did not Solomon king of Israel sin regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin.
16´À 13:27 "Do we then hear about you that you have committed all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?"
16´À 13:28 Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me.
16´À 13:29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
16´À 13:30 Thus I purified them from everything foreign and appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his task,
16´À 13:31 and [I arranged] for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

17´õ 1:1 Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces,
17´õ 1:2 in those days as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which [was] in Susa the capital,
17´õ 1:3 in the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants, the army [officers] of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of his provinces being in his presence.
17´õ 1:4 And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days.
17´õ 1:5 And when these days were completed, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Susa the capital, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
17´õ 1:6 [There were hangings of] fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns, [and] couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
17´õ 1:7 Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king's bounty.
17´õ 1:8 And the drinking was [done] according to the law, there was no compulsion, for so the king had given orders to each official of his household that he should do according to the desires of each person.
17´õ 1:9 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,
17´õ 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king with [her] royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and the princes, for she was beautiful.
17´õ 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him.
17´õ 1:13 Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times-- for it was the custom of the king so [to speak] before all who knew law and justice,
17´õ 1:14 and were close to him£º Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king's presence and sat in the first place in the kingdom--
17´õ 1:15 "According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus [delivered] by the eunuchs?"
17´õ 1:16 And in the presence of the king and the princes, Memucan said, "Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but [also] all the princes, and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 1:17 "For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in to his presence, but she did not come.'
17´õ 1:18 "And this day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's conduct will speak in [the same way] to all the king's princes, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger.
17´õ 1:19 "If it pleases the king, let a royal edict be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti should come no more into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is more worthy than she.
17´õ 1:20 "And when the king's edict which he shall make is heard throughout all his kingdom, great as it is, then all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small."
17´õ 1:21 And [this] word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed.
17´õ 1:22 So he sent letters to all the king's provinces, to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language, that every man should be the master in his own house and the one who speaks in the language of his own people.
17´õ 2:1 After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
17´õ 2:2 Then the king's attendants, who served him, said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.
17´õ 2:3 "And let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to Susa the capital, to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the women; and let their cosmetics be given [them.]
17´õ 2:4 "Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti." And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly.
17´õ 2:5 [Now] there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
17´õ 2:6 who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled.
17´õ 2:7 And he was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle's daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
17´õ 2:8 So it came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to Susa the capital into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king's palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.
17´õ 2:9 Now the young lady pleased him and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king's palace, and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem.
17´õ 2:10 Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make [them] known.
17´õ 2:11 And every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
17´õ 2:12 Now when the turn of each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women-- for the days of their beautification were completed as follows£º six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women--
17´õ 2:13 the young lady would go in to the king in this way£º anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
17´õ 2:14 In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not again go in to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
17´õ 2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, came to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
17´õ 2:16 So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17´õ 2:17 And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17´õ 2:18 Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his princes and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.
17´õ 2:19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
17´õ 2:20 Esther had not yet made known her kindred or her people, even as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther did what Mordecai told her as she had done when under his care.
17´õ 2:21 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 2:22 But the plot became known to Mordecai, and he told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.
17´õ 2:23 Now when the plot was investigated and found [to be so,] they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the king's presence.
17´õ 3:1 After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who [were] with him.
17´õ 3:2 And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage.
17´õ 3:3 Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, "Why are you transgressing the king's command?"
17´õ 3:4 Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
17´õ 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage.
17´õ 3:6 But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him [who] the people of Mordecai [were;] therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
17´õ 3:7 In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month [to month,] until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar.
17´õ 3:8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from [those] of all [other] people, and they do not observe the king's laws, so it is not in the king's interest to let them remain.
17´õ 3:9 "If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the [king's] business, to put into the king's treasuries."
17´õ 3:10 Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17´õ 3:11 And the king said to Haman, "The silver is yours, and the people [also,] to do with them as you please."
17´õ 3:12 Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king's satraps, to the governors who were over each province, and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring.
17´õ 3:13 And letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder.
17´õ 3:14 A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they should be ready for this day.
17´õ 3:15 The couriers went out impelled by the king's command while the decree was issued in Susa the capital; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in confusion.
17´õ 4:1 When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly.
17´õ 4:2 And he went as far as the king's gate, for no one was to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.
17´õ 4:3 And in each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.
17´õ 4:4 Then Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai that he might remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept [them.]
17´õ 4:5 Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king's eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him [to go] to Mordecai to learn what this [was] and why it [was.]
17´õ 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king's gate.
17´õ 4:7 And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
17´õ 4:8 He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for her people.
17´õ 4:9 And Hathach came back and related Mordecai's words to Esther.
17´õ 4:10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him [to reply] to Mordecai£º
17´õ 4:11 "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days."
17´õ 4:12 And they related Esther's words to Mordecai.
17´õ 4:13 Then Mordecai told [them] to reply to Esther, "Do not imagine that you in the king's palace can escape any more than all the Jews.
17´õ 4:14 "For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?"
17´õ 4:15 Then Esther told [them] to reply to Mordecai,
17´õ 4:16 "Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way. And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish."
17´õ 4:17 So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him.
17´õ 5:1 Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace in front of the king's rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace.
17´õ 5:2 And it happened when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter.
17´õ 5:3 Then the king said to her, "What is [troubling] you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it will be given to you."
17´õ 5:4 And Esther said, "If it please the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
17´õ 5:5 Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
17´õ 5:6 And, as they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done."
17´õ 5:7 So Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is£º
17´õ 5:8 if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and do what I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I shall prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says. "
17´õ 5:9 Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai.
17´õ 5:10 Haman controlled himself, however, went to his house, and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.
17´õ 5:11 Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the number of his sons, and every [instance] where the king had magnified him, and how he had promoted him above the princes and servants of the king.
17´õ 5:12 Haman also said, "Even Esther the queen let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king.
17´õ 5:13 "Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17´õ 5:14 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows fifty cubits high made and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it, then go joyfully with the king to the banquet." And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
17´õ 6:1 During that night the king could not sleep so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
17´õ 6:2 And it was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
17´õ 6:3 And the king said, "What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?" Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."
17´õ 6:4 So the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him.
17´õ 6:5 And the king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman is standing in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in."
17´õ 6:6 So Haman came in and the king said to him, "What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?" And Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?"
17´õ 6:7 Then Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king desires to honor,
17´õ 6:8 let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed;
17´õ 6:9 and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.' "
17´õ 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, "Take quickly the robes and the horse as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king's gate; do not fall short in anything of all that you have said."
17´õ 6:11 So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and led him [on horseback] through the city square, and proclaimed before him, " Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor. "
17´õ 6:12 Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning, with [his] head covered.
17´õ 6:13 And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not overcome him, but will surely fall before him."
17´õ 6:14 While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
17´õ 7:1 Now the king and Haman came to drink [wine] with Esther the queen.
17´õ 7:2 And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done."
17´õ 7:3 Then Queen Esther answered and said, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request;
17´õ 7:4 for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king. "
17´õ 7:5 Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?"
17´õ 7:6 And Esther said, "A foe and an enemy, is this wicked Haman!" Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.
17´õ 7:7 And the king arose in his anger from drinking wine [and went] into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king.
17´õ 7:8 Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, "Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?" As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
17´õ 7:9 Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who [were] before the king said, " Behold indeed, the gallows standing at Haman's house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on behalf of the king! "And the king said," Hang him on it. "
17´õ 7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided.
17´õ 8:1 On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had disclosed what he was to her.
17´õ 8:2 And the king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
17´õ 8:3 Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept, and implored him to avert the evil [scheme] of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews.
17´õ 8:4 And the king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king.
17´õ 8:5 Then she said, "If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter [seems] proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
17´õ 8:6 "For how can I endure to see the calamity which shall befall my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17´õ 8:7 So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews.
17´õ 8:8 "Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's signet ring may not be revoked."
17´õ 8:9 So the king's scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces which [extended] from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language, as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language.
17´õ 8:10 And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on steeds sired by the royal stud.
17´õ 8:11 In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city [ the right] to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate the entire army of any people or province which might attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoil,
17´õ 8:12 on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth [ day] of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar).
17´õ 8:13 A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province, was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews should be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
17´õ 8:14 The couriers, hastened and impelled by the king's command, went out, riding on the royal steeds; and the decree was given out in Susa the capital.
17´õ 8:15 Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
17´õ 8:16 For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor.
17´õ 8:17 And in each and every province, and in each and every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree arrived, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen on them.
17´õ 9:1 Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them.
17´õ 9:2 The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm; and no one could stand before them, for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples.
17´õ 9:3 Even all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who were doing the king's business assisted the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them.
17´õ 9:4 Indeed, Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.
17´õ 9:5 Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
17´õ 9:6 And in Susa the capital the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,
17´õ 9:7 and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17´õ 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17´õ 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
17´õ 9:10 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17´õ 9:11 On that day the number of those who were killed in Susa the capital was reported to the king.
17´õ 9:12 And the king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in Susa the capital. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall even be granted you. And what is your further request? It shall also be done."
17´õ 9:13 Then said Esther, "If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
17´õ 9:14 So the king commanded that it should be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged.
17´õ 9:15 And the Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17´õ 9:16 Now the rest of the Jews who [were] in the king's provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and kill 750000 of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17´õ 9:17 [This was done] on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
17´õ 9:18 But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.
17´õ 9:19 Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a] holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions [of food] to one another.
17´õ 9:20 Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
17´õ 9:21 obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually,
17´õ 9:22 because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and [it was a] month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending portions [of food] to one another and gifts to the poor.
17´õ 9:23 Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.
17´õ 9:24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them.
17´õ 9:25 But when it came to the king's attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
17´õ 9:26 Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them,
17´õ 9:27 the Jews established and made a custom for themselves, and for their descendants, and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they should not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation, and according to their appointed time annually.
17´õ 9:28 So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants.
17´õ 9:29 Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
17´õ 9:30 And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, namely, words of peace and truth,
17´õ 9:31 to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations.
17´õ 9:32 And the command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book.
17´õ 10:1 Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
17´õ 10:2 And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
17´õ 10:3 For Mordecai the Jew was second [only] to King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews, and in favor with the multitude of his kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation.
