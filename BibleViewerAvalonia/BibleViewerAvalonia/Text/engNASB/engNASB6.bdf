40原 1:1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
40原 1:2 To Abraham was born Isaac; and to Isaac, Jacob; and to Jacob, Judah and his brothers;
40原 1:3 and to Judah were born Perez and Zerah by Tamar; and to Perez was born Hezron; and to Hezron, Ram;
40原 1:4 and to Ram was born Amminadab; and to Amminadab, Nahshon; and to Nahshon, Salmon;
40原 1:5 and to Salmon was born Boaz by Rahab; and to Boaz was born Obed by Ruth; and to Obed, Jesse;
40原 1:6 and to Jesse was born David the king. And to David was born Solomon by her [who had been the wife] of Uriah;
40原 1:7 and to Solomon was born Rehoboam; and to Rehoboam, Abijah; and to Abijah, Asa;
40原 1:8 and to Asa was born Jehoshaphat; and to Jehoshaphat, Joram; and to Joram, Uzziah;
40原 1:9 and to Uzziah was born Jotham; and to Jotham, Ahaz; and to Ahaz, Hezekiah;
40原 1:10 and to Hezekiah was born Manasseh; and to Manasseh, Amon; and to Amon, Josiah;
40原 1:11 and to Josiah were born Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
40原 1:12 And after the deportation to Babylon, to Jeconiah was born Shealtiel; and to Shealtiel, Zerubbabel;
40原 1:13 and to Zerubbabel was born Abihud; and to Abihud, Eliakim; and to Eliakim, Azor;
40原 1:14 and to Azor was born Zadok; and to Zadok, Achim; and to Achim, Eliud;
40原 1:15 and to Eliud was born Eleazar; and to Eleazar, Matthan; and to Matthan, Jacob;
40原 1:16 and to Jacob was born Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
40原 1:17 Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to [the time of] Christ fourteen generations.
40原 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows. When His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
40原 1:19 And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not wanting to disgrace her, desired to put her away secretly.
40原 1:20 But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
40原 1:21 "And she will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins."
40原 1:22 Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
40原 1:23 "BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD, AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL," which translated means, "GOD WITH US."
40原 1:24 And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took [her] as his wife,
40原 1:25 and kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.
40原 2:1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,
40原 2:2 "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east, and have come to worship Him."
40原 2:3 And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
40原 2:4 And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he [began] to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.
40原 2:5 And they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has been written by the prophet,
40原 2:6 'AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER, WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.' "
40原 2:7 Then Herod secretly called the magi, and ascertained from them the time the star appeared.
40原 2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and make careful search for the Child; and when you have found [Him,] report to me, that I too may come and worship Him."
40原 2:9 And having heard the king, they went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them, until it came and stood over where the Child was.
40原 2:10 And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
40原 2:11 And they came into the house and saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell down and worshiped Him; and opening their treasures they presented to Him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
40原 2:12 And having been warned [by God] in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way.
40原 2:13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the Child and His mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him."
40原 2:14 And he arose and took the Child and His mother by night, and departed for Egypt;
40原 2:15 and was there until the death of Herod, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "OUT OF EGYPT DID I CALL MY SON."
40原 2:16 Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the magi.
40原 2:17 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
40原 2:18 "A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY WERE NO MORE."
40原 2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
40原 2:20 "Arise and take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life are dead."
40原 2:21 And he arose and took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
40原 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned [by God] in a dream, he departed for the regions of Galilee,
40原 2:23 and came and resided in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
40原 3:1 Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
40原 3:2 "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40原 3:3 For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet, saying, " THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!'"
40原 3:4 Now John himself had a garment of camel's hair, and a leather belt about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
40原 3:5 Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea, and all the district around the Jordan;
40原 3:6 and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
40原 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
40原 3:8 "Therefore bring forth fruit in keeping with repentance;
40原 3:9 and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father'; for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
40原 3:10 "And the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40原 3:11 "As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
40原 3:12 "And His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
40原 3:13 Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan [coming] to John, to be baptized by him.
40原 3:14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?"
40原 3:15 But Jesus answering said to him, "Permit [it] at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he *permitted Him.
40原 3:16 And after being baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, [and] coming upon Him,
40原 3:17 and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased."
40原 4:1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
40原 4:2 And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then became hungry.
40原 4:3 And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
40原 4:4 But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'"
40原 4:5 Then the devil *took Him into the holy city; and he had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,
40原 4:6 and *said to Him, "If You are the Son of God throw Yourself down; for it is written, 'HE WILL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE CONCERNING YOU'; and ' ON [their] HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE. '"
40原 4:7 Jesus said to him, "On the other hand, it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'"
40原 4:8 Again, the devil *took Him to a very high mountain, and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
40原 4:9 and he said to Him, "All these things will I give You, if You fall down and worship me."
40原 4:10 Then Jesus *said to him, "Begone, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'"
40原 4:11 Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and [began] to minister to Him.
40原 4:12 Now when He heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee;
40原 4:13 and leaving Nazareth, He came and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
40原 4:14 [This was] to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
40原 4:15 "THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES--
40原 4:16 "THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING IN DARKNESS SAW A GREAT LIGHT, AND TO THOSE WHO WERE SITTING IN THE LAND AND SHADOW OF DEATH, UPON THEM A LIGHT DAWNED."
40原 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40原 4:18 And walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
40原 4:19 And He *said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
40原 4:20 And they immediately left the nets, and followed Him.
40原 4:21 And going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.
40原 4:22 And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
40原 4:23 And [Jesus] was going about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
40原 4:24 And the news about Him went out into all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He healed them.
40原 4:25 And great multitudes followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and [from] beyond the Jordan.
40原 5:1 And when He saw the multitudes, He went up on the mountain; and after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
40原 5:2 And opening His mouth He [began] to teach them, saying,
40原 5:3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40原 5:4 "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
40原 5:5 "Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
40原 5:6 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
40原 5:7 "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
40原 5:8 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
40原 5:9 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
40原 5:10 "Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40原 5:11 "Blessed are you when [men] cast insults at you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, on account of Me.
40原 5:12 "Rejoice, and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
40原 5:13 "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how will it be made salty [again]? It is good for nothing anymore, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
40原 5:14 "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
40原 5:15 "Nor do [men] light a lamp, and put it under the peck-measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house.
40原 5:16 "Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
40原 5:17 "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
40原 5:18 "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.
40原 5:19 "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches [them,] he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40原 5:20 "For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpasses [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
40原 5:21 "You have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.'
40原 5:22 "But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever shall say, 'You fool,' shall be guilty [enough to go] into the fiery hell.
40原 5:23 "If therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
40原 5:24 leave your offering there before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.
40原 5:25 "Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, in order that your opponent may not deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
40原 5:26 "Truly I say to you, you shall not come out of there, until you have paid up the last cent.
40原 5:27 "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY';
40原 5:28 but I say to you, that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
40原 5:29 "And if your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out, and throw it from you; for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40原 5:30 "And if your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off, and throw it from you; for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish, than for your whole body to go into hell.
40原 5:31 "And it was said, 'WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE';
40原 5:32 but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for [the] cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
40原 5:33 "Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FALSE VOWS, BUT SHALL FULFILL YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD.'
40原 5:34 "But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
40原 5:35 or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING.
40原 5:36 "Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
40原 5:37 "But let your statement be, 'Yes, yes' [or] 'No, no'; and anything beyond these is of evil.
40原 5:38 "You have heard that it was said, 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.'
40原 5:39 "But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40原 5:40 "And if anyone wants to sue you, and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
40原 5:41 "And whoever shall force you to go one mile, go with him two.
40原 5:42 "Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
40原 5:43 "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR, and hate your enemy.'
40原 5:44 "But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you
40原 5:45 in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on [the] evil and [the] good, and sends rain on [the] righteous and [the] unrighteous.
40原 5:46 "For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax-gatherers do the same?
40原 5:47 "And if you greet your brothers only, what do you do more [than others]? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
40原 5:48 "Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
40原 6:1 "Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
40原 6:2 "When therefore you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
40原 6:3 "But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
40原 6:4 that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
40原 6:5 "And when you pray, you are not to be as the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, in order to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
40原 6:6 "But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
40原 6:7 "And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition, as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.
40原 6:8 "Therefore do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need, before you ask Him.
40原 6:9 "Pray, then, in this way 'Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name.
40原 6:10 'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.
40原 6:11 'Give us this day our daily bread.
40原 6:12 'And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40原 6:13 'And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. {For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.}'
40原 6:14 "For if you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40原 6:15 "But if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.
40原 6:16 "And whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites [do,] for they neglect their appearance in order to be seen fasting by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
40原 6:17 "But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face
40原 6:18 so that you may not be seen fasting by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
40原 6:19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
40原 6:20 "But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;
40原 6:21 for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
40原 6:22 "The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
40原 6:23 "But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
40原 6:24 "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
40原 6:25 "For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, [as to] what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, [as to] what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than clothing?
40原 6:26 "Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, and [yet] your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
40原 6:27 "And which of you by being anxious can add a [single] cubit to his life's span?
40原 6:28 "And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,
40原 6:29 yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory did not clothe himself like one of these.
40原 6:30 "But if God so arrays the grass of the field, which is [alive] today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, [will He] not much more [do so for] you, O men of little faith?
40原 6:31 "Do not be anxious then, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'With what shall we clothe ourselves?'
40原 6:32 "For all these things the Gentiles eagerly seek; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
40原 6:33 "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.
40原 6:34 "Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. [Each] day has enough trouble of its own.
40原 7:1 "Do not judge lest you be judged.
40原 7:2 "For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
40原 7:3 "And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
40原 7:4 "Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and behold, the log is in your own eye?
40原 7:5 "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
40原 7:6 "Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
40原 7:7 "Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
40原 7:8 "For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.
40原 7:9 "Or what man is there among you, when his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone?
40原 7:10 "Or if he shall ask for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?
40原 7:11 "If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!
40原 7:12 "Therefore, however you want people to treat you, so treat them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
40原 7:13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it.
40原 7:14 "For the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life, and few are those who find it.
40原 7:15 "Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
40原 7:16 "You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn [bushes,] nor figs from thistles, are they?
40原 7:17 "Even so, every good tree bears good fruit; but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
40原 7:18 "A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
40原 7:19 "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40原 7:20 "So then, you will know them by their fruits.
40原 7:21 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven.
40原 7:22 "Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'
40原 7:23 "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'
40原 7:24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts upon them, may be compared to a wise man, who built his house upon the rock.
40原 7:25 "And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and burst against that house; and [yet] it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock.
40原 7:26 "And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act upon them, will be like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.
40原 7:27 "And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and burst against that house; and it fell, and great was its fall."
40原 7:28 The result was that when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were amazed at His teaching;
40原 7:29 for He was teaching them as [one] having authority, and not as their scribes.
40原 8:1 And when He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
40原 8:2 And behold, a leper came to Him, and bowed down to Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
40原 8:3 And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
40原 8:4 And Jesus *said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and present the offering that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
40原 8:5 And when He had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, entreating Him,
40原 8:6 and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering great pain."
40原 8:7 And He *said to him, "I will come and heal him."
40原 8:8 But the centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
40原 8:9 "For I, too, am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does [it]."
40原 8:10 Now when Jesus heard [this,] He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.
40原 8:11 "And I say to you, that many shall come from east and west, and recline [at the table] with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
40原 8:12 but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. "
40原 8:13 And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; let it be done to you as you have believed." And the servant was healed that [very] hour.
40原 8:14 And when Jesus had come to Peter's home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever.
40原 8:15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and waited on Him.
40原 8:16 And when evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill
40原 8:17 in order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES, AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES."
40原 8:18 Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.
40原 8:19 And a certain scribe came and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
40原 8:20 And Jesus *said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
40原 8:21 And another of the disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
40原 8:22 But Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me; and allow the dead to bury their own dead."
40原 8:23 And when He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
40原 8:24 And behold, there arose a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves; but He Himself was asleep.
40原 8:25 And they came to [Him,] and awoke Him, saying, "Save [us,] Lord; we are perishing!"
40原 8:26 And He *said to them, "Why are you timid, you men of little faith?" Then He arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and it became perfectly calm.
40原 8:27 And the men marveled, saying, "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"
40原 8:28 And when He had come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of the tombs; [they were] so exceedingly violent that no one could pass by that road.
40原 8:29 And behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
40原 8:30 Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.
40原 8:31 And the demons [began] to entreat Him, saying, "If You are [going to] cast us out, send us into the herd of swine."
40原 8:32 And He said to them, "Begone!" And they came out, and went into the swine, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
40原 8:33 And the herdsmen ran away, and went to the city, and reported everything, including the [incident] of the demoniacs.
40原 8:34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated [Him] to depart from their region.
40原 9:1 And getting into a boat, He crossed over, and came to His own city.
40原 9:2 And behold, they were bringing to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed; and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, "Take courage, My son, your sins are forgiven."
40原 9:3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This [fellow] blasphemes."
40原 9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?
40原 9:5 "For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, ' Rise, and walk '?
40原 9:6 "But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-- then He *said to the paralytic-- "Rise, take up your bed, and go home."
40原 9:7 And he rose, and went home.
40原 9:8 But when the multitudes saw [this,] they were filled with awe, and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
40原 9:9 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office; and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he rose, and followed Him.
40原 9:10 And it happened that as He was reclining [at the table] in the house, behold many tax-gatherers and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples.
40原 9:11 And when the Pharisees saw [this,] they said to His disciples, "Why is your Teacher eating with the tax-gatherers and sinners?"
40原 9:12 But when He heard this, He said, "[It is] not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick.
40原 9:13 "But go and learn what [this] means, 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT SACRIFICE,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
40原 9:14 Then the disciples of John *came to Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
40原 9:15 And Jesus said to them, "The attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
40原 9:16 "But no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.
40原 9:17 "Nor do [men] put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
40原 9:18 While He was saying these things to them, behold, there came a [synagogue] official, and bowed down before Him, saying, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live."
40原 9:19 And Jesus rose and [began] to follow him, and [so did] His disciples.
40原 9:20 And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak;
40原 9:21 for she was saying to herself, "If I only touch His garment, I shall get well."
40原 9:22 But Jesus turning and seeing her said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well." And at once the woman was made well.
40原 9:23 And when Jesus came into the official's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
40原 9:24 He [began] to say, "Depart; for the girl has not died, but is asleep." And they [began] laughing at Him.
40原 9:25 But when the crowd had been put out, He entered and took her by the hand; and the girl arose.
40原 9:26 And this news went out into all that land.
40原 9:27 And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40原 9:28 And after He had come into the house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus *said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They *said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
40原 9:29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "Be it done to you according to your faith."
40原 9:30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, " See [here,] let no one know [about this]! "
40原 9:31 But they went out, and spread the news about Him in all that land.
40原 9:32 And as they were going out, behold, a dumb man, demon-possessed, was brought to Him.
40原 9:33 And after the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel."
40原 9:34 But the Pharisees were saying, "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons."
40原 9:35 And Jesus was going about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
40原 9:36 And seeing the multitudes, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd.
40原 9:37 Then He *said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
40原 9:38 "Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
40原 10:1 And having summoned His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
40原 10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;
40原 10:3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40原 10:4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.
40原 10:5 These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them, saying, "Do not go in [the] way of [the] Gentiles, and do not enter [any] city of the Samaritans;
40原 10:6 but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
40原 10:7 "And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
40原 10:8 "Heal [the] sick, raise [the] dead, cleanse [the] lepers, cast out demons; freely you received, freely give.
40原 10:9 "Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts,
40原 10:10 or a bag for [your] journey, or even two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his support.
40原 10:11 "And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it; and abide there until you go away.
40原 10:12 "And as you enter the house, give it your greeting.
40原 10:13 "And if the house is worthy, let your [greeting of] peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your [greeting of] peace return to you.
40原 10:14 "And whoever does not receive you, nor heed your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.
40原 10:15 "Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for [the] land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
40原 10:16 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be shrewd as serpents, and innocent as doves.
40原 10:17 "But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to [the] courts, and scourge you in their synagogues;
40原 10:18 and you shall even be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
40原 10:19 "But when they deliver you up, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak; for it shall be given you in that hour what you are to speak.
40原 10:20 "For it is not you who speak, but [it is] the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
40原 10:21 "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father [his] child; and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
40原 10:22 "And you will be hated by all on account of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.
40原 10:23 "But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to the next; for truly I say to you, you shall not finish [going through] the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man comes.
40原 10:24 "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.
40原 10:25 "It is enough for the disciple that he become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!
40原 10:26 "Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.
40原 10:27 "What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear [whispered] in [your] ear, proclaim upon the housetops.
40原 10:28 "And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
40原 10:29 "Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And [yet] not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
40原 10:30 "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
40原 10:31 "Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.
40原 10:32 "Everyone therefore who shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.
40原 10:33 "But whoever shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.
40原 10:34 "Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40原 10:35 "For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A Daughter-in-law AGAINST HER Mother-in-law;
40原 10:36 and A Man's ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.
40原 10:37 "He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
40原 10:38 "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
40原 10:39 "He who has found his life shall lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake shall find it.
40原 10:40 "He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
40原 10:41 "He who receives a prophet in [the] name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
40原 10:42 "And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you he shall not lose his reward."
40原 11:1 And it came about that when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
40原 11:2 Now when John in prison heard of the works of Christ, he sent [word] by his disciples,
40原 11:3 and said to Him, "Are You the Expected One, or shall we look for someone else?"
40原 11:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you hear and see
40原 11:5 [the] BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT and [the] lame walk, [the] lepers are cleansed and [the] deaf hear, and [the] dead are raised up, and [the] POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
40原 11:6 "And blessed is he who keeps from stumbling over Me."
40原 11:7 And as these were going [away,] Jesus began to speak to the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
40原 11:8 "But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft [clothing]? Behold, those who wear soft [clothing] are in kings' palaces.
40原 11:9 "But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.
40原 11:10 "This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'
40原 11:11 "Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen [anyone] greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40原 11:12 "And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.
40原 11:13 "For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40原 11:14 "And if you care to accept [it,] he himself is Elijah, who was to come.
40原 11:15 "He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
40原 11:16 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the market places, who call out to the other [children],
40原 11:17 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
40原 11:18 "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon!'
40原 11:19 "The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds."
40原 11:20 Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent.
40原 11:21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40原 11:22 "Nevertheless I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in [the] day of judgment, than for you.
40原 11:23 "And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You shall descend to Hades; for if the miracles had occurred in Sodom which occurred in you, it would have remained to this day.
40原 11:24 "Nevertheless I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in [the] day of judgment, than for you."
40原 11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou didst hide these things from [the] wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes.
40原 11:26 "Yes, Father, for thus it was well-pleasing in Thy sight.
40原 11:27 "All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him.]
40原 11:28 "Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
40原 11:29 "Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and YOU SHALL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS.
40原 11:30 "For My yoke is easy, and My load is light."
40原 12:1 At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields, and His disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads [of grain] and eat.
40原 12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Behold, Your disciples do what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath."
40原 12:3 But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did, when he became hungry, he and his companions;
40原 12:4 how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests alone?
40原 12:5 "Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath, and are innocent?
40原 12:6 "But I say to you, that something greater than the temple is here.
40原 12:7 "But if you had known what this means, 'I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
40原 12:8 "For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40原 12:9 And departing from there, He went into their synagogue.
40原 12:10 And behold, [there was] a man with a withered hand. And they questioned Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"-- in order that they might accuse Him.
40原 12:11 And He said to them, "What man shall there be among you, who shall have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it, and lift it out?
40原 12:12 "Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
40原 12:13 Then He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And he stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.
40原 12:14 But the Pharisees went out, and counseled together against Him, [as to] how they might destroy Him.
40原 12:15 But Jesus, aware of [this,] withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all,
40原 12:16 and warned them not to make Him known,
40原 12:17 in order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying,
40原 12:18 "BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN; MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL is Well-pleased; I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE SHALL PROCLAIM JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES.
40原 12:19 "HE WILL NOT QUARREL, NOR CRY OUT; NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS.
40原 12:20 "A BATTERED REED HE WILL NOT BREAK OFF, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE WILL NOT PUT OUT, UNTIL HE LEADS JUSTICE TO VICTORY.
40原 12:21 "AND IN HIS NAME THE GENTILES WILL HOPE."
40原 12:22 Then there was brought to Him a demon-possessed man [who was] blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
40原 12:23 And all the multitudes were amazed, and [began] to say, "This [man] cannot be the Son of David, can he?"
40原 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons."
40原 12:25 And knowing their thoughts He said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
40原 12:26 "And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
40原 12:27 "And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Consequently they shall be your judges.
40原 12:28 "But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
40原 12:29 "Or how can anyone enter the strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong [man]? And then he will plunder his house.
40原 12:30 "He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
40原 12:31 "Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
40原 12:32 "And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age, or in the [age] to come.
40原 12:33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit.
40原 12:34 "You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
40原 12:35 "The good man out of [his] good treasure brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of [his] evil treasure brings forth what is evil.
40原 12:36 "And I say to you, that every careless word that men shall speak, they shall render account for it in the day of judgment.
40原 12:37 "For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."
40原 12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from You."
40原 12:39 But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and [yet] no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;
40原 12:40 for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
40原 12:41 "The men of Nineveh shall stand up with this generation at the judgment, and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
40原 12:42 "[The] Queen of [the] South shall rise up with this generation at the judgment and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
40原 12:43 "Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find [it.]
40原 12:44 "Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came'; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.
40原 12:45 "Then it goes, and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation."
40原 12:46 While He was still speaking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him.
40原 12:47 And someone said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You."
40原 12:48 But He answered the one who was telling Him and said, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?"
40原 12:49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold, My mother and My brothers!
40原 12:50 "For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother."
40原 13:1 On that day Jesus went out of the house, and was sitting by the sea.
40原 13:2 And great multitudes gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole multitude was standing on the beach.
40原 13:3 And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, "Behold, the sower went out to sow;
40原 13:4 and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.
40原 13:5 "And others fell upon the rocky places, where they did not have much soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil.
40原 13:6 "But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
40原 13:7 "And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out.
40原 13:8 "And others fell on the good soil, and *yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
40原 13:9 "He who has ears, let him hear."
40原 13:10 And the disciples came and said to Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
40原 13:11 And He answered and said to them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
40原 13:12 "For whoever has, to him shall [more] be given, and he shall have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
40原 13:13 "Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
40原 13:14 "And in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, 'YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;
40原 13:15 FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES LEST THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I SHOULD HEAL THEM. '
40原 13:16 "But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
40原 13:17 "For truly I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see [it]; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear [it].
40原 13:18 "Hear then the parable of the sower.
40原 13:19 "When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the evil [one] comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road.
40原 13:20 "And the one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the man who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy;
40原 13:21 yet he has no [firm] root in himself, but is [only] temporary, and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.
40原 13:22 "And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man who hears the word, and the worry of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
40原 13:23 "And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty."
40原 13:24 He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40原 13:25 "But while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
40原 13:26 "But when the wheat sprang up and bore grain, then the tares became evident also.
40原 13:27 "And the slaves of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?'
40原 13:28 "And he said to them, 'An enemy has done this!' And the slaves *said to him, 'Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?'
40原 13:29 "But he *said, 'No; lest while you are gathering up the tares, you may root up the wheat with them.
40原 13:30 'Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn."' "
40原 13:31 He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;
40原 13:32 and this is smaller than all [other] seeds; but when it is full grown, it is larger than the garden plants, and becomes a tree, so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR come and NEST IN ITS BRANCHES. "
40原 13:33 He spoke another parable to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three pecks of meal, until it was all leavened."
40原 13:34 All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable,
40原 13:35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HIDDEN SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD."
40原 13:36 Then He left the multitudes, and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
40原 13:37 And He answered and said, "The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
40原 13:38 and the field is the world; and [as for] the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one;]
40原 13:39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.
40原 13:40 "Therefore just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age.
40原 13:41 "The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness,
40原 13:42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40原 13:43 "Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
40原 13:44 "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
40原 13:45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,
40原 13:46 and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
40原 13:47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering [fish] of every kind;
40原 13:48 and when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good [fish] into containers, but the bad they threw away.
40原 13:49 "So it will be at the end of the age; the angels shall come forth, and take out the wicked from among the righteous,
40原 13:50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40原 13:51 "Have you understood all these things?" They *said to Him, "Yes."
40原 13:52 And He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a head of a household, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old."
40原 13:53 And it came about that when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
40原 13:54 And coming to His home town He [began] teaching them in their synagogue, so that they became astonished, and said, "Where [did] this man [ get] this wisdom, and [these] miraculous powers?
40原 13:55 "Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
40原 13:56 "And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then [did] this man [get] all these things?"
40原 13:57 And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his home town, and in his [own] household."
40原 13:58 And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
40原 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,
40原 14:2 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
40原 14:3 For when Herod had John arrested, he bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
40原 14:4 For John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
40原 14:5 And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet.
40原 14:6 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before [them] and pleased Herod.
40原 14:7 Thereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
40原 14:8 And having been prompted by her mother, she *said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
40原 14:9 And although he was grieved, the king commanded [it] to be given because of his oaths, and because of his dinner guests.
40原 14:10 And he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
40原 14:11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl; and she brought [it] to her mother.
40原 14:12 And his disciples came and took away the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.
40原 14:13 Now when Jesus heard [it,] He withdrew from there in a boat, to a lonely place by Himself; and when the multitudes heard [of this,] they followed Him on foot from the cities.
40原 14:14 And when He went ashore, He saw a great multitude, and felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.
40原 14:15 And when it was evening, the disciples came to Him, saying, "The place is desolate, and the time is already past; so send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
40原 14:16 But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away; you give them [something] to eat!"
40原 14:17 And they *said to Him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
40原 14:18 And He said, "Bring them here to Me."
40原 14:19 And ordering the multitudes to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed [the food,] and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave] to the multitudes,
40原 14:20 and they all ate, and were satisfied. And they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.
40原 14:21 And there were about five thousand men who ate, aside from women and children.
40原 14:22 And immediately He made the disciples get into the boat, and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.
40原 14:23 And after He had sent the multitudes away, He went up to the mountain by Himself to pray; and when it was evening, He was there alone.
40原 14:24 But the boat was already many stadia away from the land, battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
40原 14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.
40原 14:26 And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were frightened, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.
40原 14:27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid."
40原 14:28 And Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
40原 14:29 And He said, "Come!" And Peter got out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
40原 14:30 But seeing the wind, he became afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
40原 14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him, and *said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
40原 14:32 And when they got into the boat, the wind stopped.
40原 14:33 And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, "You are certainly God's Son!"
40原 14:34 And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
40原 14:35 And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent into all that surrounding district and brought to Him all who were sick;
40原 14:36 and they [began] to entreat Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched [it] were cured.
40原 15:1 Then some Pharisees and scribes *came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
40原 15:2 "Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."
40原 15:3 And He answered and said to them, "And why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
40原 15:4 "For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH.'
40原 15:5 "But you say, 'Whoever shall say to [his] father or mother," Anything of mine you might have been helped by has been given [to God,] "
40原 15:6 he is not to honor his father or his mother. 'And [thus] you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
40原 15:7 "You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
40原 15:8 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.
40原 15:9 'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.' "
40原 15:10 And after He called the multitude to Him, He said to them, "Hear, and understand.
40原 15:11 "Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
40原 15:12 Then the disciples *came and *said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
40原 15:13 But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up.
40原 15:14 "Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit."
40原 15:15 And Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain the parable to us."
40原 15:16 And He said, "Are you still lacking in understanding also?
40原 15:17 "Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?
40原 15:18 "But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.
40原 15:19 "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.
40原 15:20 "These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man."
40原 15:21 And Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.
40原 15:22 And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from that region, and [began] to cry out, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed."
40原 15:23 But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came to [Him] and kept asking Him, saying, "Send her away, for she is shouting out after us."
40原 15:24 But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40原 15:25 But she came and [began] to bow down before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
40原 15:26 And He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
40原 15:27 But she said, "Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
40原 15:28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, your faith is great; be it done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed at once.
40原 15:29 And departing from there, Jesus went along by the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up to the mountain, He was sitting there.
40原 15:30 And great multitudes came to Him, bringing with them [those who were] lame, crippled, blind, dumb, and many others, and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them,
40原 15:31 so that the multitude marveled as they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled restored, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
40原 15:32 And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, "I feel compassion for the multitude, because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not wish to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
40原 15:33 And the disciples *said to Him, "Where would we get so many loaves in a desolate place to satisfy such a great multitude?"
40原 15:34 And Jesus *said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
40原 15:35 And He directed the multitude to sit down on the ground;
40原 15:36 and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the disciples [in turn,] to the multitudes.
40原 15:37 And they all ate, and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets full.
40原 15:38 And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
40原 15:39 And sending away the multitudes, He got into the boat, and came to the region of Magadan.
40原 16:1 And the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
40原 16:2 But He answered and said to them, "When it is evening, you say, '[ It will be] fair weather, for the sky is red.'
40原 16:3 "And in the morning, ['There will be] a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot [discern] the signs of the times?
40原 16:4 "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah." And He left them, and went away.
40原 16:5 And the disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
40原 16:6 And Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40原 16:7 And they began to discuss among themselves, saying, "[It is] because we took no bread."
40原 16:8 But Jesus, aware of this, said, "You men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?
40原 16:9 "Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
40原 16:10 "Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many large baskets you took up?
40原 16:11 "How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40原 16:12 Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40原 16:13 Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He [ began] asking His disciples, saying, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
40原 16:14 And they said, "Some [say] John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
40原 16:15 He *said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
40原 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
40原 16:17 And Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal [this] to you, but My Father who is in heaven.
40原 16:18 "And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades shall not overpower it.
40原 16:19 "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
40原 16:20 Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.
40原 16:21 From that time Jesus Christ began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.
40原 16:22 And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid [it,] Lord! This shall never happen to You."
40原 16:23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
40原 16:24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
40原 16:25 "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake shall find it.
40原 16:26 "For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
40原 16:27 "For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and WILL THEN RECOMPENSE EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS.
40原 16:28 "Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
40原 17:1 And six days later Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and *brought them up to a high mountain by themselves.
40原 17:2 And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.
40原 17:3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
40原 17:4 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40原 17:5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!"
40原 17:6 And when the disciples heard [this,] they fell on their faces and were much afraid.
40原 17:7 And Jesus came to [them] and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
40原 17:8 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus Himself alone.
40原 17:9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
40原 17:10 And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
40原 17:11 And He answered and said, "Elijah is coming and will restore all things;
40原 17:12 but I say to you, that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands. "
40原 17:13 Then the disciples understood that He had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
40原 17:14 And when they came to the multitude, a man came up to Him, falling on his knees before Him, and saying,
40原 17:15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and is very ill; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
40原 17:16 "And I brought him to Your disciples, and they could not cure him."
40原 17:17 And Jesus answered and said, "O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to Me."
40原 17:18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured at once.
40原 17:19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
40原 17:20 And He *said to them, "Because of the littleness of your faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
40原 17:21 {"But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."}
40原 17:22 And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;
40原 17:23 and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day. "And they were deeply grieved.
40原 17:24 And when they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma [tax] came to Peter, and said, "Does your teacher not pay the two-drachma [tax]?"
40原 17:25 He *said, "Yes." And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from strangers?"
40原 17:26 And upon his saying, "From strangers," Jesus said to him, "Consequently the sons are exempt.
40原 17:27 "But, lest we give them offense, go to the sea, and throw in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a stater. Take that and give it to them for you and Me."
40原 18:1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40原 18:2 And He called a child to Himself and set him before them,
40原 18:3 and said, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
40原 18:4 "Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40原 18:5 "And whoever receives one such child in My name receives Me;
40原 18:6 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea.
40原 18:7 "Woe to the world because of [its] stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
40原 18:8 "And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire.
40原 18:9 "And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into the fiery hell.
40原 18:10 "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you, that their angels in heaven continually behold the face of My Father who is in heaven.
40原 18:11 {"For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.}
40原 18:12 "What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?
40原 18:13 "And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
40原 18:14 "Thus it is not [the] will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.
40原 18:15 "And if your brother sins, go and reprove him in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.
40原 18:16 "But if he does not listen [to you,] take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED.
40原 18:17 "And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax-gatherer.
40原 18:18 "Truly I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
40原 18:19 "Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.
40原 18:20 "For where two or three have gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst."
40原 18:21 Then Peter came and said to Him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
40原 18:22 Jesus *said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
40原 18:23 "For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a certain king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
40原 18:24 "And when he had begun to settle [them,] there was brought to him one who owed him ten thousand talents.
40原 18:25 "But since he did not have [the means] to repay, his lord commanded him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.
40原 18:26 "The slave therefore falling down, prostrated himself before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you everything.'
40原 18:27 "And the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the debt.
40原 18:28 "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and [began] to choke [him,] saying, 'Pay back what you owe.'
40原 18:29 "So his fellow slave fell down and [began] to entreat him, saying, ' Have patience with me and I will repay you. '
40原 18:30 "He was unwilling however, but went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed.
40原 18:31 "So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened.
40原 18:32 "Then summoning him, his lord *said to him, 'You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you entreated me.
40原 18:33 'Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, even as I had mercy on you?'
40原 18:34 "And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him.
40原 18:35 "So shall My heavenly Father also do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart."
40原 19:1 And it came about that when Jesus had finished these words, He departed from Galilee, and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan;
40原 19:2 and great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.
40原 19:3 And [some] Pharisees came to Him, testing Him, and saying, "Is it lawful [for a man] to divorce his wife for any cause at all?"
40原 19:4 And He answered and said, "Have you not read, that He who created [ them] from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,
40原 19:5 and said, 'FOR THIS CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE; AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?
40原 19:6 "Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
40原 19:7 They *said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to GIVE HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND [her] AWAY?"
40原 19:8 He *said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.
40原 19:9 "And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."
40原 19:10 The disciples *said to Him, "If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry."
40原 19:11 But He said to them, "Not all men [can] accept this statement, but [only] those to whom it has been given.
40原 19:12 "For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are [also] eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept [this,] let him accept [it."]
40原 19:13 Then [some] children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
40原 19:14 But Jesus said, "Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
40原 19:15 And after laying His hands on them, He departed from there.
40原 19:16 And behold, one came to Him and said, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?"
40原 19:17 And He said to him, "Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is [only] One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."
40原 19:18 He *said to Him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS;
40原 19:19 HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF. "
40原 19:20 The young man *said to Him, "All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?"
40原 19:21 Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go [and] sell your possessions and give to [the] poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
40原 19:22 But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieved; for he was one who owned much property.
40原 19:23 And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
40原 19:24 "And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
40原 19:25 And when the disciples heard [this,] they were very astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
40原 19:26 And looking upon [them] Jesus said to them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40原 19:27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?"
40原 19:28 And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
40原 19:29 "And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name's sake, shall receive many times as much, and shall inherit eternal life.
40原 19:30 "But many [who are] first will be last; and [the] last, first.
40原 20:1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
40原 20:2 "And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
40原 20:3 "And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place;
40原 20:4 and to those he said, 'You too go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' And [so] they went.
40原 20:5 "Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.
40原 20:6 "And about the eleventh [hour] he went out, and found others standing; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?'
40原 20:7 "They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You too go into the vineyard.'
40原 20:8 "And when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last [group] to the first.'
40原 20:9 "And when those [hired] about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.
40原 20:10 "And when those [hired] first came, they thought that they would receive more; and they also received each one a denarius.
40原 20:11 "And when they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,
40原 20:12 saying, 'These last men have worked [only] one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.'
40原 20:13 "But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?
40原 20:14 'Take what is yours and go your way, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
40原 20:15 'Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?'
40原 20:16 "Thus the last shall be first, and the first last."
40原 20:17 And as Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve [disciples] aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,
40原 20:18 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,
40原 20:19 and will deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify [Him,] and on the third day He will be raised up. "
40原 20:20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, bowing down, and making a request of Him.
40原 20:21 And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She *said to Him, "Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left."
40原 20:22 But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They *said to Him, "We are able."
40原 20:23 He *said to them, "My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on [My] left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."
40原 20:24 And hearing [this,] the ten became indignant with the two brothers.
40原 20:25 But Jesus called them to Himself, and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and [their] great men exercise authority over them.
40原 20:26 "It is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant,
40原 20:27 and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave;
40原 20:28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many. "
40原 20:29 And as they were going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
40原 20:30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40原 20:31 And the multitude sternly told them to be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40原 20:32 And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
40原 20:33 They *said to Him, "Lord, [we want] our eyes to be opened."
40原 20:34 And moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
40原 21:1 And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
40原 21:2 saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied [there] and a colt with her; untie [them,] and bring [them] to Me.
40原 21:3 "And if anyone says something to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them."
40原 21:4 Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
40原 21:5 "SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'"
40原 21:6 And the disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them,
40原 21:7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them their garments, on which He sat.
40原 21:8 And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and spreading them in the road.
40原 21:9 And the multitudes going before Him, and those who followed after were crying out, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!"
40原 21:10 And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"
40原 21:11 And the multitudes were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee."
40原 21:12 And Jesus entered the temple and cast out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
40原 21:13 And He *said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a Robbers' DEN."
40原 21:14 And [the] blind and [the] lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
40原 21:15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became indignant,
40原 21:16 and said to Him, "Do You hear what these are saying?" And Jesus *said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'OUT OF THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABES THOU HAST PREPARED PRAISE FOR THYSELF'?"
40原 21:17 And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
40原 21:18 Now in the morning, when He returned to the city, He became hungry.
40原 21:19 And seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it, and found nothing on it except leaves only; and He *said to it, "No longer shall there ever be [any] fruit from you." And at once the fig tree withered.
40原 21:20 And seeing [this,] the disciples marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither at once?"
40原 21:21 And Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith, and do not doubt, you shall not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it shall happen.
40原 21:22 "And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive."
40原 21:23 And when He had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?"
40原 21:24 And Jesus answered and said to them, "I will ask you one thing too, which if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
40原 21:25 "The baptism of John was from what [source,] from heaven or from men?" And they [began] reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'
40原 21:26 "But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the multitude; for they all hold John to be a prophet."
40原 21:27 And answering Jesus, they said, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
40原 21:28 "But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'
40原 21:29 "And he answered and said, 'I will, sir'; and he did not go.
40原 21:30 "And he came to the second and said the same thing. But he answered and said, 'I will not'; [yet] he afterward regretted [it] and went.
40原 21:31 "Which of the two did the will of his father?" They *said, "The latter." Jesus *said to them, "Truly I say to you that the tax-gatherers and harlots will get into the kingdom of God before you.
40原 21:32 "For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him; but the tax-gatherers and harlots did believe him; and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.
40原 21:33 "Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT AND DUG A WINE PRESS IN IT, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey.
40原 21:34 "And when the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his produce.
40原 21:35 "And the vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned a third.
40原 21:36 "Again he sent another group of slaves larger than the first; and they did the same thing to them.
40原 21:37 "But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
40原 21:38 "But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize his inheritance.'
40原 21:39 "And they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
40原 21:40 "Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?"
40原 21:41 They *said to Him, "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers, who will pay him the proceeds at the [proper] seasons."
40原 21:42 Jesus *said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, ' THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER [stone;] THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'?
40原 21:43 "Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and be given to a nation producing the fruit of it.
40原 21:44 "And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust."
40原 21:45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
40原 21:46 And when they sought to seize Him, they feared the multitudes, because they held Him to be a prophet.
40原 22:1 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,
40原 22:2 "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king, who gave a wedding feast for his son.
40原 22:3 "And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.
40原 22:4 "Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited," Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are [all] butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast. "'
40原 22:5 "But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,
40原 22:6 and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.
40原 22:7 "But the king was enraged and sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and set their city on fire.
40原 22:8 "Then he *said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
40原 22:9 'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find [there,] invite to the wedding feast.'
40原 22:10 "And those slaves went out into the streets, and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.
40原 22:11 "But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw there a man not dressed in wedding clothes,
40原 22:12 and he *said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And he was speechless.
40原 22:13 "Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40原 22:14 "For many are called, but few [are] chosen."
40原 22:15 Then the Pharisees went and counseled together how they might trap Him in what He said.
40原 22:16 And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.
40原 22:17 "Tell us therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?"
40原 22:18 But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, "Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?
40原 22:19 "Show Me the coin [used] for the poll-tax." And they brought Him a denarius.
40原 22:20 And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"
40原 22:21 They *said to Him, "Caesar's." Then He *said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."
40原 22:22 And hearing [this,] they marveled, and leaving Him, they went away.
40原 22:23 On that day [some] Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Him and questioned Him,
40原 22:24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES, HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP AN OFFSPRING TO HIS BROTHER.'
40原 22:25 "Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother;
40原 22:26 so also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.
40原 22:27 "And last of all, the woman died.
40原 22:28 "In the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? For they all had her."
40原 22:29 But Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures, or the power of God.
40原 22:30 "For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
40原 22:31 "But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
40原 22:32 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living. "
40原 22:33 And when the multitudes heard [this,] they were astonished at His teaching.
40原 22:34 But when the Pharisees heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence, they gathered themselves together.
40原 22:35 And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him [a question,] testing Him,
40原 22:36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"
40原 22:37 And He said to him, "'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'
40原 22:38 "This is the great and foremost commandment.
40原 22:39 "The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'
40原 22:40 "On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets."
40原 22:41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
40原 22:42 saying, "What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?" They *said to Him, "[The son] of David."
40原 22:43 He *said to them, "Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying,
40原 22:44 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT THINE ENEMIES BENEATH THY FEET"'?
40原 22:45 "If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?"
40原 22:46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.
40原 23:1 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples,
40原 23:2 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;
40原 23:3 therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say [things,] and do not do [them.]
40原 23:4 "And they tie up heavy loads, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves are unwilling to move them with [so much as] a finger.
40原 23:5 "But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries, and lengthen the tassels [of their garments.]
40原 23:6 "And they love the place of honor at banquets, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
40原 23:7 and respectful greetings in the market places, and being called by men, Rabbi.
40原 23:8 "But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
40原 23:9 "And do not call [anyone] on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
40原 23:10 "And do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, [that is,] Christ.
40原 23:11 "But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
40原 23:12 "And whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
40原 23:13 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
40原 23:14 {"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you shall receive greater condemnation.}
40原 23:15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
40原 23:16 "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'
40原 23:17 "You fools and blind men; which is more important, the gold, or the temple that sanctified the gold?
40原 23:18 "And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, [that] is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering upon it, he is obligated.'
40原 23:19 "You blind men, which is more important, the offering or the altar that sanctifies the offering?
40原 23:20 "Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears [both] by the altar and by everything on it.
40原 23:21 "And he who swears by the temple, swears [both] by the temple and by Him who dwells within it.
40原 23:22 "And he who swears by heaven, swears [both] by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
40原 23:23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
40原 23:24 "You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
40原 23:25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.
40原 23:26 "You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.
40原 23:27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
40原 23:28 "Even so you too outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
40原 23:29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
40原 23:30 and say, 'If we had been [living] in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in [shedding] the blood of the prophets.'
40原 23:31 "Consequently you bear witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
40原 23:32 "Fill up then the measure [of the guilt] of your fathers.
40原 23:33 "You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell?
40原 23:34 "Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city,
40原 23:35 that upon you may fall [the guilt of] all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40原 23:36 "Truly I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
40原 23:37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.
40原 23:38 "Behold, your house is being left to you desolate!
40原 23:39 "For I say to you, from now on you shall not see Me until you say, ' BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD! '"
40原 24:1 And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him.
40原 24:2 And He answered and said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here shall be left upon another, which will not be torn down."
40原 24:3 And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what [will be] the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
40原 24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you.
40原 24:5 "For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.
40原 24:6 "And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not frightened, for [those things] must take place, but [that] is not yet the end.
40原 24:7 "For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.
40原 24:8 "But all these things are [merely] the beginning of birth pangs.
40原 24:9 "Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name.
40原 24:10 "And at that time many will fall away and will deliver up one another and hate one another.
40原 24:11 "And many false prophets will arise, and will mislead many.
40原 24:12 "And because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will grow cold.
40原 24:13 "But the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved.
40原 24:14 "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a witness to all the nations, and then the end shall come.
40原 24:15 "Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
40原 24:16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains;
40原 24:17 let him who is on the housetop not go down to get the things out that are in his house;
40原 24:18 and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak.
40原 24:19 "But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days!
40原 24:20 "But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath;
40原 24:21 for then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall.
40原 24:22 "And unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days shall be cut short.
40原 24:23 "Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or 'There [He is,'] do not believe [him.]
40原 24:24 "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
40原 24:25 "Behold, I have told you in advance.
40原 24:26 "If therefore they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go forth, [or,]' Behold, He is in the inner rooms, 'do not believe [them.]
40原 24:27 "For just as the lightning comes from the east, and flashes even to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.
40原 24:28 "Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
40原 24:29 "But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken,
40原 24:30 and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.
40原 24:31 "And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
40原 24:32 "Now learn the parable from the fig tree when its branch has already become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;
40原 24:33 even so you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, [right] at the door.
40原 24:34 "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
40原 24:35 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall not pass away.
40原 24:36 "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
40原 24:37 "For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.
40原 24:38 "For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, they were marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,
40原 24:39 and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.
40原 24:40 "Then there shall be two men in the field; one will be taken, and one will be left.
40原 24:41 "Two women [will be] grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and one will be left.
40原 24:42 "Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.
40原 24:43 "But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
40原 24:44 "For this reason you be ready too; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think [He will.]
40原 24:45 "Who then is the faithful and sensible slave whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time?
40原 24:46 "Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
40原 24:47 "Truly I say to you, that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40原 24:48 "But if that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is not coming for a long time,'
40原 24:49 and shall begin to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with drunkards;
40原 24:50 the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect [him] and at an hour which he does not know,
40原 24:51 and shall cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; weeping shall be there and the gnashing of teeth.
40原 25:1 "Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.
40原 25:2 "And five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.
40原 25:3 "For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,
40原 25:4 but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their lamps.
40原 25:5 "Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and [began] to sleep.
40原 25:6 "But at midnight there was a shout, 'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet [him.']
40原 25:7 "Then all those virgins rose, and trimmed their lamps.
40原 25:8 "And the foolish said to the prudent, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
40原 25:9 "But the prudent answered, saying, 'No, there will not be enough for us and you [too;] go instead to the dealers and buy [some] for yourselves.'
40原 25:10 "And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
40原 25:11 "And later the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, lord, open up for us.'
40原 25:12 "But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
40原 25:13 "Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour.
40原 25:14 "For [it is] just like a man [about] to go on a journey, who called his own slaves, and entrusted his possessions to them.
40原 25:15 "And to one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.
40原 25:16 "Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
40原 25:17 "In the same manner the one who [had received] the two [talents] gained two more.
40原 25:18 "But he who received the one [talent] went away and dug in the ground, and hid his master's money.
40原 25:19 "Now after a long time the master of those slaves *came and *settled accounts with them.
40原 25:20 "And the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me; see, I have gained five more talents.'
40原 25:21 "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things, enter into the joy of your master.'
40原 25:22 "The one also who [had received] the two talents came up and said, ' Master, you entrusted to me two talents; see, I have gained two more talents. '
40原 25:23 "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.'
40原 25:24 "And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no [seed.]
40原 25:25 'And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground; see, you have what is yours.'
40原 25:26 "But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I scattered no [seed.]
40原 25:27 'Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my [money] back with interest.
40原 25:28 'Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.'
40原 25:29 "For to everyone who has shall [more] be given, and he shall have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.
40原 25:30 "And cast out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40原 25:31 "But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
40原 25:32 "And all the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;
40原 25:33 and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.
40原 25:34 "Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
40原 25:35 'For I was hungry, and you gave Me [something] to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in;
40原 25:36 naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me. '
40原 25:37 "Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You drink?
40原 25:38 'And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You?
40原 25:39 'And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'
40原 25:40 "And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, [even] the least [of them,] you did it to Me.'
40原 25:41 "Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;
40原 25:42 for I was hungry, and you gave Me [nothing] to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;
40原 25:43 I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me. '
40原 25:44 "Then they themselves also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?'
40原 25:45 "Then He will answer them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.'
40原 25:46 "And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
40原 26:1 And it came about that when Jesus had finished all these words, He said to His disciples,
40原 26:2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is [to be] delivered up for crucifixion."
40原 26:3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;
40原 26:4 and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth, and kill [Him.]
40原 26:5 But they were saying, "Not during the festival, lest a riot occur among the people."
40原 26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper,
40原 26:7 a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she poured it upon His head as He reclined [at the table.]
40原 26:8 But the disciples were indignant when they saw [this,] and said, "Why this waste?
40原 26:9 "For this [perfume] might have been sold for a high price and [the money] given to the poor."
40原 26:10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you bother the woman? For she has done a good deed to Me.
40原 26:11 "For the poor you have with you always; but you do not always have Me.
40原 26:12 "For when she poured this perfume upon My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.
40原 26:13 "Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be spoken of in memory of her."
40原 26:14 Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
40原 26:15 and said, "What are you willing to give me to deliver Him up to you?" And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.
40原 26:16 And from then on he [began] looking for a good opportunity to betray Him.
40原 26:17 Now on the first [day] of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
40原 26:18 And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ' The Teacher says," My time is at hand; I [am to] keep the Passover at your house with My disciples. "'"
40原 26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
40原 26:20 Now when evening had come, He was reclining [at the table] with the twelve disciples.
40原 26:21 And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me."
40原 26:22 And being deeply grieved, they each one began to say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
40原 26:23 And He answered and said, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.
40原 26:24 "The Son of Man [is to] go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
40原 26:25 And Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, "Surely it is not I, Rabbi?" He *said to him, "You have said [it] yourself."
40原 26:26 And while they were eating, Jesus took [some] bread, and after a blessing, He broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
40原 26:27 And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
40原 26:28 for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.
40原 26:29 "But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."
40原 26:30 And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40原 26:31 Then Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.'
40原 26:32 "But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."
40原 26:33 But Peter answered and said to Him, ["Even] though all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away."
40原 26:34 Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this [very] night, before a cock crows, you shall deny Me three times."
40原 26:35 Peter *said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You." All the disciples said the same thing too.
40原 26:36 Then Jesus *came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and *said to His disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
40原 26:37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed.
40原 26:38 Then He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me."
40原 26:39 And He went a little beyond [them,] and fell on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as Thou wilt."
40原 26:40 And He *came to the disciples and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "So, you [men] could not keep watch with Me for one hour?
40原 26:41 "Keep watching and praying, that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
40原 26:42 He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Thy will be done."
40原 26:43 And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
40原 26:44 And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.
40原 26:45 Then He *came to the disciples, and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40原 26:46 "Arise, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!"
40原 26:47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up, accompanied by a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
40原 26:48 Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one; seize Him."
40原 26:49 And immediately he went to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
40原 26:50 And Jesus said to him, "Friend, [do] what you have come for." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
40原 26:51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
40原 26:52 Then Jesus *said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.
40原 26:53 "Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
40原 26:54 "How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?"
40原 26:55 At that time Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as against a robber? Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.
40原 26:56 "But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
40原 26:57 And those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
40原 26:58 But Peter also was following Him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and entered in, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
40原 26:59 Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, in order that they might put Him to death;
40原 26:60 and they did not find [any,] even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward,
40原 26:61 and said, "This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'"
40原 26:62 And the high priest stood up and said to Him, "Do You make no answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
40原 26:63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God."
40原 26:64 Jesus *said to him, "You have said it [yourself]; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN."
40原 26:65 Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy;
40原 26:66 what do you think? "They answered and said," He is deserving of death! "
40原 26:67 Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others slapped Him,
40原 26:68 and said, "Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?"
40原 26:69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a certain servant-girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean."
40原 26:70 But he denied [it] before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
40原 26:71 And when he had gone out to the gateway, another [servant-girl] saw him and *said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
40原 26:72 And again he denied [it] with an oath, "I do not know the man."
40原 26:73 And a little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are [one] of them; for the way you talk gives you away."
40原 26:74 Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a cock crowed.
40原 26:75 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, "Before a cock crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
40原 27:1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death;
40原 27:2 and they bound Him, and led Him away, and delivered Him up to Pilate the governor.
40原 27:3 Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
40原 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, " What is that to us? See [to that] yourself! "
40原 27:5 And he threw the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
40原 27:6 And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood."
40原 27:7 And they counseled together and with the money bought the Potter's Field as a burial place for strangers.
40原 27:8 For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
40原 27:9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, "AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;
40原 27:10 AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE Potter's FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME. "
40原 27:11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And Jesus said to him, "[It is as] you say."
40原 27:12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He made no answer.
40原 27:13 Then Pilate *said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"
40原 27:14 And He did not answer him with regard to even a [single] charge, so that the governor was quite amazed.
40原 27:15 Now at [the] feast the governor was accustomed to release for the multitude [any] one prisoner whom they wanted.
40原 27:16 And they were holding at that time a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
40原 27:17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, " Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ? "
40原 27:18 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered Him up.
40原 27:19 And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."
40原 27:20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and to put Jesus to death.
40原 27:21 But the governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
40原 27:22 Pilate *said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all *said, "Let Him be crucified!"
40原 27:23 And he said, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"
40原 27:24 And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of this Man's blood; see [to that] yourselves."
40原 27:25 And all the people answered and said, "His blood [be] on us and on our children!"
40原 27:26 Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged, he delivered Him to be crucified.
40原 27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole [Roman] cohort around Him.
40原 27:28 And they stripped Him, and put a scarlet robe on Him.
40原 27:29 And after weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled down before Him and mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
40原 27:30 And they spat on Him, and took the reed and [began] to beat Him on the head.
40原 27:31 And after they had mocked Him, they took His robe off and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify [Him.]
40原 27:32 And as they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.
40原 27:33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull,
40原 27:34 they gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall; and after tasting [ it,] He was unwilling to drink.
40原 27:35 And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots;
40原 27:36 and sitting down, they [began] to keep watch over Him there.
40原 27:37 And they put up above His head the charge against Him which read, " THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. "
40原 27:38 At that time two robbers *were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
40原 27:39 And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads,
40原 27:40 and saying, "You who [are going to] destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40原 27:41 In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking [Him,] and saying,
40原 27:42 "He saved others; He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down from the cross, and we shall believe in Him.
40原 27:43 "HE TRUSTS IN GOD; LET HIM DELIVER [Him] now, IF HE TAKES PLEASURE IN HIM; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
40原 27:44 And the robbers also who had been crucified with Him were casting the same insult at Him.
40原 27:45 Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
40原 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?"
40原 27:47 And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, [began] saying, "This man is calling for Elijah."
40原 27:48 And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.
40原 27:49 But the rest [of them] said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him."
40原 27:50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up [His] spirit.
40原 27:51 And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook; and the rocks were split,
40原 27:52 and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
40原 27:53 and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
40原 27:54 Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very frightened and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
40原 27:55 And many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,
40原 27:56 among whom was Mary Magdalene, [along with] Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
40原 27:57 And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
40原 27:58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered [it] to be given over [to him.]
40原 27:59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
40原 27:60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.
40原 27:61 And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
40原 27:62 Now on the next day, which is [the one] after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,
40原 27:63 and said, "Sir, we remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I [am to] rise again.'
40原 27:64 "Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, lest the disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people, ' He has risen from the dead, 'and the last deception will be worse than the first."
40原 27:65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make it [as] secure as you know how."
40原 27:66 And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the stone.
40原 28:1 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
40原 28:2 And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
40原 28:3 And his appearance was like lightning, and his garment as white as snow;
40原 28:4 and the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.
40原 28:5 And the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Jesus who has been crucified.
40原 28:6 "He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.
40原 28:7 "And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going before you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you."
40原 28:8 And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.
40原 28:9 And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.
40原 28:10 Then Jesus *said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they shall see Me."
40原 28:11 Now while they were on their way, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
40原 28:12 And when they had assembled with the elders and counseled together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
40原 28:13 and said, "You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'
40原 28:14 "And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble."
40原 28:15 And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, [and is] to this day.
40原 28:16 But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
40原 28:17 And when they saw Him, they worshiped [Him]; but some were doubtful.
40原 28:18 And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
40原 28:19 "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
40原 28:20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. "
41
41厳 1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
41厳 1:2 As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY;
41厳 1:3 THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.' "
41厳 1:4 John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41厳 1:5 And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
41厳 1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair and [wore] a leather belt around his waist, and his diet was locusts and wild honey.
41厳 1:7 And he was preaching, and saying, "After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thong of His sandals.
41厳 1:8 "I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41厳 1:9 And it came about in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41厳 1:10 And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him;
41厳 1:11 and a voice came out of the heavens "Thou art My beloved Son, in Thee I am well-pleased."
41厳 1:12 And immediately the Spirit *impelled Him [to go] out into the wilderness.
41厳 1:13 And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.
41厳 1:14 And after John had been taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
41厳 1:15 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."
41厳 1:16 And as He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.
41厳 1:17 And Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men."
41厳 1:18 And they immediately left the nets and followed Him.
41厳 1:19 And going on a little farther, He saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
41厳 1:20 And immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him.
41厳 1:21 And they *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and [began] to teach.
41厳 1:22 And they were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as [ one] having authority, and not as the scribes.
41厳 1:23 And just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
41厳 1:24 saying, "What do we have to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-- the Holy One of God!"
41厳 1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
41厳 1:26 And throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.
41厳 1:27 And they were all amazed, so that they debated among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
41厳 1:28 And immediately the news about Him went out everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
41厳 1:29 And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
41厳 1:30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Him about her.
41厳 1:31 And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she waited on them.
41厳 1:32 And when evening had come, after the sun had set, they [began] bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.
41厳 1:33 And the whole city had gathered at the door.
41厳 1:34 And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.
41厳 1:35 And in the early morning, while it was still dark, He arose and went out and departed to a lonely place, and was praying there.
41厳 1:36 And Simon and his companions hunted for Him;
41厳 1:37 and they found Him, and *said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You."
41厳 1:38 And He *said to them, "Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby, in order that I may preach there also; for that is what I came out for."
41厳 1:39 And He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out the demons.
41厳 1:40 And a leper *came to Him, beseeching Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
41厳 1:41 And moved with compassion, He stretched out His hand, and touched him, and *said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed."
41厳 1:42 And immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
41厳 1:43 And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,
41厳 1:44 and He *said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
41厳 1:45 But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news about, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.
41厳 2:1 And when He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home.
41厳 2:2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them.
41厳 2:3 And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men.
41厳 2:4 And being unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
41厳 2:5 And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
41厳 2:6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
41厳 2:7 "Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41厳 2:8 And immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, "Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
41厳 2:9 "Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven'; or to say,' Arise, and take up your pallet and walk '?
41厳 2:10 "But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-- He *said to the paralytic--
41厳 2:11 "I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home."
41厳 2:12 And he rose and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of all; so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, " We have never seen anything like this. "
41厳 2:13 And He went out again by the seashore; and all the multitude were coming to Him, and He was teaching them.
41厳 2:14 And as He passed by, He saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting in the tax office, and He *said to him, "Follow Me!" And he rose and followed Him.
41厳 2:15 And it came about that He was reclining [at the table] in his house, and many tax-gatherers and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many of them, and they were following Him.
41厳 2:16 And when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax-gatherers, they [began] saying to His disciples, "Why is He eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners?"
41厳 2:17 And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, "[It is] not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
41厳 2:18 And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
41厳 2:19 And Jesus said to them, "While the bridegroom is with them, the attendants of the bridegroom do not fast, do they? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
41厳 2:20 "But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
41厳 2:21 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results.
41厳 2:22 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins [as well;] but [one puts] new wine into fresh wineskins."
41厳 2:23 And it came about that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads [of grain.]
41厳 2:24 And the Pharisees were saying to Him, "See here, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
41厳 2:25 And He *said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and became hungry, he and his companions
41厳 2:26 how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for [anyone] to eat except the priests, and he gave [it] also to those who were with him? "
41厳 2:27 And He was saying to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
41厳 2:28 "Consequently, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
41厳 3:1 And He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there with a withered hand.
41厳 3:2 And they were watching Him [to see] if He would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they might accuse Him.
41厳 3:3 And He *said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise and [come] forward!"
41厳 3:4 And He *said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent.
41厳 3:5 And after looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
41厳 3:6 And the Pharisees went out and immediately [began] taking counsel with the Herodians against Him, [as to] how they might destroy Him.
41厳 3:7 And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and [also] from Judea,
41厳 3:8 and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude heard of all that He was doing and came to Him.
41厳 3:9 And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the multitude, in order that they might not crowd Him;
41厳 3:10 for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed about Him in order to touch Him.
41厳 3:11 And whenever the unclean spirits beheld Him, they would fall down before Him and cry out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
41厳 3:12 And He earnestly warned them not to make Him known.
41厳 3:13 And He *went up to the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him.
41厳 3:14 And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and that He might send them out to preach,
41厳 3:15 and to have authority to cast out the demons.
41厳 3:16 And He appointed the twelve Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),
41厳 3:17 and James, the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, "Sons of Thunder");
41厳 3:18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;
41厳 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
41厳 3:20 And He *came home, and the multitude *gathered again, to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.
41厳 3:21 And when His own people heard [of this,] they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, "He has lost His senses."
41厳 3:22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," and "He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons."
41厳 3:23 And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
41厳 3:24 "And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41厳 3:25 "And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
41厳 3:26 "And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!
41厳 3:27 "But no one can enter the strong man's house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.
41厳 3:28 "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;
41厳 3:29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin "--
41厳 3:30 because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
41厳 3:31 And His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent [word] to Him, and called Him.
41厳 3:32 And a multitude was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, "Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You."
41厳 3:33 And answering them, He *said, "Who are My mother and My brothers?"
41厳 3:34 And looking about on those who were sitting around Him, He *said, " Behold, My mother and My brothers!
41厳 3:35 "For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother."
41厳 4:1 And He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very great multitude gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
41厳 4:2 And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching,
41厳 4:3 "Listen [to this]! Behold, the sower went out to sow;
41厳 4:4 and it came about that as he was sowing, some [seed] fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.
41厳 4:5 "And other [seed] fell on the rocky [ground] where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
41厳 4:6 "And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
41厳 4:7 "And other [seed] fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.
41厳 4:8 "And other [seeds] fell into the good soil and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
41厳 4:9 And He was saying, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
41厳 4:10 And as soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, [began] asking Him [about] the parables.
41厳 4:11 And He was saying to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God; but those who are outside get everything in parables,
41厳 4:12 in order that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE; AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND LEST THEY RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN. "
41厳 4:13 And He *said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables?
41厳 4:14 "The sower sows the word.
41厳 4:15 "And these are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
41厳 4:16 "And in a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky [places,] who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;
41厳 4:17 and they have no [firm] root in themselves, but are [only] temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away.
41厳 4:18 "And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,
41厳 4:19 and the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
41厳 4:20 "And those are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept it, and bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
41厳 4:21 And He was saying to them, "A lamp is not brought to be put under a peck-measure, is it, or under a bed? Is it not [brought] to be put on the lampstand?
41厳 4:22 "For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has [anything] been secret, but that it should come to light.
41厳 4:23 "If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
41厳 4:24 And He was saying to them, "Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it shall be measured to you; and more shall be given you besides.
41厳 4:25 "For whoever has, to him shall [more] be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him."
41厳 4:26 And He was saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil;
41厳 4:27 and goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts up and grows-- how, he himself does not know.
41厳 4:28 "The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head.
41厳 4:29 "But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."
41厳 4:30 And He said, "How shall we picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?
41厳 4:31 "[It is] like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon the soil,
41厳 4:32 yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE ."
41厳 4:33 And with many such parables He was speaking the word to them as they were able to hear it;
41厳 4:34 and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.
41厳 4:35 And on that day, when evening had come, He *said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."
41厳 4:36 And leaving the multitude, they *took Him along with them, just as He was, in the boat; and other boats were with Him.
41厳 4:37 And there *arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up.
41厳 4:38 And He Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they *awoke Him and *said to Him, "Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?"
41厳 4:39 And being aroused, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.
41厳 4:40 And He said to them, "Why are you so timid? How is it that you have no faith?"
41厳 4:41 And they became very much afraid and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?"
41厳 5:1 And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
41厳 5:2 And when He had come out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him,
41厳 5:3 and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain;
41厳 5:4 because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
41厳 5:5 And constantly night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and gashing himself with stones.
41厳 5:6 And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him;
41厳 5:7 and crying out with a loud voice, he *said, "What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!"
41厳 5:8 For He had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
41厳 5:9 And He was asking him, "What is your name?" And he *said to Him, "My name is Legion; for we are many."
41厳 5:10 And he [began] to entreat Him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
41厳 5:11 Now there was a big herd of swine feeding there on the mountain.
41厳 5:12 And [the demons] entreated Him, saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter them."
41厳 5:13 And He gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand [of them]; and they were drowned in the sea.
41厳 5:14 And their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and [out] in the country. And [the people] came to see what it was that had happened.
41厳 5:15 And they *came to Jesus and *observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the "legion"; and they became frightened.
41厳 5:16 And those who had seen it described to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man, and [all] about the swine.
41厳 5:17 And they began to entreat Him to depart from their region.
41厳 5:18 And as He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was entreating Him that he might accompany Him.
41厳 5:19 And He did not let him, but He *said to him, "Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and [ how] He had mercy on you."
41厳 5:20 And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone marveled.
41厳 5:21 And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered about Him; and He stayed by the seashore.
41厳 5:22 And one of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and upon seeing Him, *fell at His feet,
41厳 5:23 and *entreated Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death; [please] come and lay Your hands on her, that she may get well and live."
41厳 5:24 And He went off with him; and a great multitude was following Him and pressing in on Him.
41厳 5:25 And a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,
41厳 5:26 and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse,
41厳 5:27 after hearing about Jesus, came up in the crowd behind [Him,] and touched His cloak.
41厳 5:28 For she thought, "If I just touch His garments, I shall get well."
41厳 5:29 And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
41厳 5:30 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power [proceeding] from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and said, " Who touched My garments? "
41厳 5:31 And His disciples said to Him, "You see the multitude pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'"
41厳 5:32 And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.
41厳 5:33 But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him, and told Him the whole truth.
41厳 5:34 And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your affliction."
41厳 5:35 While He was still speaking, they *came from the [house of] the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?"
41厳 5:36 But Jesus, overhearing what was being spoken, *said to the synagogue official, "Do not be afraid [any longer,] only believe."
41厳 5:37 And He allowed no one to follow with Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
41厳 5:38 And they *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *beheld a commotion, and [people] loudly weeping and wailing.
41厳 5:39 And entering in, He *said to them, "Why make a commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is asleep."
41厳 5:40 And they [began] laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took along the child's father and mother and His own companions, and *entered [the room] where the child was.
41厳 5:41 And taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, "Talitha kum!" (which translated means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise!").
41厳 5:42 And immediately the girl rose and [began] to walk; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded.
41厳 5:43 And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this; and He said that [something] should be given her to eat.
41厳 6:1 And He went out from there, and He *came into His home town; and His disciples *followed Him.
41厳 6:2 And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, "Where did this man [get] these things, and what is [this] wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?
41厳 6:3 "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?" And they took offense at Him.
41厳 6:4 And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his home town and among his [own] relatives and in his [own] household."
41厳 6:5 And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands upon a few sick people and healed them.
41厳 6:6 And He wondered at their unbelief. And He was going around the villages teaching.
41厳 6:7 And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs; and He was giving them authority over the unclean spirits;
41厳 6:8 and He instructed them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, except a mere staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belt;
41厳 6:9 but [to] wear sandals; and [He added], "Do not put on two tunics."
41厳 6:10 And He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town.
41厳 6:11 "And any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust from the soles of your feet for a testimony against them."
41厳 6:12 And they went out and preached that [men] should repent.
41厳 6:13 And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.
41厳 6:14 And King Herod heard [of it,] for His name had become well known; and [people] were saying, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him."
41厳 6:15 But others were saying, "He is Elijah." And others were saying, "[ He is] a prophet, like one of the prophets [of old."]
41厳 6:16 But when Herod heard [of it,] he kept saying, "John, whom I beheaded, has risen!"
41厳 6:17 For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her.
41厳 6:18 For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41厳 6:19 And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death and could not [do so;]
41厳 6:20 for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him.
41厳 6:21 And a strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his lords and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee;
41厳 6:22 and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you."
41厳 6:23 And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom."
41厳 6:24 And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist."
41厳 6:25 And immediately she came in haste before the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me right away the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
41厳 6:26 And although the king was very sorry, [yet] because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he was unwilling to refuse her.
41厳 6:27 And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded [him] to bring [back] his head. And he went and had him beheaded in the prison,
41厳 6:28 and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
41厳 6:29 And when his disciples heard [about this,] they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.
41厳 6:30 And the apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught.
41厳 6:31 And He *said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while." (For there were many [people] coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)
41厳 6:32 And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.
41厳 6:33 And [the people] saw them going, and many recognized [them,] and they ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them.
41厳 6:34 And when He went ashore, He saw a great multitude, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.
41厳 6:35 And when it was already quite late, His disciples came up to Him and [began] saying, "The place is desolate and it is already quite late;
41厳 6:36 send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. "
41厳 6:37 But He answered and said to them, "You give them [something] to eat!" And they *said to Him, "Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them [something] to eat?"
41厳 6:38 And He *said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go look!" And when they found out, they *said, "Five and two fish."
41厳 6:39 And He commanded them all to recline by groups on the green grass.
41厳 6:40 And they reclined in companies of hundreds and of fifties.
41厳 6:41 And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed [the food] and broke the loaves and He kept giving [them] to the disciples to set before them; and He divided up the two fish among them all.
41厳 6:42 And they all ate and were satisfied.
41厳 6:43 And they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish.
41厳 6:44 And there were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
41厳 6:45 And immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of [Him] to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the multitude away.
41厳 6:46 And after bidding them farewell, He departed to the mountain to pray.
41厳 6:47 And when it was evening, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and He [was] alone on the land.
41厳 6:48 And seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night, He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He intended to pass by them.
41厳 6:49 But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
41厳 6:50 for they all saw Him and were frightened. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, "Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid."
41厳 6:51 And He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were greatly astonished,
41厳 6:52 for they had not gained any insight from the [incident of] the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
41厳 6:53 And when they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
41厳 6:54 And when they had come out of the boat, immediately [the people] recognized Him,
41厳 6:55 and ran about that whole country and began to carry about on their pallets those who were sick, to the place they heard He was.
41厳 6:56 And wherever He entered villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the market places, and entreating Him that they might just touch the fringe of His cloak; and as many as touched it were being cured.
41厳 7:1 And the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together around Him when they had come from Jerusalem,
41厳 7:2 and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed.
41厳 7:3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, [thus] observing the traditions of the elders;
41厳 7:4 and [when they come] from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)
41厳 7:5 And the Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?"
41厳 7:6 And He said to them, "Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.
41厳 7:7 'BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.'
41厳 7:8 "Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men."
41厳 7:9 He was also saying to them, "You nicely set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.
41厳 7:10 "For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH';
41厳 7:11 but you say, 'If a man says to [his] father or [his] mother, anything of mine you might have been helped by is Corban (that is to say, given [to God]),'
41厳 7:12 you no longer permit him to do anything for [his] father or [his] mother;
41厳 7:13 [thus] invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that. "
41厳 7:14 And after He called the multitude to Him again, He [began] saying to them, "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand
41厳 7:15 there is nothing outside the man which going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man.
41厳 7:16 {"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."}
41厳 7:17 And when leaving the multitude, He had entered the house, His disciples questioned Him about the parable.
41厳 7:18 And He *said to them, "Are you so lacking in understanding also? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him;
41厳 7:19 because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated? "([Thus He] declared all foods clean.)
41厳 7:20 And He was saying, "That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man.
41厳 7:21 "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
41厳 7:22 deeds of coveting [and] wickedness, [as well as] deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride [and] foolishness.
41厳 7:23 "All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man."
41厳 7:24 And from there He arose and went away to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know [of it;] yet He could not escape notice.
41厳 7:25 But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, immediately came and fell at His feet.
41厳 7:26 Now the woman was a Gentile, of the Syrophoenician race. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
41厳 7:27 And He was saying to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
41厳 7:28 But she answered and *said to Him, "Yes, Lord, [but] even the dogs under the table feed on the children's crumbs."
41厳 7:29 And He said to her, "Because of this answer go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter."
41厳 7:30 And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having departed.
41厳 7:31 And again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of Decapolis.
41厳 7:32 And they *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *entreated Him to lay His hand upon him.
41厳 7:33 And He took him aside from the multitude by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue [with the saliva;]
41厳 7:34 and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He *said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"
41厳 7:35 And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he [began] speaking plainly.
41厳 7:36 And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it.
41厳 7:37 And they were utterly astonished, saying, "He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
41厳 8:1 In those days again, when there was a great multitude and they had nothing to eat, He called His disciples and *said to them,
41厳 8:2 "I feel compassion for the multitude because they have remained with Me now three days, and have nothing to eat;
41厳 8:3 and if I send them away hungry to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a distance. "
41厳 8:4 And His disciples answered Him, "Where will anyone be able to [find enough to] satisfy these men with bread here in a desolate place?"
41厳 8:5 And He was asking them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven."
41厳 8:6 And He *directed the multitude to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and started giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the multitude.
41厳 8:7 They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well.
41厳 8:8 And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces.
41厳 8:9 And about four thousand were [there;] and He sent them away.
41厳 8:10 And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples, and came to the district of Dalmanutha.
41厳 8:11 And the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, to test Him.
41厳 8:12 And sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, "Why does this generation seek for a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."
41厳 8:13 And leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side.
41厳 8:14 And they had forgotten to take bread; and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.
41厳 8:15 And He was giving orders to them, saying, "Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
41厳 8:16 And they [began] to discuss with one another [the fact] that they had no bread.
41厳 8:17 And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, "Why do you discuss [the fact] that you have no bread? Do you not yet see or understand? Do you have a hardened heart?
41厳 8:18 "HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember,
41厳 8:19 when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up? "They *said to Him," Twelve. "
41厳 8:20 "And when [I broke] the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?" And they *said to Him, " Seven. "
41厳 8:21 And He was saying to them, "Do you not yet understand?"
41厳 8:22 And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Him, and *entreated Him to touch him.
41厳 8:23 And taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes, and laying His hands upon him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?"
41厳 8:24 And he looked up and said, "I see men, for I am seeing [them] like trees, walking about."
41厳 8:25 Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and [began] to see everything clearly.
41厳 8:26 And He sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."
41厳 8:27 And Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, "Who do people say that I am?"
41厳 8:28 And they told Him, saying, "John the Baptist; and others [say] Elijah; but others, one of the prophets."
41厳 8:29 And He [continued] by questioning them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter *answered and *said to Him, "Thou art the Christ."
41厳 8:30 And He warned them to tell no one about Him.
41厳 8:31 And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
41厳 8:32 And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
41厳 8:33 But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, and * said, "Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's."
41厳 8:34 And He summoned the multitude with His disciples, and said to them, " If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
41厳 8:35 "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it.
41厳 8:36 "For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?
41厳 8:37 "For what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
41厳 8:38 "For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."
41厳 9:1 And He was saying to them, "Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."
41厳 9:2 And six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up to a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them;
41厳 9:3 and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
41厳 9:4 And Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
41厳 9:5 And Peter answered and *said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41厳 9:6 For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified.
41厳 9:7 Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!"
41厳 9:8 And all at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone.
41厳 9:9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man should rise from the dead.
41厳 9:10 And they seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead might mean.
41厳 9:11 And they asked Him, saying, ["Why is it] that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
41厳 9:12 And He said to them, "Elijah does first come and restore all things. And [yet] how is it written of the Son of Man that He should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
41厳 9:13 "But I say to you, that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him."
41厳 9:14 And when they came [back] to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and [some] scribes arguing with them.
41厳 9:15 And immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed, and [began] running up to greet Him.
41厳 9:16 And He asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"
41厳 9:17 And one of the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;
41厳 9:18 and whenever it seizes him, it dashes him [to the ground] and he foams [at the mouth,] and grinds his teeth, and stiffens out. And I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not [do it. "]
41厳 9:19 And He *answered them and *said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!"
41厳 9:20 And they brought the boy to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he [began] rolling about and foaming [at the mouth.]
41厳 9:21 And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said," From childhood.
41厳 9:22 "And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!"
41厳 9:23 And Jesus said to him, "'If You can!' All things are possible to him who believes."
41厳 9:24 Immediately the boy's father cried out and [began] saying, "I do believe; help my unbelief."
41厳 9:25 And when Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again."
41厳 9:26 And after crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and [the boy] became so much like a corpse that most [of them] said, "He is dead!"
41厳 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up.
41厳 9:28 And when He had come into [the] house, His disciples [began] questioning Him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
41厳 9:29 And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer."
41厳 9:30 And from there they went out and [began] to go through Galilee, and He was unwilling for anyone to know [about it.]
41厳 9:31 For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later."
41厳 9:32 But they did not understand [this] statement, and they were afraid to ask Him.
41厳 9:33 And they came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He [began] to question them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
41厳 9:34 But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which [of them was] the greatest.
41厳 9:35 And sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all."
41厳 9:36 And taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them,
41厳 9:37 "Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me."
41厳 9:38 John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to hinder him because he was not following us."
41厳 9:39 But Jesus said, "Do not hinder him, for there is no one who shall perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.
41厳 9:40 "For he who is not against us is for us.
41厳 9:41 "For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as [followers] of Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
41厳 9:42 "And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea.
41厳 9:43 "And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire,
41厳 9:44 {where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.}
41厳 9:45 "And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than having your two feet, to be cast into hell,
41厳 9:46 {where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.}
41厳 9:47 "And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into hell,
41厳 9:48 where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.
41厳 9:49 "For everyone will be salted with fire.
41厳 9:50 "Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty [again]? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
41厳 10:1 And rising up, He *went from there to the region of Judea, and beyond the Jordan; and crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more [began] to teach them.
41厳 10:2 And [some] Pharisees came up to Him, testing Him, and [began] to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife.
41厳 10:3 And He answered and said to them, "What did Moses command you?"
41厳 10:4 And they said, "Moses permitted [a man] TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND [her] AWAY."
41厳 10:5 But Jesus said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
41厳 10:6 "But from the beginning of creation, [God] MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE.
41厳 10:7 "FOR THIS CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER,
41厳 10:8 AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41厳 10:9 "What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
41厳 10:10 And in the house the disciples [began] questioning Him about this again.
41厳 10:11 And He *said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;
41厳 10:12 and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery. "
41厳 10:13 And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them.
41厳 10:14 But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, "Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41厳 10:15 "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it [at all.]"
41厳 10:16 And He took them in His arms and [began] blessing them, laying His hands upon them.
41厳 10:17 And as He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and [began] asking Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
41厳 10:18 And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.
41厳 10:19 "You know the commandments, 'DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'"
41厳 10:20 And he said to Him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up."
41厳 10:21 And looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him, and said to him, "One thing you lack go and sell all you possess, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
41厳 10:22 But at these words his face fell, and he went away grieved, for he was one who owned much property.
41厳 10:23 And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, "How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
41厳 10:24 And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
41厳 10:25 "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
41厳 10:26 And they were even more astonished and said to Him, "Then who can be saved?"
41厳 10:27 Looking upon them, Jesus *said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God."
41厳 10:28 Peter began to say to Him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed You."
41厳 10:29 Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel's sake,
41厳 10:30 but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
41厳 10:31 "But many [who are] first, will be last; and the last, first."
41厳 10:32 And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,
41厳 10:33 [saying,] "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death, and will deliver Him to the Gentiles.
41厳 10:34 "And they will mock Him and spit upon Him, and scourge Him, and kill [Him,] and three days later He will rise again."
41厳 10:35 And James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Him, saying to Him, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You."
41厳 10:36 And He said to them, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
41厳 10:37 And they said to Him, "Grant that we may sit in Your glory, one on Your right, and one on [Your] left."
41厳 10:38 But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
41厳 10:39 And they said to Him, "We are able." And Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
41厳 10:40 "But to sit on My right or on [My] left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."
41厳 10:41 And hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John.
41厳 10:42 And calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them.
41厳 10:43 "But it is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant;
41厳 10:44 and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
41厳 10:45 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."
41厳 10:46 And they *came to Jericho. And as He was going out from Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, a blind beggar [named] Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road.
41厳 10:47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41厳 10:48 And many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41厳 10:49 And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him [here.]" And they *called the blind man, saying to him, "Take courage, arise! He is calling for you."
41厳 10:50 And casting aside his cloak, he jumped up, and came to Jesus.
41厳 10:51 And answering him, Jesus said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" And the blind man said to Him," Rabboni, [I want] to regain my sight! "
41厳 10:52 And Jesus said to him, "Go your way; your faith has made you well." And immediately he regained his sight and [began] following Him on the road.
41厳 11:1 And as they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples,
41厳 11:2 and *said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied [there,] on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it [here.]
41厳 11:3 "And if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' you say, 'The Lord has need of it'; and immediately he will send it back here."
41厳 11:4 And they went away and found a colt tied at the door outside in the street; and they *untied it.
41厳 11:5 And some of the bystanders were saying to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"
41厳 11:6 And they spoke to them just as Jesus had told [them,] and they gave them permission.
41厳 11:7 And they *brought the colt to Jesus and put their garments on it; and He sat upon it.
41厳 11:8 And many spread their garments in the road, and others [spread] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.
41厳 11:9 And those who went before, and those who followed after, were crying out, "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD;
41厳 11:10 Blessed [is] the coming kingdom of our father David; Hosanna in the highest! "
41厳 11:11 And He entered Jerusalem [and came] into the temple; and after looking all around, He departed for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late.
41厳 11:12 And on the next day, when they had departed from Bethany, He became hungry.
41厳 11:13 And seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went [to see] if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
41厳 11:14 And He answered and said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" And His disciples were listening.
41厳 11:15 And they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to cast out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were selling doves;
41厳 11:16 and He would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple.
41厳 11:17 And He [began] to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, ' MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS'? But you have made it a Robbers' DEN."
41厳 11:18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard [this], and [began] seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for all the multitude was astonished at His teaching.
41厳 11:19 And whenever evening came, they would go out of the city.
41厳 11:20 And as they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots [up.]
41厳 11:21 And being reminded, Peter *said to Him, "Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered."
41厳 11:22 And Jesus *answered saying to them, "Have faith in God.
41厳 11:23 "Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it shall be [granted] him.
41厳 11:24 "Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they shall be [granted] you.
41厳 11:25 "And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your transgressions.
41厳 11:26 {"But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions."}
41厳 11:27 And they *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders *came to Him,
41厳 11:28 and [began] saying to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?"
41厳 11:29 And Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and [then] I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
41厳 11:30 "Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me."
41厳 11:31 And they [began] reasoning among themselves, saying, "If we say, ' From heaven, 'He will say,' Then why did you not believe him? '
41厳 11:32 "But shall we say, 'From men'?"-- they were afraid of the multitude, for all considered John to have been a prophet indeed.
41厳 11:33 And answering Jesus, they *said, "We do not know." And Jesus *said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
41厳 12:1 And He began to speak to them in parables "A man PLANTED A VINEYARD, AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS, AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey.
41厳 12:2 "And at the [harvest] time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive [some] of the produce of the vineyard from the vine-growers.
41厳 12:3 "And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
41厳 12:4 "And again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.
41厳 12:5 "And he sent another, and that one they killed; and [so with] many others, beating some, and killing others.
41厳 12:6 "He had one more [to send,] a beloved son; he sent him last [of all] to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
41厳 12:7 "But those vine-growers said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!'
41厳 12:8 "And they took him, and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
41厳 12:9 "What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others.
41厳 12:10 "Have you not even read this Scripture 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER [stone];
41厳 12:11 THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES '? "
41厳 12:12 And they were seeking to seize Him; and [yet] they feared the multitude; for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And [ so] they left Him, and went away.
41厳 12:13 And they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him, in order to trap Him in a statement.
41厳 12:14 And they *came and *said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?
41厳 12:15 "Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?" But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at."
41厳 12:16 And they brought [one.] And He *said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" And they said to Him, "Caesar's."
41厳 12:17 And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at Him.
41厳 12:18 And [some] Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) *came to Him, and [began] questioning Him, saying,
41厳 12:19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A Man's BROTHER DIES, and leaves behind a wife, AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD TAKE THE WIFE, AND RAISE UP OFFSPRING TO HIS BROTHER.
41厳 12:20 "There were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died, leaving no offspring.
41厳 12:21 "And the second one took her, and died, leaving behind no offspring; and the third likewise;
41厳 12:22 and [so] all seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.
41厳 12:23 "In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife."
41厳 12:24 Jesus said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures, or the power of God?
41厳 12:25 "For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
41厳 12:26 "But regarding the fact that the dead rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the [passage about the burning] bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'?
41厳 12:27 "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken."
41厳 12:28 And one of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, "What commandment is the foremost of all?"
41厳 12:29 Jesus answered, "The foremost is, 'HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD;
41厳 12:30 AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH. '
41厳 12:31 "The second is this, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
41厳 12:32 And the scribe said to Him, "Right, Teacher, You have truly stated that HE IS ONE; AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM;
41厳 12:33 AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE One's NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. "
41厳 12:34 And when Jesus saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that, no one would venture to ask Him any more questions.
41厳 12:35 And Jesus answering [began] to say, as He taught in the temple, " How [is it that] the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
41厳 12:36 "David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD," SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT THINE ENEMIES BENEATH THY FEET. ' "
41厳 12:37 "David himself calls Him 'Lord'; and [so] in what sense is He his son?" And the great crowd enjoyed listening to Him.
41厳 12:38 And in His teaching He was saying "Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes, and [like] respectful greetings in the market places,
41厳 12:39 and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at banquets,
41厳 12:40 who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation. "
41厳 12:41 And He sat down opposite the treasury, and [began] observing how the multitude were putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums.
41厳 12:42 And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amount to a cent.
41厳 12:43 And calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury;
41厳 12:44 for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on. "
41厳 13:1 And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, "Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!"
41厳 13:2 And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another which will not be torn down."
41厳 13:3 And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately,
41厳 13:4 "Tell us, when will these things be, and what [will be] the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?"
41厳 13:5 And Jesus began to say to them, "See to it that no one misleads you.
41厳 13:6 "Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am [He!'] and will mislead many.
41厳 13:7 "And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened; [those things] must take place; but [that is] not yet the end.
41厳 13:8 "For nation will arise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will [also] be famines. These things are [merely] the beginning of birth pangs.
41厳 13:9 "But be on your guard; for they will deliver you to [the] courts, and you will be flogged in [the] synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.
41厳 13:10 "And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
41厳 13:11 "And when they arrest you and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but [it is] the Holy Spirit.
41厳 13:12 "And brother will deliver brother to death, and a father [his] child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
41厳 13:13 "And you will be hated by all on account of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved.
41厳 13:14 "But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
41厳 13:15 "And let him who is on the housetop not go down, or enter in, to get anything out of his house;
41厳 13:16 and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak.
41厳 13:17 "But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days!
41厳 13:18 "But pray that it may not happen in the winter.
41厳 13:19 "For those days will be a [time of] tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created, until now, and never shall.
41厳 13:20 "And unless the Lord had shortened [those] days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect whom He chose, He shortened the days.
41厳 13:21 "And then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ'; or, ' Behold, [He is] there ';do not believe [him;]
41厳 13:22 for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order, if possible, to lead the elect astray.
41厳 13:23 "But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance.
41厳 13:24 "But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT,
41厳 13:25 AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
41厳 13:26 "And then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.
41厳 13:27 "And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth, to the farthest end of heaven.
41厳 13:28 "Now learn the parable from the fig tree when its branch has already become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
41厳 13:29 "Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, [right] at the door.
41厳 13:30 "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
41厳 13:31 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
41厳 13:32 "But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father [alone.]
41厳 13:33 "Take heed, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the [appointed] time is.
41厳 13:34 ["It is] like a man, away on a journey, [who] upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge, [assigning] to each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert.
41厳 13:35 "Therefore, be on the alert-- for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, at cockcrowing, or in the morning--
41厳 13:36 lest he come suddenly and find you asleep.
41厳 13:37 "And what I say to you I say to all, 'Be on the alert!'"
41厳 14:1 Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread was two days off; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to seize Him by stealth, and kill [Him;]
41厳 14:2 for they were saying, "Not during the festival, lest there be a riot of the people."
41厳 14:3 And while He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining [at the table,] there came a woman with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume of pure nard; [and] she broke the vial and poured it over His head.
41厳 14:4 But some were indignantly [remarking] to one another, "Why has this perfume been wasted?
41厳 14:5 "For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and [the money] given to the poor." And they were scolding her.
41厳 14:6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you bother her? She has done a good deed to Me.
41厳 14:7 "For the poor you always have with you, and whenever you wish, you can do them good; but you do not always have Me.
41厳 14:8 "She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.
41厳 14:9 "And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of in memory of her."
41厳 14:10 And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests, in order to betray Him to them.
41厳 14:11 And they were glad when they heard [this,] and promised to give him money. And he [began] seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time.
41厳 14:12 And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover [lamb] was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
41厳 14:13 And He *sent two of His disciples, and *said to them, "Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;
41厳 14:14 and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"'
41厳 14:15 "And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished [and] ready; and prepare for us there."
41厳 14:16 And the disciples went out, and came to the city, and found [it] just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
41厳 14:17 And when it was evening He *came with the twelve.
41厳 14:18 And as they were reclining [at the table] and eating, Jesus said, " Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me-- one who is eating with Me. "
41厳 14:19 They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, "Surely not I?"
41厳 14:20 And He said to them, ["It is] one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the bowl.
41厳 14:21 "For the Son of Man [is to] go, just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! [It would have been] good for that man if he had not been born."
41厳 14:22 And while they were eating, He took [some] bread, and after a blessing He broke [it]; and gave [it] to them, and said, "Take [it]; this is My body."
41厳 14:23 And when He had taken a cup, [and] given thanks, He gave [it] to them; and they all drank from it.
41厳 14:24 And He said to them, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
41厳 14:25 "Truly I say to you, I shall never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41厳 14:26 And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41厳 14:27 And Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.'
41厳 14:28 "But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."
41厳 14:29 But Peter said to Him, "[Even] though all may fall away, yet I will not."
41厳 14:30 And Jesus *said to him, "Truly I say to you, that you yourself this very night, before a cock crows twice, shall three times deny Me."
41厳 14:31 But [Peter] kept saying insistently, "[Even] if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And they all were saying the same thing, too.
41厳 14:32 And they *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, "Sit here until I have prayed."
41厳 14:33 And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled.
41厳 14:34 And He *said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch."
41厳 14:35 And He went a little beyond [them,] and fell to the ground, and [began] to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by.
41厳 14:36 And He was saying, "Abba! Father! All things are possible for Thee; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what Thou wilt."
41厳 14:37 And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
41厳 14:38 "Keep watching and praying, that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41厳 14:39 And again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.
41厳 14:40 And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.
41厳 14:41 And He *came the third time, and *said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
41厳 14:42 "Arise, let us be going; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!"
41厳 14:43 And immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up, accompanied by a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
41厳 14:44 Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is the one; seize Him, and lead Him away under guard."
41厳 14:45 And after coming, he immediately went to Him, saying, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
41厳 14:46 And they laid hands on Him, and seized Him.
41厳 14:47 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
41厳 14:48 And Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as against a robber?
41厳 14:49 "Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but [this has happened] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
41厳 14:50 And they all left Him and fled.
41厳 14:51 And a certain young man was following Him, wearing [nothing but] a linen sheet over [his] naked [body;] and they *seized him.
41厳 14:52 But he left the linen sheet behind, and escaped naked.
41厳 14:53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together.
41厳 14:54 And Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself at the fire.
41厳 14:55 Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death; and they were not finding any.
41厳 14:56 For many were giving false testimony against Him, and [yet] their testimony was not consistent.
41厳 14:57 And some stood up and [began] to give false testimony against Him, saying,
41厳 14:58 "We heard Him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'"
41厳 14:59 And not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.
41厳 14:60 And the high priest stood up [and came] forward and questioned Jesus, saying, "Do You make no answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?"
41厳 14:61 But He kept silent, and made no answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and saying to Him, "Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed [One?]"
41厳 14:62 And Jesus said, "I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN."
41厳 14:63 And tearing his clothes, the high priest *said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?
41厳 14:64 "You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
41厳 14:65 And some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!" And the officers received Him with slaps [in the face.]
41厳 14:66 And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came,
41厳 14:67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and *said, "You, too, were with Jesus the Nazarene."
41厳 14:68 But he denied [it,] saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are talking about." And he went out onto the porch.
41厳 14:69 And the maid saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders, "This is [one] of them!"
41厳 14:70 But again he was denying it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, "Surely you are [one] of them, for you are a Galilean too."
41厳 14:71 But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!"
41厳 14:72 And immediately a cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him, "Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times." And he began to weep.
41厳 15:1 And early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole Council, immediately held a consultation; and binding Jesus, they led Him away, and delivered Him up to Pilate.
41厳 15:2 And Pilate questioned Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And answering He *said to him, "[It is as] you say."
41厳 15:3 And the chief priests [began] to accuse Him harshly.
41厳 15:4 And Pilate was questioning Him again, saying, "Do You make no answer? See how many charges they bring against You!"
41厳 15:5 But Jesus made no further answer; so that Pilate was amazed.
41厳 15:6 Now at [the] feast he used to release for them [any] one prisoner whom they requested.
41厳 15:7 And the man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
41厳 15:8 And the multitude went up and began asking him [to do] as he had been accustomed to do for them.
41厳 15:9 And Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
41厳 15:10 For he was aware that the chief priests had delivered Him up because of envy.
41厳 15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude [to ask] him to release Barabbas for them instead.
41厳 15:12 And answering again, Pilate was saying to them, "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
41厳 15:13 And they shouted back, "Crucify Him!"
41厳 15:14 But Pilate was saying to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!"
41厳 15:15 And wishing to satisfy the multitude, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he delivered [Him] to be crucified.
41厳 15:16 And the soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole [Roman] cohort.
41厳 15:17 And they *dressed Him up in purple, and after weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;
41厳 15:18 and they began to acclaim Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
41厳 15:19 And they kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting at Him, and kneeling and bowing before Him.
41厳 15:20 And after they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, and put His garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him.
41厳 15:21 And they *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to bear His cross.
41厳 15:22 And they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.
41厳 15:23 And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
41厳 15:24 And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them, [to decide] what each should take.
41厳 15:25 And it was the third hour when they crucified Him.
41厳 15:26 And the inscription of the charge against Him read, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41厳 15:27 And they *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.
41厳 15:28 {And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with transgressors."}
41厳 15:29 And those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who [are going to] destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
41厳 15:30 save Yourself, and come down from the cross! "
41厳 15:31 In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking [Him] among themselves and saying, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself.
41厳 15:32 "Let [this] Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!" And those who were crucified with Him were casting the same insult at Him.
41厳 15:33 And when the sixth hour had come, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
41厳 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?" which is translated, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?"
41厳 15:35 And when some of the bystanders heard it, they [began] saying, "Behold, He is calling for Elijah."
41厳 15:36 And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down."
41厳 15:37 And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.
41厳 15:38 And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
41厳 15:39 And when the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
41厳 15:40 And there were also [some] women looking on from a distance, among whom [were] Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.
41厳 15:41 And when He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and minister to Him; and [there were] many other women who had come up with Him to Jerusalem.
41厳 15:42 And when evening had already come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
41厳 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
41厳 15:44 And Pilate wondered if He was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.
41厳 15:45 And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
41厳 15:46 And [Joseph] bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
41厳 15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the [mother] of Joses were looking on [ to see] where He was laid.
41厳 16:1 And when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him.
41厳 16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen.
41厳 16:3 And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"
41厳 16:4 And looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was extremely large.
41厳 16:5 And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed.
41厳 16:6 And he *said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, [ here is] the place where they laid Him.
41厳 16:7 "But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He said to you.'"
41厳 16:8 And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
41厳 16:9 {Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
41厳 16:10 She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping.
41厳 16:11 And when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.
41厳 16:12 And after that, He appeared in a different form to two of them, while they were walking along on their way to the country.
41厳 16:13 And they went away and reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.
41厳 16:14 And afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining [at the table;] and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.
41厳 16:15 And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
41厳 16:16 "He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.
41厳 16:17 "And these signs will accompany those who have believed in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues;
41厳 16:18 they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly [poison,] it shall not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. "
41厳 16:19 So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
41厳 16:20 And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the word by the signs that followed.} {[And they promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]}

42勘 1:1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished among us,
42勘 1:2 just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word have handed them down to us,
42勘 1:3 it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write [it] out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus;
42勘 1:4 so that you might know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
42勘 1:5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
42勘 1:6 And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord.
42勘 1:7 And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
42勘 1:8 Now it came about, while he was performing his priestly service before God in the [appointed] order of his division,
42勘 1:9 according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
42勘 1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside at the hour of the incense offering.
42勘 1:11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.
42勘 1:12 And Zacharias was troubled when he saw [him,] and fear gripped him.
42勘 1:13 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.
42勘 1:14 "And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
42勘 1:15 "For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine or liquor; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, while yet in his mother's womb.
42勘 1:16 "And he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.
42勘 1:17 "And it is he who will go [as a forerunner] before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous; so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42勘 1:18 And Zacharias said to the angel, "How shall I know this [for certain]? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
42勘 1:19 And the angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
42勘 1:20 "And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time."
42勘 1:21 And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering at his delay in the temple.
42勘 1:22 But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he kept making signs to them, and remained mute.
42勘 1:23 And it came about, when the days of his priestly service were ended, that he went back home.
42勘 1:24 And after these days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant; and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,
42勘 1:25 "This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked [with favor] upon [me,] to take away my disgrace among men."
42勘 1:26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee, called Nazareth,
42勘 1:27 to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
42勘 1:28 And coming in, he said to her, "Hail, favored one! The Lord [is] with you."
42勘 1:29 But she was greatly troubled at [this] statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this might be.
42勘 1:30 And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.
42勘 1:31 "And behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.
42勘 1:32 "He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;
42勘 1:33 and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and His kingdom will have no end. "
42勘 1:34 And Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
42勘 1:35 And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy offspring shall be called the Son of God.
42勘 1:36 "And behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month.
42勘 1:37 "For nothing will be impossible with God."
42勘 1:38 And Mary said, "Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; be it done to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
42勘 1:39 Now at this time Mary arose and went with haste to the hill country, to a city of Judah,
42勘 1:40 and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
42勘 1:41 And it came about that when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42勘 1:42 And she cried out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed among women [are] you, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb!
42勘 1:43 "And how has it [happened] to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42勘 1:44 "For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.
42勘 1:45 "And blessed [is] she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord."
42勘 1:46 And Mary said "My soul exalts the Lord,
42勘 1:47 And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
42勘 1:48 "For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
42勘 1:49 "For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.
42勘 1:50 "AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM.
42勘 1:51 "He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered [those who were] proud in the thoughts of their heart.
42勘 1:52 "He has brought down rulers from [their] thrones, And has exalted those who were humble.
42勘 1:53 "HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; AND SENT AWAY THE RICH Empty-handed.
42勘 1:54 "He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance of His mercy,
42勘 1:55 As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his offspring forever. "
42勘 1:56 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and [then] returned to her home.
42勘 1:57 Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she brought forth a son.
42勘 1:58 And her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had displayed His great mercy toward her; and they were rejoicing with her.
42勘 1:59 And it came about that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zacharias, after his father.
42勘 1:60 And his mother answered and said, "No indeed; but he shall be called John."
42勘 1:61 And they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name."
42勘 1:62 And they made signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called.
42勘 1:63 And he asked for a tablet, and wrote as follows, "His name is John." And they were all astonished.
42勘 1:64 And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue [loosed,] and he [began] to speak in praise of God.
42勘 1:65 And fear came on all those living around them; and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea.
42勘 1:66 And all who heard them kept them in mind, saying, "What then will this child [turn out to] be?" For the hand of the Lord was certainly with him.
42勘 1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying
42勘 1:68 "Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel, For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,
42勘 1:69 And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of David His servant--
42勘 1:70 As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old--
42勘 1:71 Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES, And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US;
42勘 1:72 To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His holy covenant,
42勘 1:73 The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
42勘 1:74 To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, Might serve Him without fear,
42勘 1:75 In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
42勘 1:76 "And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS;
42勘 1:77 To give to His people [the] knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins,
42勘 1:78 Because of the tender mercy of our God, With which the Sunrise from on high shall visit us,
42勘 1:79 TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace. "
42勘 1:80 And the child continued to grow, and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the deserts until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
42勘 2:1 Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.
42勘 2:2 This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
42勘 2:3 And all were proceeding to register for the census, everyone to his own city.
42勘 2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
42勘 2:5 in order to register, along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.
42勘 2:6 And it came about that while they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
42勘 2:7 And she gave birth to her first-born son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
42勘 2:8 And in the same region there were [some] shepherds staying out in the fields, and keeping watch over their flock by night.
42勘 2:9 And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.
42勘 2:10 And the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which shall be for all the people;
42勘 2:11 for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
42勘 2:12 "And this [will be] a sign for you you will find a baby wrapped in cloths, and lying in a manger."
42勘 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
42勘 2:14 "Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased."
42勘 2:15 And it came about when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds [began] saying to one another, "Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us."
42勘 2:16 And they came in haste and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.
42勘 2:17 And when they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.
42勘 2:18 And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
42勘 2:19 But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.
42勘 2:20 And the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.
42勘 2:21 And when eight days were completed before His circumcision, His name was [then] called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
42勘 2:22 And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
42勘 2:23 (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "EVERY [first-born] MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD"),
42勘 2:24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, "A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES, OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS."
42勘 2:25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
42勘 2:26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
42勘 2:27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law,
42勘 2:28 then he took Him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
42勘 2:29 "Now Lord, Thou dost let Thy bond-servant depart In peace, according to Thy word;
42勘 2:30 For my eyes have seen Thy salvation,
42勘 2:31 Which Thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples,
42勘 2:32 A LIGHT OF REVELATION TO THE GENTILES, And the glory of Thy people Israel. "
42勘 2:33 And His father and mother were amazed at the things which were being said about Him.
42勘 2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this [Child] is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed--
42勘 2:35 and a sword will pierce even your own soul-- to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed. "
42勘 2:36 And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with a husband seven years after her marriage,
42勘 2:37 and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. And she never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.
42勘 2:38 And at that very moment she came up and [began] giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
42勘 2:39 And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.
42勘 2:40 And the Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
42勘 2:41 And His parents used to go to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
42勘 2:42 And when He became twelve, they went up [there] according to the custom of the Feast;
42勘 2:43 and as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. And His parents were unaware of it,
42勘 2:44 but supposed Him to be in the caravan, and went a day's journey; and they [began] looking for Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
42勘 2:45 And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for Him.
42勘 2:46 And it came about that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
42勘 2:47 And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
42勘 2:48 And when they saw Him, they were astonished; and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You."
42勘 2:49 And He said to them, "Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father's [house?"]
42勘 2:50 And they did not understand the statement which He had made to them.
42勘 2:51 And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and He continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all [these] things in her heart.
42勘 2:52 And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
42勘 3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
42勘 3:2 in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
42勘 3:3 And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;
42勘 3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, " THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.
42勘 3:5 'EVERY RAVINE SHALL BE FILLED UP, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL SHALL BE BROUGHT LOW; AND THE CROOKED SHALL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH;
42勘 3:6 AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD. '"
42勘 3:7 He therefore [began] saying to the multitudes who were going out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
42勘 3:8 "Therefore bring forth fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I say to you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
42勘 3:9 "And also the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
42勘 3:10 And the multitudes were questioning him, saying, "Then what shall we do?"
42勘 3:11 And he would answer and say to them, "Let the man who has two tunics share with him who has none; and let him who has food do likewise."
42勘 3:12 And [some] tax-gatherers also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
42勘 3:13 And he said to them, "Collect no more than what you have been ordered to."
42勘 3:14 And [some] soldiers were questioning him, saying, "And [what about] us, what shall we do?" And he said to them, "Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse [anyone] falsely, and be content with your wages."
42勘 3:15 Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were wondering in their hearts about John, as to whether he might be the Christ,
42勘 3:16 John answered and said to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42勘 3:17 "And His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
42勘 3:18 So with many other exhortations also he preached the gospel to the people.
42勘 3:19 But when Herod the tetrarch was reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and on account of all the wicked things which Herod had done,
42勘 3:20 he added this also to them all, that he locked John up in prison.
42勘 3:21 Now it came about when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened,
42勘 3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, "Thou art My beloved Son, in Thee I am well-pleased."
42勘 3:23 And when He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being supposedly [the] son of Joseph, the [son] of Eli,
42勘 3:24 the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi, the [son] of Melchi, the [ son] of Jannai, the [son] of Joseph,
42勘 3:25 the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Amos, the [son] of Nahum, the [son] of Hesli, the [son] of Naggai,
42勘 3:26 the [son] of Maath, the [son] of Mattathias, the [son] of Semein, the [son] of Josech, the [son] of Joda,
42勘 3:27 the [son] of Joanan, the [son] of Rhesa, the [son] of Zerubbabel, the [son] of Shealtiel, the [son] of Neri,
42勘 3:28 the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Addi, the [son] of Cosam, the [son] of Elmadam, the [son] of Er,
42勘 3:29 the [son] of Joshua, the [son] of Eliezer, the [son] of Jorim, the [ son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi,
42勘 3:30 the [son] of Simeon, the [son] of Judah, the [son] of Joseph, the [ son] of Jonam, the [son] of Eliakim,
42勘 3:31 the [son] of Melea, the [son] of Menna, the [son] of Mattatha, the [ son] of Nathan, the [son] of David,
42勘 3:32 the [son] of Jesse, the [son] of Obed, the [son] of Boaz, the [son] of Salmon, the [son] of Nahshon,
42勘 3:33 the [son] of Amminadab, the [son] of Admin, the [son] of Ram, the [ son] of Hezron, the [son] of Perez, the [son] of Judah,
42勘 3:34 the [son] of Jacob, the [son] of Isaac, the [son] of Abraham, the [ son] of Terah, the [son] of Nahor,
42勘 3:35 the [son] of Serug, the [son] of Reu, the [son] of Peleg, the [son] of Heber, the [son] of Shelah,
42勘 3:36 the [son] of Cainan, the [son] of Arphaxad, the [son] of Shem, the [ son] of Noah, the [son] of Lamech,
42勘 3:37 the [son] of Methuselah, the [son] of Enoch, the [son] of Jared, the [son] of Mahalaleel, the [son] of Cainan,
42勘 3:38 the [son] of Enosh, the [son] of Seth, the [son] of Adam, the [son] of God.
42勘 4:1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led about by the Spirit in the wilderness
42勘 4:2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days; and when they had ended, He became hungry.
42勘 4:3 And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
42勘 4:4 And Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.'"
42勘 4:5 And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
42勘 4:6 And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.
42勘 4:7 "Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours."
42勘 4:8 And Jesus answered and said to him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'"
42勘 4:9 And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here;
42勘 4:10 for it is written, 'HE WILL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,'
42勘 4:11 and, 'ON [their] HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.' "
42勘 4:12 And Jesus answered and said to him, "It is said, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'"
42勘 4:13 And when the devil had finished every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.
42勘 4:14 And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit; and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district.
42勘 4:15 And He [began] teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all.
42勘 4:16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.
42勘 4:17 And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
42勘 4:18 "THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE DOWNTRODDEN,
42勘 4:19 TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD. "
42勘 4:20 And He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon Him.
42勘 4:21 And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
42勘 4:22 And all were speaking well of Him, and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from His lips; and they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?"
42勘 4:23 And He said to them, "No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, ' Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum, do here in your home town as well. '"
42勘 4:24 And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his home town.
42勘 4:25 "But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;
42勘 4:26 and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, [in the land] of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
42勘 4:27 "And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian."
42勘 4:28 And all in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things;
42勘 4:29 and they rose up and cast Him out of the city, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff.
42勘 4:30 But passing through their midst, He went His way.
42勘 4:31 And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And He was teaching them on the Sabbath;
42勘 4:32 and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority.
42勘 4:33 And there was a man in the synagogue possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
42勘 4:34 "Ha! What do we have to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-- the Holy One of God!"
42勘 4:35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in [their] midst, he came out of him without doing him any harm.
42勘 4:36 And amazement came upon them all, and they [began] discussing with one another saying, "What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."
42勘 4:37 And the report about Him was getting out into every locality in the surrounding district.
42勘 4:38 And He arose and [left] the synagogue, and entered Simon's home. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever; and they made request of Him on her behalf.
42勘 4:39 And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and she immediately arose and waited on them.
42勘 4:40 And while the sun was setting, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and laying His hands on every one of them, He was healing them.
42勘 4:41 And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Son of God!" And rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ.
42勘 4:42 And when day came, He departed and went to a lonely place; and the multitudes were searching for Him, and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from going away from them.
42勘 4:43 But He said to them, "I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose."
42勘 4:44 And He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
42勘 5:1 Now it came about that while the multitude were pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
42勘 5:2 and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them, and were washing their nets.
42勘 5:3 And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and [began] teaching the multitudes from the boat.
42勘 5:4 And when He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
42勘 5:5 And Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but at Your bidding I will let down the nets."
42勘 5:6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish; and their nets [began] to break;
42勘 5:7 and they signaled to their partners in the other boat, for them to come and help them. And they came, and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink.
42勘 5:8 But when Simon Peter saw [that,] he fell down at Jesus' feet, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"
42勘 5:9 For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken;
42勘 5:10 and so also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men."
42勘 5:11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.
42勘 5:12 And it came about that while He was in one of the cities, behold, [ there was] a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
42勘 5:13 And He stretched out His hand, and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." And immediately the leprosy left him.
42勘 5:14 And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
42勘 5:15 But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and great multitudes were gathering to hear [Him] and to be healed of their sicknesses.
42勘 5:16 But He Himself would [often] slip away to the wilderness and pray.
42勘 5:17 And it came about one day that He was teaching; and there were [some] Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting [there,] who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and [from] Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was [present] for Him to perform healing.
42勘 5:18 And behold, [some] men [were] carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in, and to set him down in front of Him.
42勘 5:19 And not finding any [way] to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, right in the center, in front of Jesus.
42勘 5:20 And seeing their faith, He said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven you."
42勘 5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this [man] who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
42勘 5:22 But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
42勘 5:23 "Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins have been forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?
42勘 5:24 "But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,"-- He said to the paralytic-- "I say to you, rise, and take up your stretcher and go home."
42勘 5:25 And at once he rose up before them, and took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.
42勘 5:26 And they were all seized with astonishment and [began] glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen remarkable things today."
42勘 5:27 And after that He went out, and noticed a tax-gatherer named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me."
42勘 5:28 And he left everything behind, and rose and [began] to follow Him.
42勘 5:29 And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax-gatherers and other [people] who were reclining [at the table] with them.
42勘 5:30 And the Pharisees and their scribes [began] grumbling at His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax-gatherers and sinners?"
42勘 5:31 And Jesus answered and said to them, "[It is] not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.
42勘 5:32 "I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."
42勘 5:33 And they said to Him, "The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers; the [disciples] of the Pharisees also do the same; but Yours eat and drink."
42勘 5:34 And Jesus said to them, "You cannot make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?
42勘 5:35 "But [the] days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days."
42勘 5:36 And He was also telling them a parable "No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
42勘 5:37 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined.
42勘 5:38 "But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
42勘 5:39 "And no one, after drinking old [wine] wishes for new; for he says, ' The old is good [enough.] '"
42勘 6:1 Now it came about that on a [certain] Sabbath He was passing through [some] grainfields; and His disciples were picking and eating the heads [of grain,] rubbing them in their hands.
42勘 6:2 But some of the Pharisees said, "Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
42勘 6:3 And Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,
42勘 6:4 how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions? "
42勘 6:5 And He was saying to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42勘 6:6 And it came about on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
42勘 6:7 And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely, [to see] if He healed on the Sabbath, in order that they might find [reason] to accuse Him.
42勘 6:8 But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise and come forward!" And he rose and came forward.
42勘 6:9 And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm, to save a life, or to destroy it?"
42勘 6:10 And after looking around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand!" And he did [so;] and his hand was restored.
42勘 6:11 But they themselves were filled with rage, and discussed together what they might do to Jesus.
42勘 6:12 And it was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
42勘 6:13 And when day came, He called His disciples to Him; and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles
42勘 6:14 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;
42勘 6:15 and Matthew and Thomas; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot;
42勘 6:16 Judas [the son] of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42勘 6:17 And He descended with them, and stood on a level place; and [there was] a great multitude of His disciples, and a great throng of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,
42勘 6:18 who had come to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
42勘 6:19 And all the multitude were trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing [them] all.
42勘 6:20 And turning His gaze on His disciples, He [began] to say, "Blessed [are] you [who are] poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
42勘 6:21 "Blessed [are] you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed [are] you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
42勘 6:22 "Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and cast insults at you, and spurn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man.
42勘 6:23 "Be glad in that day, and leap [for joy,] for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets.
42勘 6:24 "But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full.
42勘 6:25 "Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry. Woe [to you] who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
42勘 6:26 "Woe [to you] when all men speak well of you, for in the same way their fathers used to treat the false prophets.
42勘 6:27 "But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42勘 6:28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42勘 6:29 "Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.
42勘 6:30 "Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back.
42勘 6:31 "And just as you want people to treat you, treat them in the same way.
42勘 6:32 "And if you love those who love you, what credit is [that] to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
42勘 6:33 "And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is [that] to you? For even sinners do the same.
42勘 6:34 "And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is [that] to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, in order to receive back the same [amount.]
42勘 6:35 "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil [men.]
42勘 6:36 "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
42勘 6:37 "And do not judge and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.
42勘 6:38 "Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return."
42勘 6:39 And He also spoke a parable to them "A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?
42勘 6:40 "A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher.
42勘 6:41 "And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
42勘 6:42 "Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.
42勘 6:43 "For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit; nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit.
42勘 6:44 "For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush.
42勘 6:45 "The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil [man] out of the evil [treasure] brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.
42勘 6:46 "And why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
42勘 6:47 "Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My words, and acts upon them, I will show you whom he is like
42勘 6:48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood rose, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
42勘 6:49 "But the one who has heard, and has not acted [accordingly,] is like a man who built a house upon the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great."
42勘 7:1 When He had completed all His discourse in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum.
42勘 7:2 And a certain centurion's slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die.
42勘 7:3 And when he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave.
42勘 7:4 And when they had come to Jesus, they earnestly entreated Him, saying, "He is worthy for You to grant this to him;
42勘 7:5 for he loves our nation, and it was he who built us our synagogue. "
42勘 7:6 Now Jesus [started] on His way with them; and when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy for You to come under my roof;
42勘 7:7 for this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but [just] say the word, and my servant will be healed.
42勘 7:8 "For I, too, am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it."
42勘 7:9 Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude that was following Him, "I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith."
42勘 7:10 And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
42勘 7:11 And it came about soon afterwards, that He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large multitude.
42勘 7:12 Now as He approached the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
42勘 7:13 And when the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her, and said to her, "Do not weep."
42勘 7:14 And He came up and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!"
42勘 7:15 And the dead man sat up, and began to speak. And [Jesus] gave him back to his mother.
42勘 7:16 And fear gripped them all, and they [began] glorifying God, saying, " A great prophet has arisen among us! "and," God has visited His people! "
42勘 7:17 And this report concerning Him went out all over Judea, and in all the surrounding district.
42勘 7:18 And the disciples of John reported to him about all these things.
42勘 7:19 And summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, "Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?"
42勘 7:20 And when the men had come to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You the Expected One, or do we look for someone else?'"
42勘 7:21 At that very time He cured many [people] of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits; and He granted sight to many [who were] blind.
42勘 7:22 And He answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard [the] BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, [the] lame walk, [the] lepers are cleansed, and [the] deaf hear, [the] dead are raised up, [the] POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
42勘 7:23 "And blessed is he who keeps from stumbling over Me."
42勘 7:24 And when the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
42勘 7:25 "But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are [found] in royal palaces.
42勘 7:26 "But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and one who is more than a prophet.
42勘 7:27 "This is the one about whom it is written, 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'
42勘 7:28 "I say to you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42勘 7:29 And when all the people and the tax-gatherers heard [this,] they acknowledged God's justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John.
42勘 7:30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John.
42勘 7:31 "To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?
42勘 7:32 "They are like children who sit in the market place and call to one another; and they say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
42勘 7:33 "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine; and you say, 'He has a demon!'
42勘 7:34 "The Son of Man has come eating and drinking; and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners!'
42勘 7:35 "Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
42勘 7:36 Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to dine with him. And He entered the Pharisee's house, and reclined [at the table.]
42勘 7:37 And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining [at the table] in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume,
42勘 7:38 and standing behind [Him] at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet, and anointing them with the perfume.
42勘 7:39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner."
42勘 7:40 And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." And he replied, "Say it, Teacher."
42勘 7:41 "A certain moneylender had two debtors one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42勘 7:42 "When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?"
42勘 7:43 Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more." And He said to him," You have judged correctly. "
42勘 7:44 And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
42勘 7:45 "You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.
42勘 7:46 "You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume.
42勘 7:47 "For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but he who is forgiven little, loves little."
42勘 7:48 And He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven."
42勘 7:49 And those who were reclining [at the table] with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this [man] who even forgives sins?"
42勘 7:50 And He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
42勘 8:1 And it came about soon afterwards, that He [began] going about from one city and village to another, proclaiming and preaching the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him,
42勘 8:2 and [also] some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
42勘 8:3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were contributing to their support out of their private means.
42勘 8:4 And when a great multitude were coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable
42勘 8:5 "The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road; and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the air ate it up.
42勘 8:6 "And other [seed] fell on rocky [soil,] and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
42勘 8:7 "And other [seed] fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it, and choked it out.
42勘 8:8 "And other [seed] fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great." As He said these things, He would call out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
42勘 8:9 And His disciples [began] questioning Him as to what this parable might be.
42勘 8:10 And He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest [it is] in parables, in order that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.
42勘 8:11 "Now the parable is this the seed is the word of God.
42勘 8:12 "And those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.
42勘 8:13 "And those on the rocky [soil are] those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no [firm] root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away.
42勘 8:14 "And the [seed] which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
42勘 8:15 "And the [seed] in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance.
42勘 8:16 "Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, in order that those who come in may see the light.
42勘 8:17 "For nothing is hidden that shall not become evident, nor [anything] secret that shall not be known and come to light.
42勘 8:18 "Therefore take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him shall [ more] be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."
42勘 8:19 And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd.
42勘 8:20 And it was reported to Him, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You."
42勘 8:21 But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."
42勘 8:22 Now it came about on one of [those] days, that He and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." And they launched out.
42勘 8:23 But as they were sailing along He fell asleep; and a fierce gale of wind descended upon the lake, and they [began] to be swamped and to be in danger.
42勘 8:24 And they came to Him and woke Him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.
42勘 8:25 And He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, "Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?"
42勘 8:26 And they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
42勘 8:27 And when He had come out onto the land, He was met by a certain man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.
42勘 8:28 And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, "What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me."
42勘 8:29 For He had been commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard; and [yet] he would burst his fetters and be driven by the demon into the desert.
42勘 8:30 And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legion"; for many demons had entered him.
42勘 8:31 And they were entreating Him not to command them to depart into the abyss.
42勘 8:32 Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain; and [the demons] entreated Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission.
42勘 8:33 And the demons came out from the man and entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
42勘 8:34 And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and [out] in the country.
42勘 8:35 And [the people] went out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they became frightened.
42勘 8:36 And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been made well.
42勘 8:37 And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to depart from them; for they were gripped with great fear; and He got into a boat, and returned.
42勘 8:38 But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him; but He sent him away, saying,
42勘 8:39 "Return to your house and describe what great things God has done for you." And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
42勘 8:40 And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.
42勘 8:41 And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet, and [began] to entreat Him to come to his house;
42勘 8:42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the multitudes were pressing against Him.
42勘 8:43 And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone,
42勘 8:44 came up behind Him, and touched the fringe of His cloak; and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.
42勘 8:45 And Jesus said, "Who is the one who touched Me?" And while they were all denying it, Peter said, "Master, the multitudes are crowding and pressing upon You."
42勘 8:46 But Jesus said, "Someone did touch Me, for I was aware that power had gone out of Me."
42勘 8:47 And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him, and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.
42勘 8:48 And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace."
42勘 8:49 While He was still speaking, someone *came from [the house of] the synagogue official, saying, "Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore."
42勘 8:50 But when Jesus heard [this,] He answered him, "Do not be afraid [any longer;] only believe, and she shall be made well."
42勘 8:51 And when He had come to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl's father and mother.
42勘 8:52 Now they were all weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, "Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep."
42勘 8:53 And they [began] laughing at Him, knowing that she had died.
42勘 8:54 He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!"
42勘 8:55 And her spirit returned, and she rose immediately; and He gave orders for [something] to be given her to eat.
42勘 8:56 And her parents were amazed; but He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
42勘 9:1 And He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases.
42勘 9:2 And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to perform healing.
42勘 9:3 And He said to them, "Take nothing for [your] journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not [even] have two tunics apiece.
42勘 9:4 "And whatever house you enter, stay there, and take your leave from there.
42勘 9:5 "And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."
42勘 9:6 And departing, they [began] going about among the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.
42勘 9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening; and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,
42勘 9:8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others, that one of the prophets of old had risen again.
42勘 9:9 And Herod said, "I myself had John beheaded; but who is this man about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see Him.
42勘 9:10 And when the apostles returned, they gave an account to Him of all that they had done. And taking them with Him, He withdrew by Himself to a city called Bethsaida.
42勘 9:11 But the multitudes were aware of this and followed Him; and welcoming them, He [began] speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing.
42勘 9:12 And the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to Him, " Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat; for here we are in a desolate place. "
42勘 9:13 But He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat!" And they said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people."
42勘 9:14 (For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, "Have them recline [to eat] in groups of about fifty each."
42勘 9:15 And they did so, and had them all recline.
42勘 9:16 And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them, and broke [them,] and kept giving [them] to the disciples to set before the multitude.
42勘 9:17 And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets [full.]
42勘 9:18 And it came about that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"
42勘 9:19 And they answered and said, "John the Baptist, and others [say] Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again."
42勘 9:20 And He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" And Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."
42勘 9:21 But He warned them, and instructed [them] not to tell this to anyone,
42勘 9:22 saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day."
42勘 9:23 And He was saying to [them] all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.
42勘 9:24 "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.
42勘 9:25 "For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?
42勘 9:26 "For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in His glory, and [the glory] of the Father and of the holy angels.
42勘 9:27 "But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
42勘 9:28 And some eight days after these sayings, it came about that He took along Peter and John and James, and went up to the mountain to pray.
42勘 9:29 And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing [became] white [and] gleaming.
42勘 9:30 And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,
42勘 9:31 who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
42勘 9:32 Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.
42勘 9:33 And it came about, as these were parting from Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah"-- not realizing what he was saying.
42勘 9:34 And while he was saying this, a cloud formed and [began] to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
42勘 9:35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My Son, [My] Chosen One; listen to Him!"
42勘 9:36 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
42勘 9:37 And it came about on the next day, that when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met Him.
42勘 9:38 And behold, a man from the multitude shouted out, saying, "Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only [boy,]
42勘 9:39 and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming [at the mouth,] and as it mauls him, it scarcely leaves him.
42勘 9:40 "And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not."
42勘 9:41 And Jesus answered and said, "O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring your son here."
42勘 9:42 And while he was still approaching, the demon dashed him [to the ground,] and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
42勘 9:43 And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples,
42勘 9:44 "Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
42勘 9:45 But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they might not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement.
42勘 9:46 And an argument arose among them as to which of them might be the greatest.
42勘 9:47 But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side,
42勘 9:48 and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is least among you, this is the one who is great."
42勘 9:49 And John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to hinder him because he does not follow along with us."
42勘 9:50 But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder [him;] for he who is not against you is for you."
42勘 9:51 And it came about, when the days were approaching for His ascension, that He resolutely set His face to go to Jerusalem;
42勘 9:52 and He sent messengers on ahead of Him. And they went, and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make arrangements for Him.
42勘 9:53 And they did not receive Him, because He was journeying with His face toward Jerusalem.
42勘 9:54 And when His disciples James and John saw [this,] they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"
42勘 9:55 But He turned and rebuked them, {and said, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are of;
42勘 9:56 for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. "}And they went on to another village.
42勘 9:57 And as they were going along the road, someone said to Him, "I will follow You wherever You go."
42勘 9:58 And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
42勘 9:59 And He said to another, "Follow Me." But he said, "Permit me first to go and bury my father."
42勘 9:60 But He said to him, "Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God."
42勘 9:61 And another also said, "I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say good-bye to those at home."
42勘 9:62 But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
42勘 10:1 Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come.
42勘 10:2 And He was saying to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
42勘 10:3 "Go your ways; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
42勘 10:4 "Carry no purse, no bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way.
42勘 10:5 "And whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace [be] to this house.'
42勘 10:6 "And if a man of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.
42勘 10:7 "And stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.
42勘 10:8 "And whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you;
42勘 10:9 and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
42勘 10:10 "But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
42勘 10:11 'Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet, we wipe off [ in protest] against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'
42勘 10:12 "I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
42勘 10:13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42勘 10:14 "But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
42勘 10:15 "And you, Capernaum, will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down to Hades!
42勘 10:16 "The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me."
42勘 10:17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."
42勘 10:18 And He said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
42勘 10:19 "Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall injure you.
42勘 10:20 "Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
42勘 10:21 At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou didst hide these things from [the] wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes. Yes, Father, for thus it was well-pleasing in Thy sight.
42勘 10:22 "All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him.]"
42勘 10:23 And turning to the disciples, He said privately, "Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things you see,
42勘 10:24 for I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see [them,] and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear [them.] "
42勘 10:25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42勘 10:26 And He said to him, "What is written in the Law? How does it read to you?"
42勘 10:27 And he answered and said, "YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
42勘 10:28 And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; DO THIS, AND YOU WILL LIVE."
42勘 10:29 But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42勘 10:30 Jesus replied and said, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went off leaving him half dead.
42勘 10:31 "And by chance a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
42勘 10:32 "And likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42勘 10:33 "But a certain Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion,
42勘 10:34 and came to him, and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on [them;] and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
42勘 10:35 "And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'
42勘 10:36 "Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers' [hands?]"
42勘 10:37 And he said, "The one who showed mercy toward him." And Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."
42勘 10:38 Now as they were traveling along, He entered a certain village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
42勘 10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, who moreover was listening to the Lord's word, seated at His feet.
42勘 10:40 But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up [to Him,] and said, "Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me."
42勘 10:41 But the Lord answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things;
42勘 10:42 but [only] a few things are necessary, really [only] one, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her. "
42勘 11:1 And it came about that while He was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples."
42勘 11:2 And He said to them, "When you pray, say 'Father, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.
42勘 11:3 'Give us each day our daily bread.
42勘 11:4 'And forgive us our sins, For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.' "
42勘 11:5 And He said to them, "Suppose one of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves;
42勘 11:6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him ';
42勘 11:7 and from inside he shall answer and say, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you [anything.]'
42勘 11:8 "I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him [anything] because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
42勘 11:9 "And I say to you, ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
42勘 11:10 "For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.
42勘 11:11 "Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
42勘 11:12 "Or [if] he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?
42勘 11:13 "If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"
42勘 11:14 And He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb; and it came about that when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.
42勘 11:15 But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
42勘 11:16 And others, to test [Him,] were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.
42勘 11:17 But He knew their thoughts, and said to them, "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house [divided] against itself falls.
42勘 11:18 "And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
42勘 11:19 "And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Consequently they shall be your judges.
42勘 11:20 "But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
42勘 11:21 "When a strong [man,] fully armed, guards his own homestead, his possessions are undisturbed;
42勘 11:22 but when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied, and distributes his plunder.
42勘 11:23 "He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me, scatters.
42勘 11:24 "When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
42勘 11:25 "And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.
42勘 11:26 "Then it goes and takes [along] seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first."
42勘 11:27 And it came about while He said these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice, and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts at which You nursed."
42勘 11:28 But He said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and observe it."
42勘 11:29 And as the crowds were increasing, He began to say, "This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks for a sign, and [yet] no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
42勘 11:30 "For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of Man be to this generation.
42勘 11:31 "The Queen of the South shall rise up with the men of this generation at the judgment and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
42勘 11:32 "The men of Nineveh shall stand up with this generation at the judgment and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
42勘 11:33 "No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar, nor under a peck-measure, but on the lampstand, in order that those who enter may see the light.
42勘 11:34 "The lamp of your body is your eye; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.
42勘 11:35 "Then watch out that the light in you may not be darkness.
42勘 11:36 "If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it shall be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays."
42勘 11:37 Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have lunch with him; and He went in, and reclined [at the table.]
42勘 11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal.
42勘 11:39 But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness.
42勘 11:40 "You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
42勘 11:41 "But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you.
42勘 11:42 "But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every [kind of] garden herb, and [yet] disregard justice and the love of God; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.
42勘 11:43 "Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the front seats in the synagogues, and the respectful greetings in the market places.
42勘 11:44 "Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over [them] are unaware [of it.]"
42勘 11:45 And one of the lawyers *said to Him in reply, "Teacher, when You say this, You insult us too."
42勘 11:46 But He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
42勘 11:47 "Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and [it was] your fathers [who] killed them.
42勘 11:48 "Consequently, you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build [their tombs.]
42勘 11:49 "For this reason also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they will kill and [some] they will persecute,
42勘 11:50 in order that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,
42勘 11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the house [of God;] yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation. '
42勘 11:52 "Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you hindered."
42勘 11:53 And when He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects,
42勘 11:54 plotting against Him, to catch [Him] in something He might say.
42勘 12:1 Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began saying to His disciples first [of all,] "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
42勘 12:2 "But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.
42勘 12:3 "Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
42勘 12:4 "And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
42勘 12:5 "But I will warn you whom to fear fear the One who after He has killed has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!
42勘 12:6 "Are not five sparrows sold for two cents? And [yet] not one of them is forgotten before God.
42勘 12:7 "Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.
42勘 12:8 "And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man shall confess him also before the angels of God;
42勘 12:9 but he who denies Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
42勘 12:10 "And everyone who will speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him.
42勘 12:11 "And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you should speak in your defense, or what you should say;
42勘 12:12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say. "
42勘 12:13 And someone in the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the [family] inheritance with me."
42勘 12:14 But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbiter over you?"
42勘 12:15 And He said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not [even] when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions."
42勘 12:16 And He told them a parable, saying, "The land of a certain rich man was very productive.
42勘 12:17 "And he began reasoning to himself, saying, 'What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?'
42勘 12:18 "And he said, 'This is what I will do I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
42勘 12:19 'And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years [to come;] take your ease, eat, drink [and] be merry."'
42勘 12:20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! This [very] night your soul is required of you; and [now] who will own what you have prepared?'
42勘 12:21 "So is the man who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
42勘 12:22 And He said to His disciples, "For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for [your] life, [as to] what you shall eat; nor for your body, [as to] what you shall put on.
42勘 12:23 "For life is more than food, and the body than clothing.
42勘 12:24 "Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; and they have no storeroom nor barn; and [yet] God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!
42勘 12:25 "And which of you by being anxious can add a [single] cubit to his life's span?
42勘 12:26 "If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why are you anxious about other matters?
42勘 12:27 "Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory did not clothe himself like one of these.
42勘 12:28 "But if God so arrays the grass in the field, which is [alive] today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more [will He clothe] you, O men of little faith!
42勘 12:29 "And do not seek what you shall eat, and what you shall drink, and do not keep worrying.
42勘 12:30 "For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things.
42勘 12:31 "But seek for His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you.
42勘 12:32 "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
42勘 12:33 "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys.
42勘 12:34 "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
42勘 12:35 "Be dressed in readiness, and [keep] your lamps alight.
42勘 12:36 "And be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open [the door] to him when he comes and knocks.
42勘 12:37 "Blessed are those slaves whom the master shall find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself [to serve,] and have them recline [at the table,] and will come up and wait on them.
42勘 12:38 "Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds [them] so, blessed are those [slaves].
42勘 12:39 "And be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
42勘 12:40 "You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect."
42勘 12:41 And Peter said, "Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone [else] as well?"
42勘 12:42 And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and sensible steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?
42勘 12:43 "Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
42勘 12:44 "Truly I say to you, that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42勘 12:45 "But if that slave says in his heart, 'My master will be a long time in coming,' and begins to beat the slaves, [both] men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk;
42勘 12:46 the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect [him,] and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42勘 12:47 "And that slave who knew his master's will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, shall receive many lashes,
42勘 12:48 but the one who did not know [it,] and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few. And from everyone who has been given much shall much be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.
42勘 12:49 "I have come to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!
42勘 12:50 "But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
42勘 12:51 "Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division;
42勘 12:52 for from now on five [members] in one household will be divided, three against two, and two against three.
42勘 12:53 "They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
42勘 12:54 And He was also saying to the multitudes, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it turns out.
42勘 12:55 "And when [you see] a south wind blowing, you say, 'It will be a hot day,' and it turns out [that way.]
42勘 12:56 "You hypocrites! You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not analyze this present time?
42勘 12:57 "And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right?
42勘 12:58 "For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on [your] way [there] make an effort to settle with him, in order that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the constable, and the constable throw you into prison.
42勘 12:59 "I say to you, you shall not get out of there until you have paid the very last cent."
42勘 13:1 Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
42勘 13:2 And He answered and said to them, "Do you suppose that these Galileans were [greater] sinners than all [other] Galileans, because they suffered this [fate?]
42勘 13:3 "I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
42勘 13:4 "Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, were [worse] culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem?
42勘 13:5 "I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
42勘 13:6 And He [began] telling this parable "A certain man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it, and did not find any.
42勘 13:7 "And he said to the vineyard-keeper, 'Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?'
42勘 13:8 "And he answered and said to him, 'Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;
42勘 13:9 and if it bears fruit next year, [fine;] but if not, cut it down. ' "
42勘 13:10 And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
42勘 13:11 And behold, there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all.
42勘 13:12 And when Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your sickness."
42勘 13:13 And He laid His hands upon her; and immediately she was made erect again, and [began] glorifying God.
42勘 13:14 And the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, [began] saying to the multitude in response, "There are six days in which work should be done; therefore come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day."
42勘 13:15 But the Lord answered him and said, "You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead him away to water [him?]
42勘 13:16 "And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?"
42勘 13:17 And as He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire multitude was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.
42勘 13:18 Therefore He was saying, "What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?
42勘 13:19 "It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree; and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES."
42勘 13:20 And again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
42勘 13:21 "It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three pecks of meal, until it was all leavened."
42勘 13:22 And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem.
42勘 13:23 And someone said to Him, "Lord, are there [just] a few who are being saved?" And He said to them,
42勘 13:24 "Strive to enter by the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
42勘 13:25 "Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up to us!' then He will answer and say to you,' I do not know where you are from. '
42勘 13:26 "Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets';
42勘 13:27 and He will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU EVILDOERS.'
42勘 13:28 "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth there when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being cast out.
42勘 13:29 "And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline [at the table] in the kingdom of God.
42勘 13:30 "And behold, [some] are last who will be first and [some] are first who will be last."
42勘 13:31 Just at that time some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, "Go away and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You."
42勘 13:32 And He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I reach My goal.'
42勘 13:33 "Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next [day;] for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.
42勘 13:34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [the city] that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen [gathers] her brood under her wings, and you would not [have it!]
42勘 13:35 "Behold, your house is left to you [desolate;] and I say to you, you shall not see Me until [the time] comes when you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'"
42勘 14:1 And it came about when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on [the] Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching Him closely.
42勘 14:2 And there, in front of Him was a certain man suffering from dropsy.
42勘 14:3 And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not? "
42勘 14:4 But they kept silent. And He took hold of him, and healed him, and sent him away.
42勘 14:5 And He said to them, "Which one of you shall have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"
42勘 14:6 And they could make no reply to this.
42勘 14:7 And He [began] speaking a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honor [at the table;] saying to them,
42勘 14:8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,
42勘 14:9 and he who invited you both shall come and say to you, 'Give place to this man,' and then in disgrace you proceed to occupy the last place.
42勘 14:10 "But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'; then you will have honor in the sight of all who are at the table with you.
42勘 14:11 "For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."
42勘 14:12 And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and repayment come to you.
42勘 14:13 "But when you give a reception, invite [the] poor, [the] crippled, [ the] lame, [the] blind,
42勘 14:14 and you will be blessed, since they do not have [the means] to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. "
42勘 14:15 And when one of those who were reclining [at the table] with Him heard this, he said to Him, "Blessed is everyone who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
42勘 14:16 But He said to him, "A certain man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many;
42勘 14:17 and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, 'Come; for everything is ready now.'
42勘 14:18 "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, 'I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it; please consider me excused.'
42勘 14:19 "And another one said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.'
42勘 14:20 "And another one said, 'I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.'
42勘 14:21 "And the slave came [back] and reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, 'Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.'
42勘 14:22 "And the slave said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'
42勘 14:23 "And the master said to the slave, 'Go out into the highways and along the hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that my house may be filled.
42勘 14:24 'For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.' "
42勘 14:25 Now great multitudes were going along with Him; and He turned and said to them,
42勘 14:26 "If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.
42勘 14:27 "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
42勘 14:28 "For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?
42勘 14:29 "Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him,
42勘 14:30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
42勘 14:31 "Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and take counsel whether he is strong enough with ten thousand [men] to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
42勘 14:32 "Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace.
42勘 14:33 "So therefore, no one of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions.
42勘 14:34 "Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?
42勘 14:35 "It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
42勘 15:1 Now all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.
42勘 15:2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes [began] to grumble, saying, " This man receives sinners and eats with them. "
42勘 15:3 And He told them this parable, saying,
42勘 15:4 "What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture, and go after the one which is lost, until he finds it?
42勘 15:5 "And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
42勘 15:6 "And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
42勘 15:7 "I tell you that in the same way, there will be [more] joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.
42勘 15:8 "Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
42勘 15:9 "And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!'
42勘 15:10 "In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
42勘 15:11 And He said, "A certain man had two sons;
42勘 15:12 and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.' And he divided his wealth between them.
42勘 15:13 "And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.
42勘 15:14 "Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be in need.
42勘 15:15 "And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
42勘 15:16 "And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving [anything] to him.
42勘 15:17 "But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!
42勘 15:18 'I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;
42勘 15:19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men. "'
42勘 15:20 "And he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him, and felt compassion [for him,] and ran and embraced him, and kissed him.
42勘 15:21 "And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
42勘 15:22 "But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;
42勘 15:23 and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
42勘 15:24 for this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found. 'And they began to be merry.
42勘 15:25 "Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
42勘 15:26 "And he summoned one of the servants and [began] inquiring what these things might be.
42勘 15:27 "And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'
42勘 15:28 "But he became angry, and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and [began] entreating him.
42勘 15:29 "But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you, and I have never neglected a command of yours; and [ yet] you have never given me a kid, that I might be merry with my friends;
42勘 15:30 but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with harlots, you killed the fattened calf for him. '
42勘 15:31 "And he said to him, ['My] child, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours.
42勘 15:32 'But we had to be merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and [has begun] to live, and [was] lost and has been found.' "
42勘 16:1 Now He was also saying to the disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this [steward] was reported to him as squandering his possessions.
42勘 16:2 "And he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.'
42勘 16:3 "And the steward said to himself, 'What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
42勘 16:4 'I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, they will receive me into their homes.'
42勘 16:5 "And he summoned each one of his master's debtors, and he [began] saying to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
42勘 16:6 "And he said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
42勘 16:7 "Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, ' A hundred measures of wheat. 'He *said to him,' Take your bill, and write eighty. '
42勘 16:8 "And his master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light.
42勘 16:9 "And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.
42勘 16:10 "He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.
42勘 16:11 "If therefore you have not been faithful in the [use of] unrighteous mammon, who will entrust the true [riches] to you?
42勘 16:12 "And if you have not been faithful in [the use of] that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
42勘 16:13 "No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."
42勘 16:14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things, and they were scoffing at Him.
42勘 16:15 And He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God.
42勘 16:16 "The Law and the Prophets [were proclaimed] until John; since then the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
42勘 16:17 "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.
42勘 16:18 "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.
42勘 16:19 "Now there was a certain rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, gaily living in splendor every day.
42勘 16:20 "And a certain poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,
42勘 16:21 and longing to be fed with the [crumbs] which were falling from the rich man's table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
42勘 16:22 "Now it came about that the poor man died and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.
42勘 16:23 "And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom.
42勘 16:24 "And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.'
42勘 16:25 "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony.
42勘 16:26 'And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, in order that those who wish to come over from here to you may not be able, and [that] none may cross over from there to us.'
42勘 16:27 "And he said, 'Then I beg you, Father, that you send him to my father's house--
42勘 16:28 for I have five brothers-- that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment. '
42勘 16:29 "But Abraham *said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.'
42勘 16:30 "But he said, 'No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!'
42勘 16:31 "But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.'"
42勘 17:1 And He said to His disciples, "It is inevitable that stumbling blocks should come, but woe to him through whom they come!
42勘 17:2 "It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
42勘 17:3 "Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
42勘 17:4 "And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' forgive him."
42勘 17:5 And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
42勘 17:6 And the Lord said, "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea'; and it would obey you.
42勘 17:7 "But which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down to eat'?
42勘 17:8 "But will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and [ properly] clothe yourself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk; and afterward you will eat and drink'?
42勘 17:9 "He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he?
42勘 17:10 "So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy slaves; we have done [only] that which we ought to have done.'"
42勘 17:11 And it came about while He was on the way to Jerusalem, that He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
42勘 17:12 And as He entered a certain village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him;
42勘 17:13 and they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42勘 17:14 And when He saw them, He said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And it came about that as they were going, they were cleansed.
42勘 17:15 Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,
42勘 17:16 and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan.
42勘 17:17 And Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine-- where are they?
42勘 17:18 "Was no one found who turned back to give glory to God, except this foreigner?"
42勘 17:19 And He said to him, "Rise, and go your way; your faith has made you well."
42勘 17:20 Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed;
42勘 17:21 nor will they say, 'Look, here [it is!]' or, 'There [it is!]' For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst. "
42勘 17:22 And He said to the disciples, "The days shall come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
42勘 17:23 "And they will say to you, 'Look there! Look here!' Do not go away, and do not run after [them.]
42勘 17:24 "For just as the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day.
42勘 17:25 "But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42勘 17:26 "And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it shall be also in the days of the Son of Man
42勘 17:27 they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
42勘 17:28 "It was the same as happened in the days of Lot they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
42勘 17:29 but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
42勘 17:30 "It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
42勘 17:31 "On that day, let not the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house go down to take them away; and likewise let not the one who is in the field turn back.
42勘 17:32 "Remember Lot's wife.
42勘 17:33 "Whoever seeks to keep his life shall lose it, and whoever loses [ his life] shall preserve it.
42勘 17:34 "I tell you, on that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken, and the other will be left.
42勘 17:35 "There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken, and the other will be left.
42勘 17:36 {"Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left."}
42勘 17:37 And answering they *said to Him, "Where, Lord?" And He said to them, "Where the body [is,] there also will the vultures be gathered."
42勘 18:1 Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart,
42勘 18:2 saying, "There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God, and did not respect man.
42勘 18:3 "And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Give me legal protection from my opponent.'
42勘 18:4 "And for a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, 'Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,
42勘 18:5 yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, lest by continually coming she wear me out. '"
42勘 18:6 And the Lord said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge *said;
42勘 18:7 now shall not God bring about justice for His elect, who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?
42勘 18:8 "I tell you that He will bring about justice for them speedily. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?"
42勘 18:9 And He also told this parable to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt
42勘 18:10 "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.
42勘 18:11 "The Pharisee stood and was praying thus to himself, 'God, I thank Thee that I am not like other people swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax-gatherer.
42勘 18:12 'I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.'
42勘 18:13 "But the tax-gatherer, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ' God, be merciful to me, the sinner! '
42勘 18:14 "I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."
42勘 18:15 And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they [began] rebuking them.
42勘 18:16 But Jesus called for them, saying, "Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42勘 18:17 "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it [at all.]"
42勘 18:18 And a certain ruler questioned Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42勘 18:19 And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.
42勘 18:20 "You know the commandments, 'DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.'"
42勘 18:21 And he said, "All these things I have kept from [my] youth."
42勘 18:22 And when Jesus heard [this,] He said to him, "One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess, and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
42勘 18:23 But when he had heard these things, he became very sad; for he was extremely rich.
42勘 18:24 And Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!
42勘 18:25 "For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
42勘 18:26 And they who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
42勘 18:27 But He said, "The things impossible with men are possible with God."
42勘 18:28 And Peter said, "Behold, we have left our own [homes,] and followed You."
42勘 18:29 And He said to them, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
42勘 18:30 who shall not receive many times as much at this time and in the age to come, eternal life. "
42勘 18:31 And He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
42勘 18:32 "For He will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon,
42勘 18:33 and after they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and the third day He will rise again. "
42勘 18:34 And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.
42勘 18:35 And it came about that as He was approaching Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging.
42勘 18:36 Now hearing a multitude going by, he [began] to inquire what this might be.
42勘 18:37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
42勘 18:38 And he called out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42勘 18:39 And those who led the way were sternly telling him to be quiet; but he kept crying out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42勘 18:40 And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him; and when he had come near, He questioned him,
42勘 18:41 "What do you want Me to do for you?" And he said, "Lord, [I want] to regain my sight!"
42勘 18:42 And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well."
42勘 18:43 And immediately he regained his sight, and [began] following Him, glorifying God; and when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God.
42勘 19:1 And He entered and was passing through Jericho.
42勘 19:2 And behold, there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich.
42勘 19:3 And he was trying to see who Jesus was, and he was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
42勘 19:4 And he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.
42勘 19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, "Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
42勘 19:6 And he hurried and came down, and received Him gladly.
42勘 19:7 And when they saw it, they all [began] to grumble, saying, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."
42勘 19:8 And Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much."
42勘 19:9 And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham.
42勘 19:10 "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."
42勘 19:11 And while they were listening to these things, He went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
42勘 19:12 He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and [then] return.
42勘 19:13 "And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business [with this] until I come [back.]'
42勘 19:14 "But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
42勘 19:15 "And it came about that when he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him in order that he might know what business they had done.
42勘 19:16 "And the first appeared, saying, 'Master, your mina has made ten minas more.'
42勘 19:17 "And he said to him, 'Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, be in authority over ten cities.'
42勘 19:18 "And the second came, saying, 'Your mina, master, has made five minas.'
42勘 19:19 "And he said to him also, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
42勘 19:20 "And another came, saying, 'Master, behold your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;
42勘 19:21 for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow. '
42勘 19:22 "He *said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow?
42勘 19:23 'Then why did you not put the money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?'
42勘 19:24 "And he said to the bystanders, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.'
42勘 19:25 "And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas [already.]'
42勘 19:26 "I tell you, that to everyone who has shall [more] be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.
42勘 19:27 "But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence."
42勘 19:28 And after He had said these things, He was going on ahead, ascending to Jerusalem.
42勘 19:29 And it came about that when He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount that is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,
42勘 19:30 saying, "Go into the village opposite [you,] in which as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it, and bring it [here.]
42勘 19:31 "And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' thus shall you speak, 'The Lord has need of it.'"
42勘 19:32 And those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them.
42勘 19:33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
42勘 19:34 And they said, "The Lord has need of it."
42勘 19:35 And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt, and put Jesus [on it.]
42勘 19:36 And as He was going, they were spreading their garments in the road.
42勘 19:37 And as He was now approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,
42勘 19:38 saying, "BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
42勘 19:39 And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."
42勘 19:40 And He answered and said, "I tell you, if these become silent, the stones will cry out!"
42勘 19:41 And when He approached, He saw the city and wept over it,
42勘 19:42 saying, "If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.
42勘 19:43 "For the days shall come upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank before you, and surround you, and hem you in on every side,
42勘 19:44 and will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation. "
42勘 19:45 And He entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,
42勘 19:46 saying to them, "It is written, 'AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,' but you have made it a Robbers' DEN."
42勘 19:47 And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him,
42勘 19:48 and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging upon His words.
42勘 20:1 And it came about on one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, that the chief priests and the scribes with the elders confronted [Him,]
42勘 20:2 and they spoke, saying to Him, "Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?"
42勘 20:3 And He answered and said to them, "I shall also ask you a question, and you tell Me
42勘 20:4 "Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"
42勘 20:5 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'
42勘 20:6 "But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet."
42勘 20:7 And they answered that they did not know where [it came] from.
42勘 20:8 And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
42勘 20:9 And He began to tell the people this parable "A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time.
42勘 20:10 "And at the [harvest] time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order that they might give him [some] of the produce of the vineyard; but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
42勘 20:11 "And he proceeded to send another slave; and they beat him also and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
42勘 20:12 "And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out.
42勘 20:13 "And the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'
42勘 20:14 "But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, 'This is the heir; let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours.'
42勘 20:15 "And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42勘 20:16 "He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others." And when they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"
42勘 20:17 But He looked at them and said, "What then is this that is written, 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER [stone]'?
42勘 20:18 "Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust."
42勘 20:19 And the scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, and they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them.
42勘 20:20 And they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order that they might catch Him in some statement, so as to deliver Him up to the rule and the authority of the governor.
42勘 20:21 And they questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth.
42勘 20:22 "Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
42勘 20:23 But He detected their trickery and said to them,
42勘 20:24 "Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?" And they said," Caesar's. "
42勘 20:25 And He said to them, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
42勘 20:26 And they were unable to catch Him in a saying in the presence of the people; and marveling at His answer, they became silent.
42勘 20:27 Now there came to Him some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection),
42勘 20:28 and they questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A Man's BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD TAKE THE WIFE AND RAISE UP OFFSPRING TO HIS BROTHER.
42勘 20:29 "Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died childless;
42勘 20:30 and the second
42勘 20:31 and the third took her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.
42勘 20:32 "Finally the woman died also.
42勘 20:33 "In the resurrection therefore, which one's wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife."
42勘 20:34 And Jesus said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
42勘 20:35 but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;
42勘 20:36 for neither can they die anymore, for they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
42勘 20:37 "But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the [passage about the burning] bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB.
42勘 20:38 "Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him."
42勘 20:39 And some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."
42勘 20:40 For they did not have courage to question Him any longer about anything.
42勘 20:41 And He said to them, "How [is it that] they say the Christ is David's son?
42勘 20:42 "For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD," SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
42勘 20:43 UNTIL I MAKE THINE ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR THY FEET. "'
42勘 20:44 "David therefore calls Him 'Lord,' and how is He his son?"
42勘 20:45 And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,
42勘 20:46 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love respectful greetings in the market places, and chief seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at banquets,
42勘 20:47 who devour widows' houses, and for appearance's sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation. "
42勘 21:1 And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
42勘 21:2 And He saw a certain poor widow putting in two small copper coins.
42勘 21:3 And He said, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all [of them;]
42勘 21:4 for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on. "
42勘 21:5 And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said,
42勘 21:6 "[As for] these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down."
42勘 21:7 And they questioned Him, saying, "Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what [will be] the sign when these things are about to take place?"
42勘 21:8 And He said, "See to it that you be not misled; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am [He,'] and, 'The time is at hand'; do not go after them.
42勘 21:9 "And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end [does] not [follow] immediately."
42勘 21:10 Then He continued by saying to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,
42勘 21:11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places plagues and famines; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
42勘 21:12 "But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name's sake.
42勘 21:13 "It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.
42勘 21:14 "So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves;
42勘 21:15 for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.
42勘 21:16 "But you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put [some] of you to death,
42勘 21:17 and you will be hated by all on account of My name.
42勘 21:18 "Yet not a hair of your head will perish.
42勘 21:19 "By your endurance you will gain your lives.
42勘 21:20 "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is at hand.
42勘 21:21 "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of the city depart, and let not those who are in the country enter the city;
42勘 21:22 because these are days of vengeance, in order that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
42勘 21:23 "Woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people,
42勘 21:24 and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
42勘 21:25 "And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,
42勘 21:26 men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
42勘 21:27 "And then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory.
42勘 21:28 "But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
42勘 21:29 And He told them a parable "Behold the fig tree and all the trees;
42勘 21:30 as soon as they put forth [leaves,] you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near.
42勘 21:31 "Even so you, too, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near.
42勘 21:32 "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place.
42勘 21:33 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
42勘 21:34 "Be on guard, that your hearts may not be weighted down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day come on you suddenly like a trap;
42勘 21:35 for it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth.
42勘 21:36 "But keep on the alert at all times, praying in order that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."
42勘 21:37 Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet.
42勘 21:38 And all the people would get up early in the morning [to come] to Him in the temple to listen to Him.
42勘 22:1 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
42勘 22:2 And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
42勘 22:3 And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the twelve.
42勘 22:4 And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them.
42勘 22:5 And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
42勘 22:6 And he consented, and [began] seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the multitude.
42勘 22:7 Then came the [first] day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be sacrificed.
42勘 22:8 And He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."
42勘 22:9 And they said to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare it?"
42勘 22:10 And He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters.
42勘 22:11 "And you shall say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says to you," Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples? "'
42勘 22:12 "And he will show you a large, furnished, upper room; prepare it there."
42勘 22:13 And they departed and found [everything] just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
42勘 22:14 And when the hour had come He reclined [at the table,] and the apostles with Him.
42勘 22:15 And He said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
42勘 22:16 for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. "
42勘 22:17 And when He had taken a cup [and] given thanks, He said, "Take this and share it among yourselves;
42勘 22:18 for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes. "
42勘 22:19 And when He had taken [some] bread [and] given thanks, He broke [it,] and gave [it] to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."
42勘 22:20 And in the same way [He took] the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood.
42勘 22:21 "But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me on the table.
42勘 22:22 "For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!"
42勘 22:23 And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.
42勘 22:24 And there arose also a dispute among them [as to] which one of them was regarded to be greatest.
42勘 22:25 And He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called 'Benefactors.'
42勘 22:26 "But not so with you, but let him who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.
42勘 22:27 "For who is greater, the one who reclines [at the table,] or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines [at the table]? But I am among you as the one who serves.
42勘 22:28 "And you are those who have stood by Me in My trials;
42勘 22:29 and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you
42勘 22:30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42勘 22:31 "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded [permission] to sift you like wheat;
42勘 22:32 but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers. "
42勘 22:33 And he said to Him, "Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!"
42勘 22:34 And He said, "I say to you, Peter, the cock will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me."
42勘 22:35 And He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" And they said, "[No,] nothing."
42勘 22:36 And He said to them, "But now, let him who has a purse take it along, likewise also a bag, and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one.
42勘 22:37 "For I tell you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, 'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS'; for that which refers to Me has [its] fulfillment."
42勘 22:38 And they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He said to them, "It is enough."
42勘 22:39 And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.
42勘 22:40 And when He arrived at the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
42勘 22:41 And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and [began] to pray,
42勘 22:42 saying, "Father, if Thou art willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Thine be done."
42勘 22:43 Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
42勘 22:44 And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.
42勘 22:45 And when He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow,
42勘 22:46 and said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
42勘 22:47 While He was still speaking, behold, a multitude [came,] and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was preceding them; and he approached Jesus to kiss Him.
42勘 22:48 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42勘 22:49 And when those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
42勘 22:50 And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
42勘 22:51 But Jesus answered and said, "Stop! No more of this." And He touched his ear and healed him.
42勘 22:52 And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?
42勘 22:53 "While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power of darkness are yours."
42勘 22:54 And having arrested Him, they led Him [away,] and brought Him to the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance.
42勘 22:55 And after they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.
42勘 22:56 And a certain servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, and looking intently at him, said, "This man was with Him too."
42勘 22:57 But he denied [it,] saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."
42勘 22:58 And a little later, another saw him and said, "You are [one] of them too!" But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"
42勘 22:59 And after about an hour had passed, another man [began] to insist, saying, "Certainly this man also was with Him, for he is a Galilean too."
42勘 22:60 But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." And immediately, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.
42勘 22:61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, "Before a cock crows today, you will deny Me three times."
42勘 22:62 And he went out and wept bitterly.
42勘 22:63 And the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him, and beating Him,
42勘 22:64 and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, "Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?"
42勘 22:65 And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming.
42勘 22:66 And when it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their council [chamber,] saying,
42勘 22:67 "If You are the Christ, tell us." But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe;
42勘 22:68 and if I ask a question, you will not answer.
42勘 22:69 "But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD. "
42勘 22:70 And they all said, "Are You the Son of God, then?" And He said to them, "Yes, I am."
42勘 22:71 And they said, "What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth."
42勘 23:1 Then the whole body of them arose and brought Him before Pilate.
42勘 23:2 And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."
42勘 23:3 And Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" And He answered him and said, "[It is as] you say."
42勘 23:4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no guilt in this man."
42勘 23:5 But they kept on insisting, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee, even as far as this place."
42勘 23:6 But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
42勘 23:7 And when he learned that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem at that time.
42勘 23:8 Now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him.
42勘 23:9 And he questioned Him at some length; but He answered him nothing.
42勘 23:10 And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, accusing Him vehemently.
42勘 23:11 And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a gorgeous robe and sent Him back to Pilate.
42勘 23:12 Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been at enmity with each other.
42勘 23:13 And Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
42勘 23:14 and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found no guilt in this man regarding the charges which you make against Him.
42勘 23:15 "No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him.
42勘 23:16 "I will therefore punish Him and release Him."
42勘 23:17 {Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.}
42勘 23:18 But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!"
42勘 23:19 (He was one who had been thrown into prison for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder.)
42勘 23:20 And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,
42勘 23:21 but they kept on calling out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"
42勘 23:22 And he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt [demanding] death; I will therefore punish Him and release Him."
42勘 23:23 But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices [began] to prevail.
42勘 23:24 And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand should be granted.
42勘 23:25 And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will.
42勘 23:26 And when they led Him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus.
42勘 23:27 And there were following Him a great multitude of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him.
42勘 23:28 But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
42勘 23:29 "For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
42勘 23:30 "Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, 'FALL ON US,' AND TO THE HILLS, 'COVER US.'
42勘 23:31 "For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"
42勘 23:32 And two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him.
42勘 23:33 And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
42勘 23:34 But Jesus was saying, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots, dividing up His garments among themselves.
42勘 23:35 And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were sneering at Him, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One."
42勘 23:36 And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine,
42勘 23:37 and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
42勘 23:38 Now there was also an inscription above Him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42勘 23:39 And one of the criminals who were hanged [there] was hurling abuse at Him, saying, "Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!"
42勘 23:40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
42勘 23:41 "And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."
42勘 23:42 And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!"
42勘 23:43 And He said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."
42勘 23:44 And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,
42勘 23:45 the sun being obscured; and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
42勘 23:46 And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, INTO THY HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT." And having said this, He breathed His last.
42勘 23:47 Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he [began] praising God, saying, "Certainly this man was innocent."
42勘 23:48 And all the multitudes who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, [began] to return, beating their breasts.
42勘 23:49 And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, were standing at a distance, seeing these things.
42勘 23:50 And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, a good and righteous man
42勘 23:51 (he had not consented to their plan and action), [a man] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God;
42勘 23:52 this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
42勘 23:53 And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain.
42勘 23:54 And it was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42勘 23:55 Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.
42勘 23:56 And they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
42勘 24:1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
42勘 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
42勘 24:3 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42勘 24:4 And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling apparel;
42勘 24:5 and as [the women] were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, [the men] said to them, "Why do you seek the living One among the dead?
42勘 24:6 "He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,
42勘 24:7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. "
42勘 24:8 And they remembered His words,
42勘 24:9 and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
42勘 24:10 Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the [mother] of James; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.
42勘 24:11 And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe them.
42勘 24:12 {But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he * saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at that which had happened.}
42勘 24:13 And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42勘 24:14 And they were conversing with each other about all these things which had taken place.
42勘 24:15 And it came about that while they were conversing and discussing, Jesus Himself approached, and [began] traveling with them.
42勘 24:16 But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.
42勘 24:17 And He said to them, "What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?" And they stood still, looking sad.
42勘 24:18 And one of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, "Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?"
42勘 24:19 And He said to them, "What things?" And they said to Him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,
42勘 24:20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and crucified Him.
42勘 24:21 "But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.
42勘 24:22 "But also some women among us amazed us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,
42勘 24:23 and did not find His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.
42勘 24:24 "And some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also had said; but Him they did not see."
42勘 24:25 And He said to them, "O foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
42勘 24:26 "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?"
42勘 24:27 And beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.
42勘 24:28 And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.
42勘 24:29 And they urged Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is [getting] toward evening, and the day is now nearly over." And He went in to stay with them.
42勘 24:30 And it came about that when He had reclined [at the table] with them, He took the bread and blessed [it,] and breaking [it,] He [began] giving [it] to them.
42勘 24:31 And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.
42勘 24:32 And they said to one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?"
42勘 24:33 And they arose that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them,
42勘 24:34 saying, "The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to Simon."
42勘 24:35 And they [began] to relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
42勘 24:36 And while they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst.
42勘 24:37 But they were startled and frightened and thought that they were seeing a spirit.
42勘 24:38 And He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
42勘 24:39 "See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."
42勘 24:40 {And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.}
42勘 24:41 And while they still could not believe [it] for joy and were marveling, He said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
42勘 24:42 And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish;
42勘 24:43 and He took it and ate [it] before them.
42勘 24:44 Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
42勘 24:45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
42勘 24:46 and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day;
42勘 24:47 and that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
42勘 24:48 "You are witnesses of these things.
42勘 24:49 "And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
42勘 24:50 And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
42勘 24:51 And it came about that while He was blessing them, He parted from them.
42勘 24:52 And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
42勘 24:53 and were continually in the temple, praising God.

43推 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43推 1:2 He was in the beginning with God.
43推 1:3 All things came into being by Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.
43推 1:4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
43推 1:5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
43推 1:6 There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
43推 1:7 He came for a witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
43推 1:8 He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.
43推 1:9 There was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.
43推 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.
43推 1:11 He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.
43推 1:12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, [even] to those who believe in His name,
43推 1:13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
43推 1:14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43推 1:15 John *bore witness of Him, and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'"
43推 1:16 For of His fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
43推 1:17 For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.
43推 1:18 No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained [Him.]
43推 1:19 And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
43推 1:20 And he confessed, and did not deny, and he confessed, "I am not the Christ."
43推 1:21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he *said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No."
43推 1:22 They said then to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
43推 1:23 He said, "I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, 'MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
43推 1:24 Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
43推 1:25 And they asked him, and said to him, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
43推 1:26 John answered them saying, "I baptize in water, [but] among you stands One whom you do not know.
43推 1:27 "[It is] He who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
43推 1:28 These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43推 1:29 The next day he *saw Jesus coming to him, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
43推 1:30 "This is He on behalf of whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'
43推 1:31 "And I did not recognize Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water."
43推 1:32 And John bore witness saying, "I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.
43推 1:33 "And I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the one who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
43推 1:34 "And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."
43推 1:35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
43推 1:36 and he looked upon Jesus as He walked, and *said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
43推 1:37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
43推 1:38 And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and *said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to Him, "Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?"
43推 1:39 He *said to them, "Come, and you will see." They came therefore and saw where He was staying; and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
43推 1:40 One of the two who heard John [speak,] and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
43推 1:41 He *found first his own brother Simon, and *said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated means Christ).
43推 1:42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (which is translated Peter).
43推 1:43 The next day He purposed to go forth into Galilee, and He *found Philip. And Jesus *said to him, "Follow Me."
43推 1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
43推 1:45 Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and [also] the Prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43推 1:46 And Nathanael *said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see."
43推 1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
43推 1:48 Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
43推 1:49 Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."
43推 1:50 Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these."
43推 1:51 And He *said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43推 2:1 And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;
43推 2:2 and Jesus also was invited, and His disciples, to the wedding.
43推 2:3 And when the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him, "They have no wine."
43推 2:4 And Jesus *said to her, "Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not yet come."
43推 2:5 His mother *said to the servants, "Whatever He says to you, do it."
43推 2:6 Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each.
43推 2:7 Jesus *said to them, "Fill the waterpots with water." And they filled them up to the brim.
43推 2:8 And He *said to them, "Draw [some] out now, and take it to the headwaiter." And they took it [to him.]
43推 2:9 And when the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter *called the bridegroom,
43推 2:10 and *said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when [ men] have drunk freely, [then] that which is poorer; you have kept the good wine until now."
43推 2:11 This beginning of [His] signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.
43推 2:12 After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother, and [His] brothers, and His disciples; and there they stayed a few days.
43推 2:13 And the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43推 2:14 And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers seated.
43推 2:15 And He made a scourge of cords, and drove [them] all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and overturned their tables;
43推 2:16 and to those who were selling the doves He said, "Take these things away; stop making My Father's house a house of merchandise."
43推 2:17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "ZEAL FOR THY HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME."
43推 2:18 The Jews therefore answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us, seeing that You do these things?"
43推 2:19 Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43推 2:20 The Jews therefore said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"
43推 2:21 But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
43推 2:22 When therefore He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.
43推 2:23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His signs which He was doing.
43推 2:24 But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men,
43推 2:25 and because He did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man for He Himself knew what was in man.
43推 3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
43推 3:2 this man came to Him by night, and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God [as] a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."
43推 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
43推 3:4 Nicodemus *said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?"
43推 3:5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
43推 3:6 "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
43推 3:7 "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
43推 3:8 "The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
43推 3:9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
43推 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?
43推 3:11 "Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and you do not receive our witness.
43推 3:12 "If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
43推 3:13 "And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven, [even] the Son of Man.
43推 3:14 "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up;
43推 3:15 that whoever believes may in Him have eternal life.
43推 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.
43推 3:17 "For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through Him.
43推 3:18 "He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
43推 3:19 "And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their deeds were evil.
43推 3:20 "For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
43推 3:21 "But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God."
43推 3:22 After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He was spending time with them and baptizing.
43推 3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they were coming and were being baptized.
43推 3:24 For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
43推 3:25 There arose therefore a discussion on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification.
43推 3:26 And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have borne witness, behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him."
43推 3:27 John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.
43推 3:28 "You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but,' I have been sent before Him. '
43推 3:29 "He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. And so this joy of mine has been made full.
43推 3:30 "He must increase, but I must decrease.
43推 3:31 "He who comes from above is above all, he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
43推 3:32 "What He has seen and heard, of that He bears witness; and no man receives His witness.
43推 3:33 "He who has received His witness has set his seal to [this,] that God is true.
43推 3:34 "For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He gives the Spirit without measure.
43推 3:35 "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.
43推 3:36 "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."
43推 4:1 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
43推 4:2 (although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were),
43推 4:3 He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
43推 4:4 And He had to pass through Samaria.
43推 4:5 So He *came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph;
43推 4:6 and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
43推 4:7 There *came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus *said to her, "Give Me a drink."
43推 4:8 For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
43推 4:9 The Samaritan woman therefore *said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
43推 4:10 Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."
43推 4:11 She *said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water?
43推 4:12 "You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?"
43推 4:13 Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again;
43推 4:14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life. "
43推 4:15 The woman *said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so I will not be thirsty, nor come all the way here to draw."
43推 4:16 He *said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
43推 4:17 The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus *said to her, "You have well said, 'I have no husband';
43推 4:18 for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly. "
43推 4:19 The woman *said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
43推 4:20 "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you [people] say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
43推 4:21 Jesus *said to her, "Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you worship the Father.
43推 4:22 "You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
43推 4:23 "But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.
43推 4:24 "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."
43推 4:25 The woman *said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when that One comes, He will declare all things to us."
43推 4:26 Jesus *said to her, "I who speak to you am [He."]
43推 4:27 And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He had been speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What do You seek?" or, "Why do You speak with her?"
43推 4:28 So the woman left her waterpot, and went into the city, and *said to the men,
43推 4:29 "Come, see a man who told me all the things that I [have] done; this is not the Christ, is it?"
43推 4:30 They went out of the city, and were coming to Him.
43推 4:31 In the meanwhile the disciples were requesting Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
43推 4:32 But He said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."
43推 4:33 The disciples therefore were saying to one another, "No one brought Him [anything] to eat, did he?"
43推 4:34 Jesus *said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.
43推 4:35 "Do you not say, 'There are yet four months, and [then] comes the harvest'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.
43推 4:36 "Already he who reaps is receiving wages, and is gathering fruit for life eternal; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
43推 4:37 "For in this [case] the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
43推 4:38 "I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
43推 4:39 And from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, "He told me all the things that I [have] done."
43推 4:40 So when the Samaritans came to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
43推 4:41 And many more believed because of His word;
43推 4:42 and they were saying to the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the world."
43推 4:43 And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee.
43推 4:44 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
43推 4:45 So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also went to the feast.
43推 4:46 He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
43推 4:47 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him, and was requesting [Him] to come down and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
43推 4:48 Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you [people] see signs and wonders, you [simply] will not believe."
43推 4:49 The royal official *said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
43推 4:50 Jesus *said to him, "Go your way; your son lives." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he started off.
43推 4:51 And as he was now going down, [his] slaves met him, saying that his son was living.
43推 4:52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
43推 4:53 So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives"; and he himself believed, and his whole household.
43推 4:54 This is again a second sign that Jesus performed, when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
43推 5:1 After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43推 5:2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
43推 5:3 In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, {waiting for the moving of the waters;
43推 5:4 for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was made well from whatever disease with which he was afflicted.}
43推 5:5 And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.
43推 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time [in that condition,] He *said to him, "Do you wish to get well?"
43推 5:7 The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
43推 5:8 Jesus *said to him, "Arise, take up your pallet, and walk."
43推 5:9 And immediately the man became well, and took up his pallet and [began] to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
43推 5:10 Therefore the Jews were saying to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet."
43推 5:11 But he answered them, "He who made me well was the one who said to me, 'Take up your pallet and walk.'"
43推 5:12 They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up [your pallet,] and walk'?"
43推 5:13 But he who was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in [that] place.
43推 5:14 Afterward Jesus *found him in the temple, and said to him, "Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse may befall you."
43推 5:15 The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43推 5:16 And for this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
43推 5:17 But He answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I Myself am working."
43推 5:18 For this cause therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
43推 5:19 Jesus therefore answered and was saying to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless [it is] something He sees the Father doing; for whatever [the Father] does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
43推 5:20 "For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these will He show Him, that you may marvel.
43推 5:21 "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.
43推 5:22 "For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,
43推 5:23 in order that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
43推 5:24 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
43推 5:25 "Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear shall live.
43推 5:26 "For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;
43推 5:27 and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is [the] Son of Man.
43推 5:28 "Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice,
43推 5:29 and shall come forth; those who did the good [deeds] to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil [deeds] to a resurrection of judgment.
43推 5:30 "I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
43推 5:31 "If I [alone] bear witness of Myself, My testimony is not true.
43推 5:32 "There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the testimony which He bears of Me is true.
43推 5:33 "You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
43推 5:34 "But the witness which I receive is not from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.
43推 5:35 "He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
43推 5:36 "But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.
43推 5:37 "And the Father who sent Me, He has borne witness of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.
43推 5:38 "And you do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent.
43推 5:39 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that bear witness of Me;
43推 5:40 and you are unwilling to come to Me, that you may have life.
43推 5:41 "I do not receive glory from men;
43推 5:42 but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
43推 5:43 "I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another shall come in his own name, you will receive him.
43推 5:44 "How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another, and you do not seek the glory that is from the [one and] only God?
43推 5:45 "Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope.
43推 5:46 "For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote of Me.
43推 5:47 "But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"
43推 6:1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
43推 6:2 And a great multitude was following Him, because they were seeing the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.
43推 6:3 And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.
43推 6:4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
43推 6:5 Jesus therefore lifting up His eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to Him, *said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"
43推 6:6 And this He was saying to test him; for He Himself knew what He was intending to do.
43推 6:7 Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little."
43推 6:8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, *said to Him,
43推 6:9 "There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?"
43推 6:10 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
43推 6:11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted.
43推 6:12 And when they were filled, He *said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments that nothing may be lost."
43推 6:13 And so they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
43推 6:14 When therefore the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, "This is of a truth the Prophet who is to come into the world."
43推 6:15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force, to make Him king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
43推 6:16 Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
43推 6:17 and after getting into a boat, they [started to] cross the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
43推 6:18 And the sea [began] to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.
43推 6:19 When therefore they had rowed about three or four miles, they *beheld Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.
43推 6:20 But He *said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."
43推 6:21 They were willing therefore to receive Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
43推 6:22 The next day the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with His disciples into the boat, but [that] His disciples had gone away alone.
43推 6:23 There came other small boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43推 6:24 When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
43推 6:25 And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You get here?"
43推 6:26 Jesus answered them and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
43推 6:27 "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give to you, for on Him the Father, [even] God, has set His seal."
43推 6:28 They said therefore to Him, "What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?"
43推 6:29 Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent."
43推 6:30 They said therefore to Him, "What then do You do for a sign, that we may see, and believe You? What work do You perform?
43推 6:31 "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ' HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT. '"
43推 6:32 Jesus therefore said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.
43推 6:33 "For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
43推 6:34 They said therefore to Him, "Lord, evermore give us this bread."
43推 6:35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.
43推 6:36 "But I said to you, that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe.
43推 6:37 "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.
43推 6:38 "For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
43推 6:39 "And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.
43推 6:40 "For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him, may have eternal life; and I Myself will raise him up on the last day."
43推 6:41 The Jews therefore were grumbling about Him, because He said, "I am the bread that came down out of heaven."
43推 6:42 And they were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?"
43推 6:43 Jesus answered and said to them, "Do not grumble among yourselves.
43推 6:44 "No one can come to Me, unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
43推 6:45 "It is written in the prophets, 'AND THEY SHALL ALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.
43推 6:46 "Not that any man has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.
43推 6:47 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.
43推 6:48 "I am the bread of life.
43推 6:49 "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
43推 6:50 "This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.
43推 6:51 "I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread also which I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh."
43推 6:52 The Jews therefore [began] to argue with one another, saying, "How can this man give us [His] flesh to eat?"
43推 6:53 Jesus therefore said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.
43推 6:54 "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
43推 6:55 "For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
43推 6:56 "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.
43推 6:57 "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.
43推 6:58 "This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate, and died, he who eats this bread shall live forever."
43推 6:59 These things He said in the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum.
43推 6:60 Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard [this] said, "This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?"
43推 6:61 But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
43推 6:62 ["What] then if you should behold the Son of Man ascending where He was before?
43推 6:63 "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
43推 6:64 "But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
43推 6:65 And He was saying, "For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me, unless it has been granted him from the Father."
43推 6:66 As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew, and were not walking with Him anymore.
43推 6:67 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
43推 6:68 Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.
43推 6:69 "And we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God."
43推 6:70 Jesus answered them, "Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and [ yet] one of you is a devil?"
43推 6:71 Now He meant Judas [the son] of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him.
43推 7:1 And after these things Jesus was walking in Galilee; for He was unwilling to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
43推 7:2 Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
43推 7:3 His brothers therefore said to Him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing.
43推 7:4 "For no one does anything in secret, when he himself seeks to be [known] publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."
43推 7:5 For not even His brothers were believing in Him.
43推 7:6 Jesus therefore *said to them, "My time is not yet at hand, but your time is always opportune.
43推 7:7 "The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.
43推 7:8 "Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come."
43推 7:9 And having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee.
43推 7:10 But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as it were, in secret.
43推 7:11 The Jews therefore were seeking Him at the feast, and were saying, " Where is He? "
43推 7:12 And there was much grumbling among the multitudes concerning Him; some were saying, "He is a good man"; others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He leads the multitude astray."
43推 7:13 Yet no one was speaking openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
43推 7:14 But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and [began to] teach.
43推 7:15 The Jews therefore were marveling, saying, "How has this man become learned, having never been educated?"
43推 7:16 Jesus therefore answered them, and said, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
43推 7:17 "If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or [whether] I speak from Myself.
43推 7:18 "He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
43推 7:19 "Did not Moses give you the Law, and [yet] none of you carries out the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?"
43推 7:20 The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill You?"
43推 7:21 Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel.
43推 7:22 "On this account Moses has given you circumcision (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on [the] Sabbath you circumcise a man.
43推 7:23 "If a man receives circumcision on [the] Sabbath that the Law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on [the] Sabbath?
43推 7:24 "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."
43推 7:25 Therefore some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not the man whom they are seeking to kill?
43推 7:26 "And look, He is speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the Christ, do they?
43推 7:27 "However, we know where this man is from; but whenever the Christ may come, no one knows where He is from."
43推 7:28 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
43推 7:29 "I know Him; because I am from Him, and He sent Me."
43推 7:30 They were seeking therefore to seize Him; and no man laid his hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
43推 7:31 But many of the multitude believed in Him; and they were saying, "When the Christ shall come, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?"
43推 7:32 The Pharisees heard the multitude muttering these things about Him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize Him.
43推 7:33 Jesus therefore said, "For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me.
43推 7:34 "You shall seek Me, and shall not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43推 7:35 The Jews therefore said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?
43推 7:36 "What is this statement that He said, 'You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
43推 7:37 Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.
43推 7:38 "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.'"
43推 7:39 But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet [given,] because Jesus was not yet glorified.
43推 7:40 [Some] of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, "This certainly is the Prophet."
43推 7:41 Others were saying, "This is the Christ." Still others were saying, " Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?
43推 7:42 "Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
43推 7:43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of Him.
43推 7:44 And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
43推 7:45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring Him?"
43推 7:46 The officers answered, "Never did a man speak the way this man speaks."
43推 7:47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You have not also been led astray, have you?
43推 7:48 "No one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him, has he?
43推 7:49 "But this multitude which does not know the Law is accursed."
43推 7:50 Nicodemus *said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),
43推 7:51 "Our Law does not judge a man, unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?"
43推 7:52 They answered and said to him, "You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee."
43推 7:53 {And everyone went to his home.
43推 8:1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43推 8:2 And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and [began] to teach them.
43推 8:3 And the scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,
43推 8:4 they *said to Him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.
43推 8:5 "Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?"
43推 8:6 And they were saying this, testing Him, in order that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground.
43推 8:7 But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him [be the] first to throw a stone at her."
43推 8:8 And again He stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
43推 8:9 And when they heard it, they [began] to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
43推 8:10 And straightening up, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"
43推 8:11 And she said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go your way. From now on sin no more."}
43推 8:12 Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life."
43推 8:13 The Pharisees therefore said to Him, "You are bearing witness of Yourself; Your witness is not true."
43推 8:14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, or where I am going.
43推 8:15 "You people judge according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.
43推 8:16 "But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone [in it,] but I and He who sent Me.
43推 8:17 "Even in your law it has been written, that the testimony of two men is true.
43推 8:18 "I am He who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me."
43推 8:19 And so they were saying to Him, "Where is Your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither Me, nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also."
43推 8:20 These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
43推 8:21 He said therefore again to them, "I go away, and you shall seek Me, and shall die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come."
43推 8:22 Therefore the Jews were saying, "Surely He will not kill Himself, will He, since He says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"
43推 8:23 And He was saying to them, "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
43推 8:24 "I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am [He], you shall die in your sins."
43推 8:25 And so they were saying to Him, "Who are You?" Jesus said to them, " What have I been saying to you [from] the beginning?
43推 8:26 "I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I speak to the world."
43推 8:27 They did not realize that He had been speaking to them about the Father.
43推 8:28 Jesus therefore said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [He,] and I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.
43推 8:29 "And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him."
43推 8:30 As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.
43推 8:31 Jesus therefore was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you abide in My word, [then] you are truly disciples of Mine;
43推 8:32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. "
43推 8:33 They answered Him, "We are Abraham's offspring, and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 'You shall become free'?"
43推 8:34 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.
43推 8:35 "And the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.
43推 8:36 "If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
43推 8:37 "I know that you are Abraham's offspring; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.
43推 8:38 "I speak the things which I have seen with [My] Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from [your] father."
43推 8:39 They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus *said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham.
43推 8:40 "But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.
43推 8:41 "You are doing the deeds of your father." They said to Him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God."
43推 8:42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me; for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.
43推 8:43 "Why do you not understand what I am saying? [It is] because you cannot hear My word.
43推 8:44 "You are of [your] father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own [nature;] for he is a liar, and the father of lies.
43推 8:45 "But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.
43推 8:46 "Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?
43推 8:47 "He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear [them,] because you are not of God."
43推 8:48 The Jews answered and said to Him, "Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
43推 8:49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
43推 8:50 "But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.
43推 8:51 "Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall never see death."
43推 8:52 The Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets [also]; and You say, 'If anyone keeps My word, he shall never taste of death.'
43推 8:53 "Surely You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too; whom do You make Yourself out [to be]?"
43推 8:54 Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God';
43推 8:55 and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him; and if I say that I do not know Him, I shall be a liar like you, but I do know Him, and keep His word.
43推 8:56 "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw [it] and was glad."
43推 8:57 The Jews therefore said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"
43推 8:58 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am."
43推 8:59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple.
43推 9:1 And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.
43推 9:2 And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?"
43推 9:3 Jesus answered, "[It was] neither [that] this man sinned, nor his parents; but [it was] in order that the works of God might be displayed in him.
43推 9:4 "We must work the works of Him who sent Me, as long as it is day; night is coming, when no man can work.
43推 9:5 "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43推 9:6 When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,
43推 9:7 and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). And so he went away and washed, and came [back] seeing.
43推 9:8 The neighbors therefore, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, "Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?"
43推 9:9 Others were saying, "This is he," [still] others were saying, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am the one."
43推 9:10 Therefore they were saying to him, "How then were your eyes opened?"
43推 9:11 He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam, and wash'; so I went away and washed, and I received sight."
43推 9:12 And they said to him, "Where is He?" He *said, "I do not know."
43推 9:13 They *brought to the Pharisees him who was formerly blind.
43推 9:14 Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
43推 9:15 Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he received his sight. And he said to them, "He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see."
43推 9:16 Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?" And there was a division among them.
43推 9:17 They *said therefore to the blind man again, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet."
43推 9:18 The Jews therefore did not believe [it] of him, that he had been blind, and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,
43推 9:19 and questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?"
43推 9:20 His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
43推 9:21 but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he shall speak for himself. "
43推 9:22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed, that if anyone should confess Him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
43推 9:23 For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
43推 9:24 So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner."
43推 9:25 He therefore answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
43推 9:26 They said therefore to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"
43推 9:27 He answered them, "I told you already, and you did not listen; why do you want to hear [it] again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?"
43推 9:28 And they reviled him, and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
43推 9:29 "We know that God has spoken to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where He is from."
43推 9:30 The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and [yet] He opened my eyes.
43推 9:31 "We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing, and does His will, He hears him.
43推 9:32 "Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
43推 9:33 "If this man were not from God, He could do nothing."
43推 9:34 They answered and said to him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?" And they put him out.
43推 9:35 Jesus heard that they had put him out; and finding him, He said, " Do you believe in the Son of Man? "
43推 9:36 He answered and said, "And who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"
43推 9:37 Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you."
43推 9:38 And he said, "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped Him.
43推 9:39 And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
43推 9:40 Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things, and said to Him, "We are not blind too, are we?"
43推 9:41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.
43推 10:1 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
43推 10:2 "But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
43推 10:3 "To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
43推 10:4 "When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
43推 10:5 "And a stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."
43推 10:6 This figure of speech Jesus spoke to them, but they did not understand what those things were which He had been saying to them.
43推 10:7 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
43推 10:8 "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
43推 10:9 "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
43推 10:10 "The thief comes only to steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly.
43推 10:11 "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
43推 10:12 "He who is a hireling, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, beholds the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees, and the wolf snatches them, and scatters [them.]
43推 10:13 ["He flees] because he is a hireling, and is not concerned about the sheep.
43推 10:14 "I am the good shepherd; and I know My own, and My own know Me,
43推 10:15 even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
43推 10:16 "And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice; and they shall become one flock [with] one shepherd.
43推 10:17 "For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.
43推 10:18 "No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father."
43推 10:19 There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.
43推 10:20 And many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?"
43推 10:21 Others were saying, "These are not the sayings of one demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?"
43推 10:22 At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem;
43推 10:23 it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.
43推 10:24 The Jews therefore gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, "How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly."
43推 10:25 Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these bear witness of Me.
43推 10:26 "But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.
43推 10:27 "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;
43推 10:28 and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.
43推 10:29 "My Father, who has given [them] to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father's hand.
43推 10:30 "I and the Father are one."
43推 10:31 The Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
43推 10:32 Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?"
43推 10:33 The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out [to be] God."
43推 10:34 Jesus answered them, "Has it not been written in your Law, 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'?
43推 10:35 "If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),
43推 10:36 do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?
43推 10:37 "If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;
43推 10:38 but if I do them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father. "
43推 10:39 Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, and He eluded their grasp.
43推 10:40 And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there.
43推 10:41 And many came to Him and were saying, "While John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true."
43推 10:42 And many believed in Him there.
43推 11:1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
43推 11:2 And it was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
43推 11:3 The sisters therefore sent to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick."
43推 11:4 But when Jesus heard it, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
43推 11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
43推 11:6 When therefore He heard that he was sick, He stayed then two days [ longer] in the place where He was.
43推 11:7 Then after this He *said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."
43推 11:8 The disciples *said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
43推 11:9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
43推 11:10 "But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
43推 11:11 This He said, and after that He *said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awaken him out of sleep."
43推 11:12 The disciples therefore said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
43推 11:13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.
43推 11:14 Then Jesus therefore said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,
43推 11:15 and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him. "
43推 11:16 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to [his] fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him."
43推 11:17 So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
43推 11:18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;
43推 11:19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning [their] brother.
43推 11:20 Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary still sat in the house.
43推 11:21 Martha therefore said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
43推 11:22 "Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
43推 11:23 Jesus *said to her, "Your brother shall rise again."
43推 11:24 Martha *said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
43推 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall live even if he dies,
43推 11:26 and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this? "
43推 11:27 She *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, [even] He who comes into the world."
43推 11:28 And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister, saying secretly, "The Teacher is here, and is calling for you."
43推 11:29 And when she heard it, she *arose quickly, and was coming to Him.
43推 11:30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
43推 11:31 The Jews then who were with her in the house, and consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
43推 11:32 Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw Him, and fell at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
43推 11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her, [also] weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled,
43推 11:34 and said, "Where have you laid him?" They *said to Him, "Lord, come and see."
43推 11:35 Jesus wept.
43推 11:36 And so the Jews were saying, "Behold how He loved him!"
43推 11:37 But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have kept this man also from dying?"
43推 11:38 Jesus therefore again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
43推 11:39 Jesus *said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been [dead] four days."
43推 11:40 Jesus *said to her, "Did I not say to you, if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"
43推 11:41 And so they removed the stone. And Jesus raised His eyes, and said, "Father, I thank Thee that Thou heardest Me.
43推 11:42 "And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people standing around I said it, that they may believe that Thou didst send Me."
43推 11:43 And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, " Lazarus, come forth. "
43推 11:44 He who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings; and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
43推 11:45 Many therefore of the Jews, who had come to Mary and beheld what He had done, believed in Him.
43推 11:46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
43推 11:47 Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.
43推 11:48 "If we let Him [go on] like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
43推 11:49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
43推 11:50 nor do you take into account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish. "
43推 11:51 Now this he did not say on his own initiative; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
43推 11:52 and not for the nation only, but that He might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
43推 11:53 So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.
43推 11:54 Jesus therefore no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews, but went away from there to the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there He stayed with the disciples.
43推 11:55 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, to purify themselves.
43推 11:56 Therefore they were seeking for Jesus, and were saying to one another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?"
43推 11:57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him.
43推 12:1 Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
43推 12:2 So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining [at the table] with Him.
43推 12:3 Mary therefore took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
43推 12:4 But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said,
43推 12:5 "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii, and given to poor [people]?"
43推 12:6 Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it.
43推 12:7 Jesus therefore said, "Let her alone, in order that she may keep it for the day of My burial.
43推 12:8 "For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me."
43推 12:9 The great multitude therefore of the Jews learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.
43推 12:10 But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus to death also;
43推 12:11 because on account of him many of the Jews were going away, and were believing in Jesus.
43推 12:12 On the next day the great multitude who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
43推 12:13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet Him, and [began] to cry out, "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel."
43推 12:14 And Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,
43推 12:15 "FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A Donkey's COLT."
43推 12:16 These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
43推 12:17 And so the multitude who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, were bearing Him witness.
43推 12:18 For this cause also the multitude went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.
43推 12:19 The Pharisees therefore said to one another, "You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him."
43推 12:20 Now there were certain Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;
43推 12:21 these therefore came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and [began to] ask him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
43推 12:22 Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came, and they * told Jesus.
43推 12:23 And Jesus *answered them, saying, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43推 12:24 "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
43推 12:25 "He who loves his life loses it; and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.
43推 12:26 "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall My servant also be; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
43推 12:27 "Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour.
43推 12:28 "Father, glorify Thy name." There came therefore a voice out of heaven "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
43推 12:29 The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."
43推 12:30 Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.
43推 12:31 "Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.
43推 12:32 "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."
43推 12:33 But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.
43推 12:34 The multitude therefore answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
43推 12:35 Jesus therefore said to them, "For a little while longer the light is among you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.
43推 12:36 "While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light." These things Jesus spoke, and He departed and hid Himself from them.
43推 12:37 But though He had performed so many signs before them, [yet] they were not believing in Him;
43推 12:38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?"
43推 12:39 For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
43推 12:40 "HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES, AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART; LEST THEY SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED, AND I HEAL THEM."
43推 12:41 These things Isaiah said, because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him.
43推 12:42 Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing [Him,] lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
43推 12:43 for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.
43推 12:44 And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me does not believe in Me, but in Him who sent Me.
43推 12:45 "And he who beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me.
43推 12:46 "I have come [as] light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness.
43推 12:47 "And if anyone hears My sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
43推 12:48 "He who rejects Me, and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day.
43推 12:49 "For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me commandment, what to say, and what to speak.
43推 12:50 "And I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me."
43推 13:1 Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
43推 13:2 And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon, to betray Him,
43推 13:3 [Jesus,] knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going back to God,
43推 13:4 *rose from supper, and *laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself about.
43推 13:5 Then He *poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
43推 13:6 And so He *came to Simon Peter. He *said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"
43推 13:7 Jesus answered and said to him, "What I do you do not realize now, but you shall understand hereafter."
43推 13:8 Peter *said to Him, "Never shall You wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."
43推 13:9 Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."
43推 13:10 Jesus *said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all [of you.]"
43推 13:11 For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, "Not all of you are clean."
43推 13:12 And so when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and reclined [at the table] again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
43推 13:13 "You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for [so] I am.
43推 13:14 "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
43推 13:15 "For I gave you an example that you also should do as I did to you.
43推 13:16 "Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master; neither [is] one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.
43推 13:17 "If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
43推 13:18 "I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen; but [ it is] that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'HE WHO EATS MY BREAD HAS LIFTED UP HIS HEEL AGAINST ME.'
43推 13:19 "From now on I am telling you before [it] comes to pass, so that when it does occur, you may believe that I am [He.]
43推 13:20 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
43推 13:21 When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."
43推 13:22 The disciples [began] looking at one another, at a loss [to know] of which one He was speaking.
43推 13:23 There was reclining on Jesus' breast one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.
43推 13:24 Simon Peter therefore *gestured to him, and *said to him, "Tell [us] who it is of whom He is speaking."
43推 13:25 He, leaning back thus on Jesus' breast, *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"
43推 13:26 Jesus therefore *answered, "That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him." So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot.
43推 13:27 And after the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Jesus therefore *said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
43推 13:28 Now no one of those reclining [at the table] knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
43推 13:29 For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast"; or else, that he should give something to the poor.
43推 13:30 And so after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
43推 13:31 When therefore he had gone out, Jesus *said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;
43推 13:32 if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
43推 13:33 "Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You shall seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, I now say to you also, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'
43推 13:34 "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
43推 13:35 "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."
43推 13:36 Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you shall follow later."
43推 13:37 Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You."
43推 13:38 Jesus *answered, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a cock shall not crow, until you deny Me three times.
43推 14:1 "Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.
43推 14:2 "In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
43推 14:3 "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to Myself; that where I am, [there] you may be also.
43推 14:4 "And you know the way where I am going."
43推 14:5 Thomas *said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?"
43推 14:6 Jesus *said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me.
43推 14:7 "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him."
43推 14:8 Philip *said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."
43推 14:9 Jesus *said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and [yet] you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how do you say, 'Show us the Father'?
43推 14:10 "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works.
43推 14:11 "Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me; otherwise believe on account of the works themselves.
43推 14:12 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.
43推 14:13 "And whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
43推 14:14 "If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do [it.]
43推 14:15 "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
43推 14:16 "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;
43推 14:17 [that is] the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him, [but] you know Him because He abides with you, and will be in you.
43推 14:18 "I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
43推 14:19 "After a little while the world will behold Me no more; but you [will] behold Me; because I live, you shall live also.
43推 14:20 "In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
43推 14:21 "He who has My commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves Me; and he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him, and will disclose Myself to him."
43推 14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) *said to Him, "Lord, what then has happened that You are going to disclose Yourself to us, and not to the world?"
43推 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and make Our abode with him.
43推 14:24 "He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me.
43推 14:25 "These things I have spoken to you, while abiding with you.
43推 14:26 "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
43推 14:27 "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.
43推 14:28 "You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.
43推 14:29 "And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, you may believe.
43推 14:30 "I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;
43推 14:31 but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
43推 15:1 "I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.
43推 15:2 "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every [branch] that bears fruit, He prunes it, that it may bear more fruit.
43推 15:3 "You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
43推 15:4 "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither [can] you, unless you abide in Me.
43推 15:5 "I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.
43推 15:6 "If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch, and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
43推 15:7 "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you.
43推 15:8 "By this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and [so] prove to be My disciples.
43推 15:9 "Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.
43推 15:10 "If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.
43推 15:11 "These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may be in you, and [that] your joy may be made full.
43推 15:12 "This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.
43推 15:13 "Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.
43推 15:14 "You are My friends, if you do what I command you.
43推 15:15 "No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.
43推 15:16 "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask of the Father in My name, He may give to you.
43推 15:17 "This I command you, that you love one another.
43推 15:18 "If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before [it hated] you.
43推 15:19 "If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
43推 15:20 "Remember the word that I said to you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also.
43推 15:21 "But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.
43推 15:22 "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
43推 15:23 "He who hates Me hates My Father also.
43推 15:24 "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.
43推 15:25 "But [they have done this] in order that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their Law, 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.'
43推 15:26 "When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, [ that is] the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness of Me,
43推 15:27 and you [will] bear witness also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
43推 16:1 "These things I have spoken to you, that you may be kept from stumbling.
43推 16:2 "They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.
43推 16:3 "And these things they will do, because they have not known the Father, or Me.
43推 16:4 "But these things I have spoken to you, that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
43推 16:5 "But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'
43推 16:6 "But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
43推 16:7 "But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper shall not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
43推 16:8 "And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment;
43推 16:9 concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me;
43推 16:10 and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you no longer behold Me;
43推 16:11 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
43推 16:12 "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear [them] now.
43推 16:13 "But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
43推 16:14 "He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall disclose [it] to you.
43推 16:15 "All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said, that He takes of Mine, and will disclose [it] to you.
43推 16:16 "A little while, and you will no longer behold Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me."
43推 16:17 [Some] of His disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this thing He is telling us, 'A little while, and you will not behold Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?"
43推 16:18 And so they were saying, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking about."
43推 16:19 Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, " Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, 'A little while, and you will not behold Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'?
43推 16:20 "Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned to joy.
43推 16:21 "Whenever a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she remembers the anguish no more, for joy that a child has been born into the world.
43推 16:22 "Therefore you too now have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.
43推 16:23 "And in that day you will ask Me no question. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you shall ask the Father for anything, He will give it to you in My name.
43推 16:24 "Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
43推 16:25 "These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; an hour is coming when I will speak no more to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly of the Father.
43推 16:26 "In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request the Father on your behalf;
43推 16:27 for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
43推 16:28 "I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world; I am leaving the world again, and going to the Father."
43推 16:29 His disciples *said, "Lo, now You are speaking plainly, and are not using a figure of speech.
43推 16:30 "Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God."
43推 16:31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
43推 16:32 "Behold, an hour is coming, and has [already] come, for you to be scattered, each to his own [home,] and to leave Me alone; and [yet] I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
43推 16:33 "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world."
43推 17:1 These things Jesus spoke; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son may glorify Thee,
43推 17:2 even as Thou gavest Him authority over all mankind, that to all whom Thou hast given Him, He may give eternal life.
43推 17:3 "And this is eternal life, that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.
43推 17:4 "I glorified Thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which Thou hast given Me to do.
43推 17:5 "And now, glorify Thou Me together with Thyself, Father, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.
43推 17:6 "I manifested Thy name to the men whom Thou gavest Me out of the world; Thine they were, and Thou gavest them to Me, and they have kept Thy word.
43推 17:7 "Now they have come to know that everything Thou hast given Me is from Thee;
43推 17:8 for the words which Thou gavest Me I have given to them; and they received [them,] and truly understood that I came forth from Thee, and they believed that Thou didst send Me.
43推 17:9 "I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom Thou hast given Me; for they are Thine;
43推 17:10 and all things that are Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
43推 17:11 "And I am no more in the world; and [yet] they themselves are in the world, and I come to Thee. Holy Father, keep them in Thy name, [the name] which Thou hast given Me, that they may be one, even as We [are.]
43推 17:12 "While I was with them, I was keeping them in Thy name which Thou hast given Me; and I guarded them, and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
43推 17:13 "But now I come to Thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy made full in themselves.
43推 17:14 "I have given them Thy word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
43推 17:15 "I do not ask Thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil [one.]
43推 17:16 "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
43推 17:17 "Sanctify them in the truth; Thy word is truth.
43推 17:18 "As Thou didst send Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
43推 17:19 "And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
43推 17:20 "I do not ask in behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;
43推 17:21 that they may all be one; even as Thou, Father, [art] in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that Thou didst send Me.
43推 17:22 "And the glory which Thou hast given Me I have given to them; that they may be one, just as We are one;
43推 17:23 I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, that the world may know that Thou didst send Me, and didst love them, even as Thou didst love Me.
43推 17:24 "Father, I desire that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am, in order that they may behold My glory, which Thou hast given Me; for Thou didst love Me before the foundation of the world.
43推 17:25 "O righteous Father, although the world has not known Thee, yet I have known Thee; and these have known that Thou didst send Me;
43推 17:26 and I have made Thy name known to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith Thou didst love Me may be in them, and I in them. "
43推 18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden, into which He Himself entered, and His disciples.
43推 18:2 Now Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place; for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
43推 18:3 Judas then, having received the [Roman] cohort, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, *came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
43推 18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth, and *said to them, "Whom do you seek?"
43推 18:5 They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He *said to them, "I am [He.]" And Judas also who was betraying Him, was standing with them.
43推 18:6 When therefore He said to them, "I am [He]," they drew back, and fell to the ground.
43推 18:7 Again therefore He asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, " Jesus the Nazarene. "
43推 18:8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am [He]; if therefore you seek Me, let these go their way,"
43推 18:9 that the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, "Of those whom Thou hast given Me I lost not one."
43推 18:10 Simon Peter therefore having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave's name was Malchus.
43推 18:11 Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"
43推 18:12 So the [Roman] cohort and the commander, and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him,
43推 18:13 and led Him to Annas first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
43推 18:14 Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people.
43推 18:15 And Simon Peter was following Jesus, and [so was] another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest,
43推 18:16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought in Peter.
43推 18:17 The slave-girl therefore who kept the door *said to Peter, "You are not also [one] of this man's disciples, are you?" He *said, "I am not."
43推 18:18 Now the slaves and the officers were standing [there,] having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
43推 18:19 The high priest therefore questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.
43推 18:20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.
43推 18:21 "Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them; behold, these know what I said."
43推 18:22 And when He had said this, one of the officers standing by gave Jesus a blow, saying, "Is that the way You answer the high priest?"
43推 18:23 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?"
43推 18:24 Annas therefore sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
43推 18:25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, "You are not also [one] of His disciples, are you?" He denied [it], and said, "I am not."
43推 18:26 One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, "Did I not see you in the garden with Him?"
43推 18:27 Peter therefore denied [it] again; and immediately a cock crowed.
43推 18:28 They *led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium in order that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
43推 18:29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and *said, "What accusation do you bring against this Man?"
43推 18:30 They answered and said to him, "If this Man were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you."
43推 18:31 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "We are not permitted to put anyone to death,"
43推 18:32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.
43推 18:33 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and summoned Jesus, and said to Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"
43推 18:34 Jesus answered, "Are you saying this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about Me?"
43推 18:35 Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered You up to me; what have You done?"
43推 18:36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm."
43推 18:37 Pilate therefore said to Him, "So You are a king?" Jesus answered, " You say [correctly] that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice. "
43推 18:38 Pilate *said to Him, "What is truth?" And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and *said to them, "I find no guilt in Him.
43推 18:39 "But you have a custom, that I should release someone for you at the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the Jews?"
43推 18:40 Therefore they cried out again, saying, "Not this Man, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.
43推 19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him.
43推 19:2 And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and arrayed Him in a purple robe;
43推 19:3 and they [began] to come up to Him, and say, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and to give Him blows [in the face.]
43推 19:4 And Pilate came out again, and *said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no guilt in Him."
43推 19:5 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And [Pilate] *said to them, "Behold, the Man!"
43推 19:6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify!" Pilate *said to them, "Take Him yourselves, and crucify Him, for I find no guilt in Him."
43推 19:7 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law He ought to die because He made Himself out [to be] the Son of God."
43推 19:8 When Pilate therefore heard this statement, he was the more afraid;
43推 19:9 and he entered into the Praetorium again, and *said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
43推 19:10 Pilate therefore *said to Him, "You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You, and I have authority to crucify You?"
43推 19:11 Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me up to you has [the] greater sin."
43推 19:12 As a result of this Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this Man, you are no friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself out [to be] a king opposes Caesar."
43推 19:13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
43推 19:14 Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he *said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
43推 19:15 They therefore cried out, "Away with [Him], away with [Him,] crucify Him!" Pilate *said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
43推 19:16 So he then delivered Him to them to be crucified.
43推 19:17 They took Jesus therefore, and He went out, bearing His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
43推 19:18 There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.
43推 19:19 And Pilate wrote an inscription also, and put it on the cross. And it was written, "JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
43推 19:20 Therefore this inscription many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, [and] in Greek.
43推 19:21 And so the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews'; but that He said,' I am King of the Jews. '"
43推 19:22 Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."
43推 19:23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and [also] the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.
43推 19:24 They said therefore to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, [to decide] whose it shall be"; that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "THEY DIVIDED MY OUTER GARMENTS AMONG THEM, AND FOR MY CLOTHING THEY CAST LOTS."
43推 19:25 Therefore the soldiers did these things. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43推 19:26 When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He *said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"
43推 19:27 Then He *said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her into his own [household.]
43推 19:28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, *said, "I am thirsty."
43推 19:29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon [a branch of] hyssop, and brought it up to His mouth.
43推 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit.
43推 19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high [day]), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.
43推 19:32 The soldiers therefore came, and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other man who was crucified with Him;
43推 19:33 but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs;
43推 19:34 but one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
43推 19:35 And he who has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.
43推 19:36 For these things came to pass, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN."
43推 19:37 And again another Scripture says, "THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED."
43推 19:38 And after these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a secret [one,] for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate granted permission. He came therefore, and took away His body.
43推 19:39 And Nicodemus came also, who had first come to Him by night; bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].
43推 19:40 And so they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
43推 19:41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
43推 19:42 Therefore on account of the Jewish day of preparation, because the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
43推 20:1 Now on the first [day] of the week Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone [already] taken away from the tomb.
43推 20:2 And so she *ran and *came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."
43推 20:3 Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they were going to the tomb.
43推 20:4 And the two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first;
43推 20:5 and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying [there;] but he did not go in.
43推 20:6 Simon Peter therefore also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *beheld the linen wrappings lying [there,]
43推 20:7 and the face-cloth, which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.
43推 20:8 So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb entered then also, and he saw and believed.
43推 20:9 For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.
43推 20:10 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
43推 20:11 But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
43推 20:12 and she *beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.
43推 20:13 And they *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She *said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
43推 20:14 When she had said this, she turned around, and *beheld Jesus standing [there,] and did not know that it was Jesus.
43推 20:15 Jesus *said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" Supposing Him to be the gardener, she *said to Him, "Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away."
43推 20:16 Jesus *said to her, "Mary!" She *turned and *said to Him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means, Teacher).
43推 20:17 Jesus *said to her, "Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren, and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'"
43推 20:18 Mary Magdalene *came, announcing to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord," and [that] He had said these things to her.
43推 20:19 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and *said to them, "Peace [be] with you."
43推 20:20 And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
43推 20:21 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace [be] with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."
43推 20:22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and *said to them, " Receive the Holy Spirit.
43推 20:23 "If you forgive the sins of any, [their sins] have been forgiven them; if you retain the [sins] of any, they have been retained."
43推 20:24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
43推 20:25 The other disciples therefore were saying to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I shall see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe."
43推 20:26 And after eight days again His disciples were inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus *came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst, and said, "Peace [be] with you."
43推 20:27 Then He *said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand, and put it into My side; and be not unbelieving, but believing."
43推 20:28 Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
43推 20:29 Jesus *said to him, "Because you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed [are] they who did not see, and [yet] believed."
43推 20:30 Many other signs therefore Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
43推 20:31 but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.
43推 21:1 After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested [Himself] in this way.
43推 21:2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples.
43推 21:3 Simon Peter *said to them, "I am going fishing." They *said to him, " We will also come with you. "They went out, and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.
43推 21:4 But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
43推 21:5 Jesus therefore *said to them, "Children, you do not have any fish, do you?" They answered Him, "No."
43推 21:6 And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find [a catch]." They cast therefore, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
43推 21:7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved *said to Peter, "It is the Lord." And so when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped [for work]), and threw himself into the sea.
43推 21:8 But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about one hundred yards away, dragging the net [full] of fish.
43推 21:9 And so when they got out upon the land, they *saw a charcoal fire [ already] laid, and fish placed on it, and bread.
43推 21:10 Jesus *said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have now caught."
43推 21:11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
43推 21:12 Jesus *said to them, "Come [and] have breakfast." None of the disciples ventured to question Him, "Who are You?" knowing that it was the Lord.
43推 21:13 Jesus *came and *took the bread, and *gave them, and the fish likewise.
43推 21:14 This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.
43推 21:15 So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus *said to Simon Peter, " Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me more than these? "He *said to Him," Yes, Lord; You know that I love You. "He *said to him," Tend My lambs. "
43推 21:16 He *said to him again a second time, "Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me?" He *said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I love You." He *said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."
43推 21:17 He *said to him the third time, "Simon, [son] of John, do you love Me?" Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?" And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus *said to him, "Tend My sheep.
43推 21:18 "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to gird yourself, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will gird you, and bring you where you do not wish to [go."]
43推 21:19 Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He *said to him, "Follow Me!"
43推 21:20 Peter, turning around, *saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following [them;] the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"
43推 21:21 Peter therefore seeing him *said to Jesus, "Lord, and what about this man?"
43推 21:22 Jesus *said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what [is that] to you? You follow Me!"
43推 21:23 This saying therefore went out among the brethren that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but [only,] "If I want him to remain until I come, what [is that] to you?"
43推 21:24 This is the disciple who bears witness of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his witness is true.
43推 21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they *were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself *would not contain the books which *were written.
