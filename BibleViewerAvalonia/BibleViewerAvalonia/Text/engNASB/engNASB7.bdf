44Ac 1:1 The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach,
44Ac 1:2 until the day when He was taken up, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.
44Ac 1:3 To these He also presented Himself alive, after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over [a period of] forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.
44Ac 1:4 And gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, "Which," [He said,] " you heard of from Me;
44Ac 1:5 for John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. "
44Ac 1:6 And so when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, " Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel? "
44Ac 1:7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;
44Ac 1:8 but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth. "
44Ac 1:9 And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
44Ac 1:10 And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them;
44Ac 1:11 and they also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven."
44Ac 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
44Ac 1:13 And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas [the son] of James.
44Ac 1:14 These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with [the] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
44Ac 1:15 And at this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,
44Ac 1:16 "Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
44Ac 1:17 "For he was counted among us, and received his portion in this ministry."
44Ac 1:18 (Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.
44Ac 1:19 And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44Ac 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'LET HIS HOMESTEAD BE MADE DESOLATE, AND LET NO MAN DWELL IN IT'; and, 'HIS OFFICE LET ANOTHER MAN TAKE.'
44Ac 1:21 "It is therefore necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us--
44Ac 1:22 beginning with the baptism of John, until the day that He was taken up from us-- one of these should become a witness with us of His resurrection. "
44Ac 1:23 And they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 And they prayed, and said, "Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two Thou hast chosen
44Ac 1:25 to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place. "
44Ac 1:26 And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
44Ac 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
44Ac 2:2 And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent, rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
44Ac 2:3 And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.
44Ac 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.
44Ac 2:5 Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
44Ac 2:6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because they were each one hearing them speak in his own language.
44Ac 2:7 And they were amazed and marveled, saying, "Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
44Ac 2:8 "And how is it that we each hear [them] in our own language to which we were born?
44Ac 2:9 "Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
44Ac 2:11 Cretans and Arabs-- we hear them in our [own] tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God. "
44Ac 2:12 And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
44Ac 2:13 But others were mocking and saying, "They are full of sweet wine."
44Ac 2:14 But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them： "Men of Judea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words.
44Ac 2:15 "For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is [only] the third hour of the day;
44Ac 2:16 but this is what was spoken of through the prophet Joel：
44Ac 2:17 'AND IT SHALL BE IN THE LAST DAYS,' God says, 'THAT I WILL POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT UPON ALL MANKIND; AND YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY, AND YOUR YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE VISIONS, AND YOUR OLD MEN SHALL DREAM DREAMS;
44Ac 2:18 EVEN UPON MY BONDSLAVES, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, I WILL IN THOSE DAYS POUR FORTH OF MY SPIRIT And they shall prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 'AND I WILL GRANT WONDERS IN THE SKY ABOVE, AND SIGNS ON THE EARTH BENEATH, BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOR OF SMOKE.
44Ac 2:20 'THE SUN SHALL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS, AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD, BEFORE THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAY OF THE LORD SHALL COME.
44Ac 2:21 'AND IT SHALL BE, THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED.'
44Ac 2:22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words： Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know--
44Ac 2:23 this [Man], delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put [Him] to death.
44Ac 2:24 "And God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.
44Ac 2:25 "For David says of Him, 'I WAS ALWAYS BEHOLDING THE LORD IN MY PRESENCE; FOR HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, THAT I MAY NOT BE SHAKEN.
44Ac 2:26 'THEREFORE MY HEART WAS GLAD AND MY TONGUE EXULTED; MOREOVER MY FLESH ALSO WILL ABIDE IN HOPE;
44Ac 2:27 BECAUSE THOU WILT NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW THY HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.
44Ac 2:28 'THOU HAST MADE KNOWN TO ME THE WAYS OF LIFE; THOU WILT MAKE ME FULL OF GLADNESS WITH THY PRESENCE.'
44Ac 2:29 "Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
44Ac 2:30 "And so, because he was a prophet, and knew that GOD HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT [one] OF HIS DESCENDANTS UPON HIS THRONE,
44Ac 2:31 he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY .
44Ac 2:32 "This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses.
44Ac 2:33 "Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear.
44Ac 2:34 "For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says： 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD," SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
44Ac 2:35 UNTIL I MAKE THINE ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR THY FEET. "'
44Ac 2:36 "Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ-- this Jesus whom you crucified."
44Ac 2:37 Now when they heard [this], they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"
44Ac 2:38 And Peter [said] to them, "Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 2:39 "For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call to Himself."
44Ac 2:40 And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, "Be saved from this perverse generation!"
44Ac 2:41 So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
44Ac 2:42 And they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
44Ac 2:43 And everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.
44Ac 2:44 And all those who had believed were together, and had all things in common;
44Ac 2:45 and they [began] selling their property and possessions, and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need.
44Ac 2:46 And day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart,
44Ac 2:47 praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth [hour,] the hour of prayer.
44Ac 3:2 And a certain man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple.
44Ac 3:3 And when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he [began] asking to receive alms.
44Ac 3:4 And Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze upon him and said, "Look at us!"
44Ac 3:5 And he [began] to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
44Ac 3:6 But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you： In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene-- walk!"
44Ac 3:7 And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.
44Ac 3:8 And with a leap, he stood upright and [began] to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
44Ac 3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
44Ac 3:10 and they were taking note of him as being the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to [beg] alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44Ac 3:11 And while he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at the so-called portico of Solomon, full of amazement.
44Ac 3:12 But when Peter saw [this], he replied to the people, "Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this, or why do you gaze at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
44Ac 3:13 "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, [the one] whom you delivered up, and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
44Ac 3:14 "But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
44Ac 3:15 but put to death the Prince of life, [the one] whom God raised from the dead, [a fact] to which we are witnesses.
44Ac 3:16 "And on the basis of faith in His name, [it is] the name of Jesus which has strengthened this man whom you see and know; and the faith which [ comes] through Him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.
44Ac 3:17 "And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.
44Ac 3:18 "But the things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
44Ac 3:19 "Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;
44Ac 3:20 and that He may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you,
44Ac 3:21 whom heaven must receive until [the] period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.
44Ac 3:22 "Moses said, 'THE LORD GOD SHALL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED in everything He says to you.
44Ac 3:23 'And it shall be that every soul that does not heed that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
44Ac 3:24 "And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and [his] successors onward, also announced these days.
44Ac 3:25 "It is you who are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'AND IN YOUR SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.'
44Ac 3:26 "For you first, God raised up His Servant, and sent Him to bless you by turning every one [of you] from your wicked ways."
44Ac 4:1 And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple [guard,] and the Sadducees, came upon them,
44Ac 4:2 being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
44Ac 4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.
44Ac 4:4 But many of those who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
44Ac 4:5 And it came about on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
44Ac 4:6 and Annas the high priest [was there,] and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of high-priestly descent.
44Ac 4:7 And when they had placed them in the center, they [began to] inquire, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
44Ac 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people,
44Ac 4:9 if we are on trial today for a benefit done to a sick man, as to how this man has been made well,
44Ac 4:10 let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead-- by this [name] this man stands here before you in good health.
44Ac 4:11 "He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, [but] WHICH BECAME THE VERY CORNER [stone.]
44Ac 4:12 "And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved."
44Ac 4:13 Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John, and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were marveling, and [began] to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
44Ac 4:15 But when they had ordered them to go aside out of the Council, they [began] to confer with one another,
44Ac 4:16 saying, "What shall we do with these men? For the fact that a noteworthy miracle has taken place through them is apparent to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
44Ac 4:17 "But in order that it may not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any man in this name."
44Ac 4:18 And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge;
44Ac 4:20 for we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard. "
44Ac 4:21 And when they had threatened them further, they let them go (finding no basis on which they might punish them) on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God for what had happened;
44Ac 4:22 for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
44Ac 4:23 And when they had been released, they went to their own [companions,] and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
44Ac 4:24 And when they heard [this,] they lifted their voices to God with one accord and said, "O Lord, it is Thou who DIDST MAKE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM,
44Ac 4:25 who by the Holy Spirit, [through] the mouth of our father David Thy servant, didst say, 'WHY DID THE GENTILES RAGE, AND THE PEOPLES DEVISE FUTILE THINGS?
44Ac 4:26 'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD, AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.'
44Ac 4:27 "For truly in this city there were gathered together against Thy holy servant Jesus, whom Thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
44Ac 4:28 to do whatever Thy hand and Thy purpose predestined to occur.
44Ac 4:29 "And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Thy bond-servants may speak Thy word with all confidence,
44Ac 4:30 while Thou dost extend Thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Thy holy servant Jesus. "
44Ac 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and [began] to speak the word of God with boldness.
44Ac 4:32 And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one [of them] claimed that anything belonging to him was his own; but all things were common property to them.
44Ac 4:33 And with great power the apostles were giving witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
44Ac 4:34 For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales,
44Ac 4:35 and lay them at the apostles' feet; and they would be distributed to each, as any had need.
44Ac 4:36 And Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means, Son of Encouragement),
44Ac 4:37 and who owned a tract of land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
44Ac 5:2 and kept back [some] of the price for himself, with his wife's full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [some] of the price of the land?
44Ac 5:4 "While it remained [unsold,] did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."
44Ac 5:5 And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came upon all who heard of it.
44Ac 5:6 And the young men arose and covered him up, and after carrying him out, they buried him.
44Ac 5:7 Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 And Peter responded to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?" And she said, "Yes, that was the price."
44Ac 5:9 Then Peter [said] to her, "Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out [as well]."
44Ac 5:10 And she fell immediately at his feet, and breathed her last; and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44Ac 5:11 And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things.
44Ac 5:12 And at the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were taking place among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's portico.
44Ac 5:13 But none of the rest dared to associate with them; however, the people held them in high esteem.
44Ac 5:14 And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to [their number];
44Ac 5:15 to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the streets, and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on any one of them.
44Ac 5:16 And also the people from the cities in the vicinity of Jerusalem were coming together, bringing people who were sick or afflicted with unclean spirits; and they were all being healed.
44Ac 5:17 But the high priest rose up, along with all his associates (that is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy;
44Ac 5:18 and they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in a public jail.
44Ac 5:19 But an angel of the Lord during the night opened the gates of the prison, and taking them out he said,
44Ac 5:20 "Go your way, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life."
44Ac 5:21 And upon hearing [this,] they entered into the temple about daybreak, and [began] to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates had come, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent [orders] to the prison house for them to be brought.
44Ac 5:22 But the officers who came did not find them in the prison; and they returned, and reported back,
44Ac 5:23 saying, "We found the prison house locked quite securely and the guards standing at the doors; but when we had opened up, we found no one inside."
44Ac 5:24 Now when the captain of the temple [guard] and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this.
44Ac 5:25 But someone came and reported to them, "Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
44Ac 5:26 Then the captain went along with the officers and [proceeded] to bring them [back] without violence (for they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned).
44Ac 5:27 And when they had brought them, they stood them before the Council. And the high priest questioned them,
44Ac 5:28 saying, "We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name, and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
44Ac 5:29 But Peter and the apostles answered and said, "We must obey God rather than men.
44Ac 5:30 "The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had put to death by hanging Him on a cross.
44Ac 5:31 "He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
44Ac 5:32 "And we are witnesses of these things; and [so is] the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him."
44Ac 5:33 But when they heard this, they were cut to the quick and were intending to slay them.
44Ac 5:34 But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.
44Ac 5:35 And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.
44Ac 5:36 "For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody; and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him. And he was slain; and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
44Ac 5:37 "After this man Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away [some] people after him, he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 "And so in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action should be of men, it will be overthrown;
44Ac 5:39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God. "
44Ac 5:40 And they took his advice; and after calling the apostles in, they flogged them and ordered them to speak no more in the name of Jesus, and [then] released them.
44Ac 5:41 So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for [His] name.
44Ac 5:42 And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus [as] the Christ.
44Ac 6:1 Now at this time while the disciples were increasing [in number,] a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic [Jews] against the [native] Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving [of food.]
44Ac 6:2 And the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, " It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables.
44Ac 6:3 "But select from among you, brethren, seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.
44Ac 6:4 "But we will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
44Ac 6:5 And the statement found approval with the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.
44Ac 6:6 And these they brought before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them.
44Ac 6:7 And the word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
44Ac 6:8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, [including] both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and argued with Stephen.
44Ac 6:10 And [yet] they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
44Ac 6:11 Then they secretly induced men to say, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and [against] God."
44Ac 6:12 And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and dragged him away, and brought him before the Council.
44Ac 6:13 And they put forward false witnesses who said, "This man incessantly speaks against this holy place, and the Law;
44Ac 6:14 for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and alter the customs which Moses handed down to us. "
44Ac 6:15 And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw his face like the face of an angel.
44Ac 7:1 And the high priest said, "Are these things so?"
44Ac 7:2 And he said, "Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
44Ac 7:3 and said to him, 'DEPART FROM YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR RELATIVES, AND COME INTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU.'
44Ac 7:4 "Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, [God] removed him into this country in which you are now living.
44Ac 7:5 "And He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground; and [yet,] even when he had no child, He promised that HE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM AS A POSSESSION, AND TO HIS OFFSPRING AFTER HIM.
44Ac 7:6 "But God spoke to this effect, that his OFFSPRING WOULD BE ALIENS IN A FOREIGN LAND, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE ENSLAVED AND MISTREATED FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.
44Ac 7:7 "'AND WHATEVER NATION TO WHICH THEY SHALL BE IN BONDAGE I MYSELF WILL JUDGE,' said God, 'AND AFTER THAT THEY WILL COME OUT AND SERVE ME IN THIS PLACE.'
44Ac 7:8 "And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so [Abraham] became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac [became the father of] Jacob, and Jacob [of] the twelve patriarchs.
44Ac 7:9 "And the patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. And [yet] God was with him,
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him from all his afflictions, and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
44Ac 7:11 "Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction [ with it;] and our fathers could find no food.
44Ac 7:12 "But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers [there] the first time.
44Ac 7:13 "And on the second [visit] Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was disclosed to Pharaoh.
44Ac 7:14 "And Joseph sent [word] and invited Jacob his father and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five persons [in all.]
44Ac 7:15 "And Jacob went down to Egypt and [there] passed away, he and our fathers.
44Ac 7:16 "And [from there] they were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
44Ac 7:17 "But as the time of the promise was approaching which God had assured to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
44Ac 7:18 until THERE AROSE ANOTHER KING OVER EGYPT WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT JOSEPH.
44Ac 7:19 "It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive.
44Ac 7:20 "And it was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God; and he was nurtured three months in his father's home.
44Ac 7:21 "And after he had been exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him away, and nurtured him as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 "And Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds.
44Ac 7:23 "But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
44Ac 7:24 "And when he saw one [of them] being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 "And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him; but they did not understand.
44Ac 7:26 "And on the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, 'Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?'
44Ac 7:27 "But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ' WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND JUDGE OVER US?
44Ac 7:28 'YOU DO NOT MEAN TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN YESTERDAY, DO YOU?'
44Ac 7:29 "And at this remark MOSES FLED, AND BECAME AN ALIEN IN THE LAND OF MIDIAN, where he became the father of two sons.
44Ac 7:30 "And after forty years had passed, AN ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM IN THE WILDERNESS OF MOUNT Sinai, IN THE FLAME OF A BURNING THORN BUSH.
44Ac 7:31 "And when Moses saw it, he [began] to marvel at the sight; and as he approached to look [more] closely, there came the voice of the Lord：
44Ac 7:32 'I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, THE GOD OF ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB.' And Moses shook with fear and would not venture to look.
44Ac 7:33 "BUT THE LORD SAID TO HIM, 'TAKE OFF THE SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET, FOR THE PLACE ON WHICH YOU ARE STANDING IS HOLY GROUND.
44Ac 7:34 'I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN THE OPPRESSION OF MY PEOPLE IN EGYPT, AND HAVE HEARD THEIR GROANS, AND I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM; COME NOW, AND I WILL SEND YOU TO EGYPT.'
44Ac 7:35 "This Moses whom they disowned, saying, 'WHO MADE YOU A RULER AND A JUDGE?' is the one whom God sent [to be] both a ruler and a deliverer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the thorn bush.
44Ac 7:36 "This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
44Ac 7:37 "This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, 'GOD SHALL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME FROM YOUR BRETHREN.'
44Ac 7:38 "This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and [who was] with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to you.
44Ac 7:39 "And our fathers were unwilling to be obedient to him, but repudiated him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,
44Ac 7:40 SAYING TO AARON, 'MAKE FOR US GODS WHO WILL GO BEFORE US; FOR THIS MOSES WHO LED US OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT-- WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.'
44Ac 7:41 "And at that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.
44Ac 7:42 "But God turned away and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'IT WAS NOT TO ME THAT YOU OFFERED VICTIMS AND SACRIFICES FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS, WAS IT, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL?
44Ac 7:43 'YOU ALSO TOOK ALONG THE TABERNACLE OF MOLOCH AND THE STAR OF THE GOD ROMPHA, THE IMAGES WHICH YOU MADE TO WORSHIP THEM. I ALSO WILL REMOVE YOU BEYOND BABYLON.'
44Ac 7:44 "Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed [him] to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.
44Ac 7:45 "And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua upon dispossessing the nations whom God drove out before our fathers, until the time of David.
44Ac 7:46 "And [David] found favor in God's sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44Ac 7:47 "But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.
44Ac 7:48 "However, the Most High does not dwell in [houses] made by [human] hands; as the prophet says：
44Ac 7:49 'HEAVEN IS MY THRONE, AND EARTH IS THE FOOTSTOOL OF MY FEET; WHAT KIND OF HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD FOR ME ?'says the Lord; 'OR WHAT PLACE IS THERE FOR MY REPOSE ?
44Ac 7:50 'WAS IT NOT MY HAND WHICH MADE ALL THESE THINGS?'
44Ac 7:51 "You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers did.
44Ac 7:52 "Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become;
44Ac 7:53 you who received the law as ordained by angels, and [yet] did not keep it. "
44Ac 7:54 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and they [began] gnashing their teeth at him.
44Ac 7:55 But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
44Ac 7:56 and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
44Ac 7:57 But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears, and they rushed upon him with one impulse.
44Ac 7:58 And when they had driven him out of the city, they [began] stoning [ him,] and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44Ac 7:59 And they went on stoning Stephen as he called upon [the Lord] and said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
44Ac 7:60 And falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" And having said this, he fell asleep.
44Ac 8:1 And Saul was in hearty agreement with putting him to death. And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
44Ac 8:2 And [some] devout men buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.
44Ac 8:3 But Saul [began] ravaging the church, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.
44Ac 8:4 Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
44Ac 8:5 And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and [began] proclaiming Christ to them.
44Ac 8:6 And the multitudes with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing.
44Ac 8:7 For [in the case of] many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out [of them] shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
44Ac 8:8 And there was much rejoicing in that city.
44Ac 8:9 Now there was a certain man named Simon, who formerly was practicing magic in the city, and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;
44Ac 8:10 and they all, from smallest to greatest, were giving attention to him, saying, "This man is what is called the Great Power of God."
44Ac 8:11 And they were giving him attention because he had for a long time astonished them with his magic arts.
44Ac 8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were being baptized, men and women alike.
44Ac 8:13 And even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip; and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.
44Ac 8:14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
44Ac 8:15 who came down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:16 For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then they [began] laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
44Ac 8:19 saying, "Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 8:20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
44Ac 8:21 "You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
44Ac 8:22 "Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.
44Ac 8:23 "For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
44Ac 8:24 But Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
44Ac 8:25 And so, when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
44Ac 8:26 But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, "Arise and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert [ road].)
44Ac 8:27 And he arose and went; and behold, there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship.
44Ac 8:28 And he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
44Ac 8:29 And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."
44Ac 8:30 And when Philip had run up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
44Ac 8:31 And he said, "Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this： "HE WAS LED AS A SHEEP TO SLAUGHTER; AND AS A LAMB BEFORE ITS SHEARER IS SILENT, SO HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH.
44Ac 8:33 "IN HUMILIATION HIS JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN AWAY; WHO SHALL RELATE HIS GENERATION? FOR HIS LIFE IS REMOVED FROM THE EARTH."
44Ac 8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please [tell me], of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself, or of someone else?"
44Ac 8:35 And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.
44Ac 8:36 And as they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch *said, "Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?"
44Ac 8:37 {And Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."}
44Ac 8:38 And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch; and he baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.
44Ac 8:40 But Philip found himself at Azotus; and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
44Ac 9:2 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:3 And it came about that as he journeyed, he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him;
44Ac 9:4 and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"
44Ac 9:5 And he said, "Who art Thou, Lord?" And He [said,] "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,
44Ac 9:6 but rise, and enter the city, and it shall be told you what you must do. "
44Ac 9:7 And the men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
44Ac 9:8 And Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
44Ac 9:10 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Behold, [here am] I, Lord."
44Ac 9:11 And the Lord [said] to him, "Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,
44Ac 9:12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might regain his sight. "
44Ac 9:13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he did to Thy saints at Jerusalem;
44Ac 9:14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon Thy name. "
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;
44Ac 9:16 for I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake. "
44Ac 9:17 And Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he arose and was baptized;
44Ac 9:19 and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus,
44Ac 9:20 and immediately he [began] to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
44Ac 9:21 And all those hearing him continued to be amazed, and were saying, " Is this not he who in Jerusalem destroyed those who called on this name, and [who] had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests? "
44Ac 9:22 But Saul kept increasing in strength and confounding the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this [Jesus] is the Christ.
44Ac 9:23 And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him,
44Ac 9:24 but their plot became known to Saul. And they were also watching the gates day and night so that they might put him to death;
44Ac 9:25 but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through [an opening in] the wall, lowering him in a large basket.
44Ac 9:26 And when he had come to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
44Ac 9:27 But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 9:28 And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic [Jews;] but they were attempting to put him to death.
44Ac 9:30 But when the brethren learned [of it], they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
44Ac 9:31 So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and, going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.
44Ac 9:32 Now it came about that as Peter was traveling through all [those parts,] he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years, for he was paralyzed.
44Ac 9:34 And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; arise, and make your bed." And immediately he arose.
44Ac 9:35 And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
44Ac 9:36 Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which translated [in Greek] is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity, which she continually did.
44Ac 9:37 And it came about at that time that she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her body, they laid it in an upper room.
44Ac 9:38 And since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him, "Do not delay to come to us."
44Ac 9:39 And Peter arose and went with them. And when he had come, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing all the tunics and garments that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.
44Ac 9:40 But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
44Ac 9:41 And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
44Ac 9:42 And it became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 And it came about that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain tanner, Simon.
44Ac 10:1 Now [there was] a certain man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,
44Ac 10:2 a devout man, and one who feared God with all his household, and gave many alms to the [Jewish] people, and prayed to God continually.
44Ac 10:3 About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had [just] come in to him, and said to him, "Cornelius!"
44Ac 10:4 And fixing his gaze upon him and being much alarmed, he said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
44Ac 10:5 "And now dispatch [some] men to Joppa, and send for a man [named] Simon, who is also called Peter;
44Ac 10:6 he is staying with a certain tanner [named] Simon, whose house is by the sea. "
44Ac 10:7 And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were in constant attendance upon him,
44Ac 10:8 and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
44Ac 10:9 And on the next day, as they were on their way, and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
44Ac 10:10 And he became hungry, and was desiring to eat; but while they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;
44Ac 10:11 and he *beheld the sky opened up, and a certain object like a great sheet coming down, lowered by four corners to the ground,
44Ac 10:12 and there were in it all [kinds of] four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air.
44Ac 10:13 And a voice came to him, "Arise, Peter, kill and eat!"
44Ac 10:14 But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean."
44Ac 10:15 And again a voice [came] to him a second time, "What God has cleansed, no [longer] consider unholy."
44Ac 10:16 And this happened three times; and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.
44Ac 10:17 Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions for Simon's house, appeared at the gate;
44Ac 10:18 and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.
44Ac 10:19 And while Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 "But arise, go downstairs, and accompany them without misgivings; for I have sent them Myself."
44Ac 10:21 And Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?"
44Ac 10:22 And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews, was [divinely] directed by a holy angel to send for you [to come] to his house and hear a message from you."
44Ac 10:23 And so he invited them in and gave them lodging. And on the next day he arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
44Ac 10:24 And on the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44Ac 10:25 And when it came about that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped [him.]
44Ac 10:26 But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am [just] a man."
44Ac 10:27 And as he talked with him, he entered, and found many people assembled.
44Ac 10:28 And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and [yet] God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.
44Ac 10:29 "That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for. And so I ask for what reason you have sent for me."
44Ac 10:30 And Cornelius said, "Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,
44Ac 10:31 and he *said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
44Ac 10:32 'Send therefore to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon [the] tanner by the sea.'
44Ac 10:33 "And so I sent to you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
44Ac 10:34 And opening his mouth, Peter said： "I most certainly understand [ now] that God is not one to show partiality,
44Ac 10:35 but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right, is welcome to Him.
44Ac 10:36 "The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)--
44Ac 10:37 you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed.
44Ac 10:38 "[You know of] Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and [how] He went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with Him.
44Ac 10:39 "And we are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And they also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.
44Ac 10:40 "God raised Him up on the third day, and granted that He should become visible,
44Ac 10:41 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, [that is,] to us, who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
44Ac 10:42 "And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 "Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins."
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.
44Ac 10:45 And all the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the Gentiles also.
44Ac 10:46 For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,
44Ac 10:47 "Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we [did,] can he?"
44Ac 10:48 And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
44Ac 11:1 Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
44Ac 11:2 And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised took issue with him,
44Ac 11:3 saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."
44Ac 11:4 But Peter began [speaking] and [proceeded] to explain to them in orderly sequence, saying,
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky; and it came right down to me,
44Ac 11:6 and when I had fixed my gaze upon it and was observing it I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air.
44Ac 11:7 "And I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Arise, Peter; kill and eat.'
44Ac 11:8 "But I said, 'By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44Ac 11:9 "But a voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.'
44Ac 11:10 "And this happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky.
44Ac 11:11 "And behold, at that moment three men appeared before the house in which we were [staying,] having been sent to me from Caesarea.
44Ac 11:12 "And the Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings. And these six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.
44Ac 11:13 "And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, 'Send to Joppa, and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;
44Ac 11:14 and he shall speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household. '
44Ac 11:15 "And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as [ He did] upon us at the beginning.
44Ac 11:16 "And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44Ac 11:17 "If God therefore gave to them the same gift as [He gave] to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"
44Ac 11:18 And when they heard this, they quieted down, and glorified God, saying, "Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance [that leads] to life."
44Ac 11:19 So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.
44Ac 11:20 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and [began] speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
44Ac 11:22 And the news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 Then when he had come and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and [began] to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain [true] to the Lord;
44Ac 11:24 for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord.
44Ac 11:25 And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;
44Ac 11:26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came about that for an entire year they met with the church, and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
44Ac 11:27 Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and [began] to indicate by the Spirit that there would certainly be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the [reign] of Claudius.
44Ac 11:29 And in the proportion that any of the disciples had means, each of them determined to send [a contribution] for the relief of the brethren living in Judea.
44Ac 11:30 And this they did, sending it in charge of Barnabas and Saul to the elders.
44Ac 12:1 Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church, in order to mistreat them.
44Ac 12:2 And he had James the brother of John put to death with a sword.
44Ac 12:3 And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
44Ac 12:4 And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.
44Ac 12:6 And on the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.
44Ac 12:7 And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and roused him, saying, "Get up quickly." And his chains fell off his hands.
44Ac 12:8 And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he *said to him," Wrap your cloak around you and follow me. "
44Ac 12:9 And he went out and continued to follow, and he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
44Ac 12:10 And when they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.
44Ac 12:11 And when Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
44Ac 12:12 And when he realized [this,] he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
44Ac 12:13 And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer.
44Ac 12:14 And when she recognized Peter's voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.
44Ac 12:15 And they said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. And they kept saying, "It is his angel."
44Ac 12:16 But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened [the door], they saw him and were amazed.
44Ac 12:17 But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Report these things to James and the brethren." And he departed and went to another place.
44Ac 12:18 Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers [as to] what could have become of Peter.
44Ac 12:19 And when Herod had searched for him and had not found him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away [to execution.] And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.
44Ac 12:20 Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one accord they came to him, and having won over Blastus the king's chamberlain, they were asking for peace, because their country was fed by the king's country.
44Ac 12:21 And on an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and [began] delivering an address to them.
44Ac 12:22 And the people kept crying out, "The voice of a god and not of a man!"
44Ac 12:23 And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44Ac 12:24 But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.
44Ac 12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with [them] John, who was also called Mark.
44Ac 13:1 Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was [there], prophets and teachers： Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
44Ac 13:2 And while they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44Ac 13:3 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
44Ac 13:4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 And when they reached Salamis, they [began] to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their helper.
44Ac 13:6 And when they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-jesus,
44Ac 13:7 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas the magician (for thus his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44Ac 13:9 But Saul, who was also [known as] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze upon him,
44Ac 13:10 and said, "You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?
44Ac 13:11 "And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a time." And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.
44Ac 13:12 Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
44Ac 13:13 Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
44Ac 13:14 But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
44Ac 13:15 And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets the synagogue officials sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it."
44Ac 13:16 And Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen：
44Ac 13:17 "The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.
44Ac 13:18 "And for a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.
44Ac 13:19 "And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance-- [all of which took] about four hundred and fifty years.
44Ac 13:20 "And after these things He gave [them] judges until Samuel the prophet.
44Ac 13:21 "And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
44Ac 13:22 "And after He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, 'I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.'
44Ac 13:23 "From the offspring of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
44Ac 13:24 after John had proclaimed before His coming a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
44Ac 13:25 "And while John was completing his course, he kept saying, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not [He.] But behold, one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
44Ac 13:26 "Brethren, sons of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, to us the word of this salvation is sent out.
44Ac 13:27 "For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, recognizing neither Him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled [these] by condemning [Him].
44Ac 13:28 "And though they found no ground for [putting Him to] death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.
44Ac 13:29 "And when they had carried out all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.
44Ac 13:30 "But God raised Him from the dead;
44Ac 13:31 and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.
44Ac 13:32 "And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,
44Ac 13:33 that God has fulfilled this [promise] to our children in that He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'THOU ART MY SON; TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN THEE.'
44Ac 13:34 "[And as for the fact] that He raised Him up from the dead, no more to return to decay, He has spoken in this way： 'I WILL GIVE YOU THE HOLY [and] SURE [blessings] OF DAVID.'
44Ac 13:35 "Therefore He also says in another [Psalm,] 'THOU WILT NOT ALLOW THY HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.'
44Ac 13:36 "For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid among his fathers, and underwent decay;
44Ac 13:37 but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.
44Ac 13:38 "Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
44Ac 13:39 and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.
44Ac 13:40 "Take heed therefore, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon [you]：
44Ac 13:41 'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.' "
44Ac 13:42 And as Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.
44Ac 13:43 Now when [the meeting of] the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.
44Ac 13:44 And the next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and [began] contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.
44Ac 13:46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
44Ac 13:47 "For thus the Lord has commanded us, 'I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU SHOULD BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.'"
44Ac 13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they [began] rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.
44Ac 13:49 And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews aroused the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
44Ac 13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet [in protest] against them and went to Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 14:1 And it came about that in Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together, and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.
44Ac 14:2 But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds of the Gentiles, and embittered them against the brethren.
44Ac 14:3 Therefore they spent a long time [there] speaking boldly [with reliance] upon the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by their hands.
44Ac 14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided; and some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
44Ac 14:5 And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,
44Ac 14:6 they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;
44Ac 14:7 and there they continued to preach the gospel.
44Ac 14:8 And at Lystra there was sitting a certain man, without strength in his feet, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.
44Ac 14:9 This man was listening to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze upon him, and had seen that he had faith to be made well,
44Ac 14:10 said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he leaped up and [began] to walk.
44Ac 14:11 And when the multitudes saw what Paul had done, they raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us."
44Ac 14:12 And they [began] calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
44Ac 14:13 And the priest of Zeus, whose [temple] was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
44Ac 14:14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out
44Ac 14:15 and saying, "Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you in order that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, WHO MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM.
44Ac 14:16 "And in the generations gone by He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;
44Ac 14:17 and yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness. "
44Ac 14:18 And [even] saying these things, they with difficulty restrained the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.
44Ac 14:19 But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won over the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
44Ac 14:20 But while the disciples stood around him, he arose and entered the city. And the next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.
44Ac 14:21 And after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
44Ac 14:22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and [saying,] "Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God."
44Ac 14:23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
44Ac 14:24 And they passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.
44Ac 14:25 And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;
44Ac 14:26 and from there they sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had accomplished.
44Ac 14:27 And when they had arrived and gathered the church together, they [ began] to report all things that God had done with them and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
44Ac 14:28 And they spent a long time with the disciples.
44Ac 15:1 And some men came down from Judea and [began] teaching the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 15:2 And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them, [the brethren] determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.
44Ac 15:3 Therefore, being sent on their way by the church, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and were bringing great joy to all the brethren.
44Ac 15:4 And when they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
44Ac 15:5 But certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, stood up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses."
44Ac 15:6 And the apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.
44Ac 15:7 And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
44Ac 15:8 "And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;
44Ac 15:9 and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
44Ac 15:10 "Now therefore why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
44Ac 15:11 "But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are."
44Ac 15:12 And all the multitude kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul as they were relating what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
44Ac 15:13 And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, "Brethren, listen to me.
44Ac 15:14 "Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.
44Ac 15:15 "And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,
44Ac 15:16 'AFTER THESE THINGS I will return, AND I WILL REBUILD THE TABERNACLE OF DAVID WHICH HAS FALLEN, AND I WILL REBUILD ITS RUINS, AND I WILL RESTORE IT,
44Ac 15:17 IN ORDER THAT THE REST OF MANKIND MAY SEEK THE LORD, AND ALL THE GENTILES WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME, '
44Ac 15:18 SAYS THE LORD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM OF OLD.
44Ac 15:19 "Therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,
44Ac 15:20 but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.
44Ac 15:21 "For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
44Ac 15:22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas-- Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,
44Ac 15:23 and they sent this letter by them, "The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.
44Ac 15:24 "Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with [their] words, unsettling your souls,
44Ac 15:25 it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
44Ac 15:26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 15:27 "Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word [of mouth].
44Ac 15:28 "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials：
44Ac 15:29 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell. "
44Ac 15:30 So, when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
44Ac 15:32 And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.
44Ac 15:33 And after they had spent time [there], they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out.
44Ac 15:34 {But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.}
44Ac 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others also, the word of the Lord.
44Ac 15:36 And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they are."
44Ac 15:37 And Barnabas was desirous of taking John, called Mark, along with them also.
44Ac 15:38 But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
44Ac 15:39 And there arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
44Ac 15:40 But Paul chose Silas and departed, being committed by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
44Ac 15:41 And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44Ac 16:1 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,
44Ac 16:2 and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 Now while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees, which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.
44Ac 16:6 And they passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
44Ac 16:7 and when they had come to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;
44Ac 16:8 and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
44Ac 16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night： a certain man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44Ac 16:10 And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44Ac 16:11 Therefore putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;
44Ac 16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a [Roman] colony; and we were staying in this city for some days.
44Ac 16:13 And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.
44Ac 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.
44Ac 16:15 And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.
44Ac 16:16 And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortunetelling.
44Ac 16:17 Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, "These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
44Ac 16:18 And she continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" And it came out at that very moment.
44Ac 16:19 But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,
44Ac 16:20 and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,
44Ac 16:21 and are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans. "
44Ac 16:22 And the crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them, and proceeded to order [them] to be beaten with rods.
44Ac 16:23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;
44Ac 16:24 and he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44Ac 16:25 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
44Ac 16:26 and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.
44Ac 16:27 And when the jailer had been roused out of sleep and had seen the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here!"
44Ac 16:29 And he called for lights and rushed in and, trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas,
44Ac 16:30 and after he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."
44Ac 16:32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.
44Ac 16:33 And he took them that [very] hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his [household.]
44Ac 16:34 And he brought them into his house and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.
44Ac 16:35 Now when day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen, saying, "Release those men."
44Ac 16:36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul, [saying,] "The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Now therefore, come out and go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us in public without trial, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now are they sending us away secretly? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out."
44Ac 16:38 And the policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates. And they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
44Ac 16:39 and they came and appealed to them, and when they had brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.
44Ac 16:40 And they went out of the prison and entered [the house of] Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.
44Ac 17:1 Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
44Ac 17:2 And according to Paul's custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
44Ac 17:3 explaining and giving evidence that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and [saying,] "This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ."
44Ac 17:4 And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a great multitude of the God-fearing Greeks and a number of the leading women.
44Ac 17:5 But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the people.
44Ac 17:6 And when they did not find them, they [began] dragging Jason and some brethren before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have come here also;
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has welcomed them, and they all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus. "
44Ac 17:8 And they stirred up the crowd and the city authorities who heard these things.
44Ac 17:9 And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the others, they released them.
44Ac 17:10 And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
44Ac 17:11 Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, [ to see] whether these things were so.
44Ac 17:12 Many of them therefore believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men.
44Ac 17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there likewise, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
44Ac 17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.
44Ac 17:15 Now those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
44Ac 17:16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was beholding the city full of idols.
44Ac 17:17 So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing [Gentiles,] and in the market place every day with those who happened to be present.
44Ac 17:18 And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. And some were saying, "What would this idle babbler wish to say?" Others, "He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,"-- because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
44Ac 17:19 And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming?
44Ac 17:20 "For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; we want to know therefore what these things mean."
44Ac 17:21 (Now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
44Ac 17:22 And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.
44Ac 17:23 "For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.
44Ac 17:24 "The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
44Ac 17:25 neither is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and all things;
44Ac 17:26 and He made from one, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed times, and the boundaries of their habitation,
44Ac 17:27 that they should seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;
44Ac 17:28 for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are His offspring.'
44Ac 17:29 "Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.
44Ac 17:30 "Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent,
44Ac 17:31 because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead. "
44Ac 17:32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some [began] to sneer, but others said, "We shall hear you again concerning this."
44Ac 17:33 So Paul went out of their midst.
44Ac 17:34 But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
44Ac 18:1 After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
44Ac 18:2 And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,
44Ac 18:3 and because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working; for by trade they were tent-makers.
44Ac 18:4 And he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 18:5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul [began] devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
44Ac 18:6 And when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood [be] upon your own heads! I am clean. From now on I shall go to the Gentiles."
44Ac 18:7 And he departed from there and went to the house of a certain man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
44Ac 18:8 And Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.
44Ac 18:9 And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, "Do not be afraid [any longer], but go on speaking and do not be silent;
44Ac 18:10 for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in this city. "
44Ac 18:11 And he settled [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
44Ac 18:12 But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
44Ac 18:13 saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
44Ac 18:14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;
44Ac 18:15 but if there are questions about words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to be a judge of these matters. "
44Ac 18:16 And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
44Ac 18:17 And they all took hold of Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and [began] beating him in front of the judgment seat. And Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.
44Ac 18:18 And Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.
44Ac 18:19 And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 And when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent,
44Ac 18:21 but taking leave of them and saying, "I will return to you again if God wills," he set sail from Ephesus.
44Ac 18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.
44Ac 18:23 And having spent some time [there,] he departed and passed successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44Ac 18:24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.
44Ac 18:25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;
44Ac 18:26 and he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
44Ac 18:27 And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he helped greatly those who had believed through grace;
44Ac 18:28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
44Ac 19:1 And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found some disciples,
44Ac 19:2 and he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they [said] to him, "No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."
44Ac 19:3 And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John's baptism."
44Ac 19:4 And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they [began] speaking with tongues and prophesying.
44Ac 19:7 And there were in all about twelve men.
44Ac 19:8 And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading [them] about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 19:11 And God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
44Ac 19:12 so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.
44Ac 19:13 But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
44Ac 19:14 And seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
44Ac 19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
44Ac 19:17 And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.
44Ac 19:18 Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.
44Ac 19:19 And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and [began] burning them in the sight of all; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
44Ac 19:20 So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
44Ac 19:21 Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44Ac 19:22 And having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
44Ac 19:23 And about that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way.
44Ac 19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen;
44Ac 19:25 these he gathered together with the workmen of similar [trades,] and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
44Ac 19:26 "And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods [at all.]
44Ac 19:27 "And not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship should even be dethroned from her magnificence."
44Ac 19:28 And when they heard [this] and were filled with rage, they [began] crying out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 And the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.
44Ac 19:30 And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
44Ac 19:31 And also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent to him and repeatedly urged him not to venture into the theater.
44Ac 19:32 So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together.
44Ac 19:33 And some of the crowd concluded [it was] Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward; and having motioned with his hand, Alexander was intending to make a defense to the assembly.
44Ac 19:34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a [single] outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:35 And after quieting the multitude, the town clerk *said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?
44Ac 19:36 "Since then these are undeniable facts, you ought to keep calm and to do nothing rash.
44Ac 19:37 "For you have brought these men [here] who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 "So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against any man, the courts are in session and proconsuls are [available]; let them bring charges against one another.
44Ac 19:39 "But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.
44Ac 19:40 "For indeed we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today's affair, since there is no [real] cause [for it]; and in this connection we shall be unable to account for this disorderly gathering."
44Ac 19:41 And after saying this he dismissed the assembly.
44Ac 20:1 And after the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he departed to go to Macedonia.
44Ac 20:2 And when he had gone through those districts and had given them much exhortation, he came to Greece.
44Ac 20:3 And [there] he spent three months, and when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, [the son] of Pyrrhus; and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
44Ac 20:5 But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
44Ac 20:6 And we sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days.
44Ac 20:7 And on the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul [began] talking to them, intending to depart the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.
44Ac 20:8 And there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
44Ac 20:9 And there was a certain young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor, and was picked up dead.
44Ac 20:10 But Paul went down and fell upon him and after embracing him, he said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
44Ac 20:11 And when he had gone [back] up, and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.
44Ac 20:12 And they took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.
44Ac 20:13 But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending from there to take Paul on board; for thus he had arranged it, intending himself to go by land.
44Ac 20:14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 And sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.
44Ac 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus in order that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
44Ac 20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
44Ac 20:18 And when they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,
44Ac 20:19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
44Ac 20:20 how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,
44Ac 20:21 solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 20:22 "And now, behold, bound in spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
44Ac 20:23 except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
44Ac 20:24 "But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to myself, in order that I may finish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
44Ac 20:25 "And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.
44Ac 20:26 "Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
44Ac 20:27 "For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
44Ac 20:28 "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.
44Ac 20:29 "I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;
44Ac 20:30 and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
44Ac 20:31 "Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.
44Ac 20:32 "And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build [you] up and to give [you] the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44Ac 20:33 "I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.
44Ac 20:34 "You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my [own] needs and to the men who were with me.
44Ac 20:35 "In everything I showed you that by working hard in this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
44Ac 20:37 And they [began] to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,
44Ac 20:38 grieving especially over the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they were accompanying him to the ship.
44Ac 21:1 And when it came about that we had parted from them and had set sail, we ran a straight course to Cos and the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara;
44Ac 21:2 and having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
44Ac 21:3 And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left, we kept sailing to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
44Ac 21:4 And after looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:5 And when it came about that our days there were ended, we departed and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until [we were] out of the city. And after kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another.
44Ac 21:6 Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
44Ac 21:7 And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for a day.
44Ac 21:8 And on the next day we departed and came to Caesarea; and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.
44Ac 21:9 Now this man had four virgin daughters who were prophetesses.
44Ac 21:10 And as we were staying there for some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says： 'In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 21:12 And when we had heard this, we as well as the local residents [began] begging him not to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 21:14 And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking, "The will of the Lord be done!"
44Ac 21:15 And after these days we got ready and started on our way up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 And [some] of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
44Ac 21:17 And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
44Ac 21:18 And now the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
44Ac 21:19 And after he had greeted them, he [began] to relate one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 And when they heard it they [began] glorifying God; and they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law;
44Ac 21:21 and they have been told about you, that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.
44Ac 21:22 "What, then, is [to be done]? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44Ac 21:23 "Therefore do this that we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
44Ac 21:24 take them and purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses in order that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things which they have been told about you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Law.
44Ac 21:25 "But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote, having decided that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication."
44Ac 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purifying himself along with them, went into the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the sacrifice was offered for each one of them.
44Ac 21:27 And when the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, [began] to stir up all the multitude and laid hands on him,
44Ac 21:28 crying out, "Men of Israel, come to our aid! This is the man who preaches to all men everywhere against our people, and the Law, and this place; and besides he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
44Ac 21:29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
44Ac 21:30 And all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together; and taking hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.
44Ac 21:31 And while they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the [Roman] cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
44Ac 21:32 And at once he took along [some] soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44Ac 21:33 Then the commander came up and took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he [began] asking who he was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 But among the crowd some were shouting one thing [and] some another, and when he could not find out the facts on account of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
44Ac 21:35 And when he got to the stairs, it so happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;
44Ac 21:36 for the multitude of the people kept following behind, crying out, " Away with him! "
44Ac 21:37 And as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" And he *said, "Do you know Greek?
44Ac 21:38 "Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"
44Ac 21:39 But Paul said, "I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; and I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
44Ac 21:40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
44Ac 22:1 "Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now [offer] to you."
44Ac 22:2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he *said,
44Ac 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, just as you all are today.
44Ac 22:4 "And I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,
44Ac 22:5 as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.
44Ac 22:6 "And it came about that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus about noontime, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,
44Ac 22:7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'
44Ac 22:8 "And I answered, 'Who art Thou, Lord?' And He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'
44Ac 22:9 "And those who were with me beheld the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
44Ac 22:10 "And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Arise and go on into Damascus; and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'
44Ac 22:11 "But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
44Ac 22:12 "And a certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the standard of the Law, [and] well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
44Ac 22:13 came to me, and standing near said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very time I looked up at him.
44Ac 22:14 "And he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear an utterance from His mouth.
44Ac 22:15 'For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 'And now why do you delay? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.'
44Ac 22:17 "And it came about when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,
44Ac 22:18 and I saw Him saying to me, 'Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'
44Ac 22:19 "And I said, 'Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in Thee.
44Ac 22:20 'And when the blood of Thy witness Stephen was being shed, I also was standing by approving, and watching out for the cloaks of those who were slaying him.'
44Ac 22:21 "And He said to me, 'Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 22:22 And they listened to him up to this statement, and [then] they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!"
44Ac 22:23 And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,
44Ac 22:24 the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, stating that he should be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.
44Ac 22:25 And when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"
44Ac 22:26 And when the centurion heard [this,] he went to the commander and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman."
44Ac 22:27 And the commander came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" And he said," Yes. "
44Ac 22:28 And the commander answered, "I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money." And Paul said, "But I was actually born [a citizen.]"
44Ac 22:29 Therefore those who were about to examine him immediately let go of him; and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had put him in chains.
44Ac 22:30 But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
44Ac 23:1 And Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, "Brethren, I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God up to this day."
44Ac 23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?"
44Ac 23:4 But the bystanders said, "Do you revile God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 And Paul said, "I was not aware, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK EVIL OF A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE.'"
44Ac 23:6 But perceiving that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, Paul [began] crying out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!"
44Ac 23:7 And as he said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.
44Ac 23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
44Ac 23:9 And there arose a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and [began] to argue heatedly, saying, "We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44Ac 23:10 And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.
44Ac 23:11 But on the night [immediately] following, the Lord stood at his side and said, "Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also."
44Ac 23:12 And when it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
44Ac 23:13 And there were more than forty who formed this plot.
44Ac 23:14 And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 "Now, therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case by a more thorough investigation; and we for our part are ready to slay him before he comes near [the place.]"
44Ac 23:16 But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.
44Ac 23:17 And Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, "Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him."
44Ac 23:18 So he took him and led him to the commander and *said, "Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to lead this young man to you since he has something to tell you."
44Ac 23:19 And the commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, [began] to inquire of him privately, "What is it that you have to report to me?"
44Ac 23:20 And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.
44Ac 23:21 "So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait for him who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they slay him; and now they are ready and waiting for the promise from you."
44Ac 23:22 Therefore the commander let the young man go, instructing him, "Tell no one that you have notified me of these things."
44Ac 23:23 And he called to him two of the centurions, and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen."
44Ac 23:24 [They were] also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
44Ac 23:25 And he wrote a letter having this form：
44Ac 23:26 "Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.
44Ac 23:27 "When this man was arrested by the Jews and was about to be slain by them, I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
44Ac 23:28 "And wanting to ascertain the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Council;
44Ac 23:29 and I found him to be accused over questions about their Law, but under no accusation deserving death or imprisonment.
44Ac 23:30 "And when I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you."
44Ac 23:31 So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
44Ac 23:32 But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.
44Ac 23:33 And when these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
44Ac 23:34 And when he had read it, he asked from what province he was; and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will give you a hearing after your accusers arrive also," giving orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.
44Ac 24:1 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with a certain attorney [named] Tertullus; and they brought charges to the governor against Paul.
44Ac 24:2 And after [Paul] had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying [to the governor], "Since we have through you attained much peace, and since by your providence reforms are being carried out for this nation,
44Ac 24:3 we acknowledge [this] in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
44Ac 24:4 "But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us, by your kindness, a brief hearing.
44Ac 24:5 "For we have found this man a real pest and a fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
44Ac 24:6 "And he even tried to desecrate the temple; and then we arrested him. {And we wanted to judge him according to our own Law.
44Ac 24:7 "But Lysias the commander came along, and with much violence took him out of our hands,
44Ac 24:8 ordering his accusers to come before you.} And by examining him yourself concerning all these matters, you will be able to ascertain the things of which we accuse him. "
44Ac 24:9 And the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.
44Ac 24:10 And when the governor had nodded for him to speak, Paul responded： "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I cheerfully make my defense,
44Ac 24:11 since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
44Ac 24:12 "And neither in the temple, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city [itself] did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot.
44Ac 24:13 "Nor can they prove to you [the charges] of which they now accuse me.
44Ac 24:14 "But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law, and that is written in the Prophets;
44Ac 24:15 having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
44Ac 24:16 "In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a blameless conscience [both] before God and before men.
44Ac 24:17 "Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings;
44Ac 24:18 in which they found me [occupied] in the temple, having been purified, without [any] crowd or uproar. But [there were] certain Jews from Asia--
44Ac 24:19 who ought to have been present before you, and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.
44Ac 24:20 "Or else let these men themselves tell what misdeed they found when I stood before the Council,
44Ac 24:21 other than for this one statement which I shouted out while standing among them, 'For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.' "
44Ac 24:22 But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."
44Ac 24:23 And he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and [yet] have [some] freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him.
44Ac 24:24 But some days later, Felix arrived with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him [speak] about faith in Christ Jesus.
44Ac 24:25 And as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, "Go away for the present, and when I find time, I will summon you."
44Ac 24:26 At the same time too, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul; therefore he also used to send for him quite often and converse with him.
44Ac 24:27 But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wishing to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul imprisoned.
44Ac 25:1 Festus therefore, having arrived in the province, three days later went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
44Ac 25:2 And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews brought charges against Paul; and they were urging him,
44Ac 25:3 requesting a concession against Paul, that he might have him brought to Jerusalem ([at the same time,] setting an ambush to kill him on the way).
44Ac 25:4 Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself was about to leave shortly.
44Ac 25:5 "Therefore," he *said, "let the influential men among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him."
44Ac 25:6 And after he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
44Ac 25:7 And after he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him which they could not prove;
44Ac 25:8 while Paul said in his own defense, "I have committed no offense either against the Law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."
44Ac 25:9 But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me on these [ charges]? "
44Ac 25:10 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to [the] Jews, as you also very well know.
44Ac 25:11 "If then I am a wrongdoer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is [true] of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar."
44Ac 25:12 Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go."
44Ac 25:13 Now when several days had elapsed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and paid their respects to Festus.
44Ac 25:14 And while they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
44Ac 25:15 and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation upon him.
44Ac 25:16 "And I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face, and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.
44Ac 25:17 "And so after they had assembled here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal, and ordered the man to be brought.
44Ac 25:18 "And when the accusers stood up, they [began] bringing charges against him not of such crimes as I was expecting;
44Ac 25:19 but they [simply] had some points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
44Ac 25:20 "And being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.
44Ac 25:21 "But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I send him to Caesar."
44Ac 25:22 And Agrippa [said] to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," he *said, "you shall hear him."
44Ac 25:23 And so, on the next day when Agrippa had come together with Bernice, amid great pomp, and had entered the auditorium accompanied by the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
44Ac 25:24 And Festus *said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present with us, you behold this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any longer.
44Ac 25:25 "But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
44Ac 25:26 "Yet I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you [all] and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.
44Ac 25:27 "For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to indicate also the charges against him."
44Ac 26:1 And Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and [proceeded] to make his defense：
44Ac 26:2 "In regard to all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense before you today;
44Ac 26:3 especially because you are an expert in all customs and questions among [the] Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44Ac 26:4 "So then, all Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my [own] nation and at Jerusalem;
44Ac 26:5 since they have known about me for a long time previously, if they are willing to testify, that I lived [as] a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion.
44Ac 26:6 "And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
44Ac 26:7 [the promise] to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve [God] night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.
44Ac 26:8 "Why is it considered incredible among you [people] if God does raise the dead?
44Ac 26:9 "So then, I thought to myself that I had to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44Ac 26:10 "And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote against them.
44Ac 26:11 "And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged at them, I kept pursuing them even to foreign cities.
44Ac 26:12 "While thus engaged as I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
44Ac 26:13 at midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining all around me and those who were journeying with me.
44Ac 26:14 "And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44Ac 26:15 "And I said, 'Who art Thou, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 26:16 'But arise, and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you;
44Ac 26:17 delivering you from the [Jewish] people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,
44Ac 26:18 to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, in order that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. '
44Ac 26:19 "Consequently, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision,
44Ac 26:20 but [kept] declaring both to those of Damascus first, and [also] at Jerusalem and [then] throughout all the region of Judea, and [even] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
44Ac 26:21 "For this reason [some] Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death.
44Ac 26:22 "And so, having obtained help from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, stating nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said was going to take place;
44Ac 26:23 that the Christ was to suffer, [and] that by reason of [His] resurrection from the dead He should be the first to proclaim light both to the [Jewish] people and to the Gentiles. "
44Ac 26:24 And while [Paul] was saying this in his defense, Festus *said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind! [Your] great learning is driving you mad."
44Ac 26:25 But Paul *said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober truth.
44Ac 26:26 "For the king knows about these matters, and I speak to him also with confidence, since I am persuaded that none of these things escape his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.
44Ac 26:27 "King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you do."
44Ac 26:28 And Agrippa [replied] to Paul, "In a short time you will persuade me to become a Christian."
44Ac 26:29 And Paul [said,] "I would to God, that whether in a short or long time, not only you, but also all who hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these chains."
44Ac 26:30 And the king arose and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,
44Ac 26:31 and when they had drawn aside, they [began] talking to one another, saying, "This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment."
44Ac 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44Ac 27:1 And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they proceeded to deliver Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.
44Ac 27:2 And embarking in an Adramyttian ship, which was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.
44Ac 27:3 And the next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.
44Ac 27:4 And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
44Ac 27:5 And when we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.
44Ac 27:7 And when we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us [to go] farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;
44Ac 27:8 and with difficulty sailing past it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul [began] to admonish them,
44Ac 27:10 and said to them, "Men, I perceive that the voyage will certainly be [attended] with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44Ac 27:11 But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship, than by what was being said by Paul.
44Ac 27:12 And because the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter [there.]
44Ac 27:13 And when a moderate south wind came up, supposing that they had gained their purpose, they weighed anchor and [began] sailing along Crete, close [inshore.]
44Ac 27:14 But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called Euraquilo;
44Ac 27:15 and when the ship was caught [in it,] and could not face the wind, we gave way [to it,] and let ourselves be driven along.
44Ac 27:16 And running under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get the [ship's] boat under control.
44Ac 27:17 And after they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on [the shallows] of Syrtis, they let down the sea anchor, and so let themselves be driven along.
44Ac 27:18 The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;
44Ac 27:19 and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
44Ac 27:20 And since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing [us,] from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.
44Ac 27:21 And when they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up in their midst and said, "Men, you ought to have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete, and incurred this damage and loss.
44Ac 27:22 "And [yet] now I urge you to keep up your courage, for there shall be no loss of life among you, but [only] of the ship.
44Ac 27:23 "For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,
44Ac 27:24 saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.'
44Ac 27:25 "Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God, that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.
44Ac 27:26 "But we must run aground on a certain island."
44Ac 27:27 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors [began] to surmise that they were approaching some land.
44Ac 27:28 And they took soundings, and found [it to be] twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took another sounding and found [it to be] fifteen fathoms.
44Ac 27:29 And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak.
44Ac 27:30 And as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship, and had let down the [ship's] boat into the sea, on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,
44Ac 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these men remain in the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved."
44Ac 27:32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the [ship's] boat, and let it fall away.
44Ac 27:33 And until the day was about to dawn, Paul was encouraging them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing.
44Ac 27:34 "Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your preservation; for not a hair from the head of any of you shall perish."
44Ac 27:35 And having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he broke it and began to eat.
44Ac 27:36 And all of them were encouraged, and they themselves also took food.
44Ac 27:37 And all of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons.
44Ac 27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they [began] to lighten the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea.
44Ac 27:39 And when day came, they could not recognize the land; but they did observe a certain bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could.
44Ac 27:40 And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they were heading for the beach.
44Ac 27:41 But striking a reef where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern [began] to be broken up by the force [of the waves.]
44Ac 27:42 And the soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, that none [of them] should swim away and escape;
44Ac 27:43 but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,
44Ac 27:44 and the rest [should follow], some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. And thus it happened that they all were brought safely to land.
44Ac 28:1 And when they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.
44Ac 28:2 And the natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.
44Ac 28:3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
44Ac 28:4 And when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they [ began] saying to one another, "Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
44Ac 28:5 However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.
44Ac 28:6 But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and [began] to say that he was a god.
44Ac 28:7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days.
44Ac 28:8 And it came about that the father of Publius was lying [in bed] afflicted with [recurrent] fever and dysentery; and Paul went in [to see] him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.
44Ac 28:9 And after this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured.
44Ac 28:10 And they also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied [us] with all we needed.
44Ac 28:11 And at the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.
44Ac 28:12 And after we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
44Ac 28:13 And from there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
44Ac 28:14 There we found [some] brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome.
44Ac 28:15 And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
44Ac 28:16 And when we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.
44Ac 28:17 And it happened that after three days he called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they had come together, he [began] saying to them, "Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people, or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
44Ac 28:18 "And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.
44Ac 28:19 "But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; not that I had any accusation against my nation.
44Ac 28:20 "For this reason therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel."
44Ac 28:21 And they said to him, "We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.
44Ac 28:22 "But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere."
44Ac 28:23 And when they had set a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God, and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.
44Ac 28:24 And some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe.
44Ac 28:25 And when they did not agree with one another, they [began] leaving after Paul had spoken one [parting] word, "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,
44Ac 28:26 saying, 'GO TO THIS PEOPLE AND SAY, "YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; AND YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;
44Ac 28:27 FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR, AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES; LEST THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN, AND I SHOULD HEAL THEM. "'
44Ac 28:28 "Let it be known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also listen."
44Ac 28:29 {And when he had spoken these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.}
44Ac 28:30 And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters, and was welcoming all who came to him,
44Ac 28:31 preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.

45Rm 1:1 Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called [as] an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
45Rm 1:2 which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
45Rm 1:3 concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David according to the flesh,
45Rm 1:4 who was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,
45Rm 1:5 through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about [ the] obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake,
45Rm 1:6 among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
45Rm 1:7 to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called [as] saints： Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.
45Rm 1:9 For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the [preaching of the] gospel of His Son, is my witness [as to] how unceasingly I make mention of you,
45Rm 1:10 always in my prayers making request, if perhaps now at last by the will of God I may succeed in coming to you.
45Rm 1:11 For I long to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, that you may be established;
45Rm 1:12 that is, that I may be encouraged together with you [while] among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.
45Rm 1:13 And I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned to come to you (and have been prevented thus far) in order that I might obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
45Rm 1:14 I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
45Rm 1:15 Thus, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
45Rm 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
45Rm 1:17 For in it [the] righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "BUT THE RIGHTEOUS [man] SHALL LIVE BY FAITH."
45Rm 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
45Rm 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.
45Rm 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.
45Rm 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God, or give thanks; but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
45Rm 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,
45Rm 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
45Rm 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, that their bodies might be dishonored among them.
45Rm 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
45Rm 1:26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,
45Rm 1:27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.
45Rm 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,
45Rm 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; [they are] gossips,
45Rm 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
45Rm 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;
45Rm 1:32 and, although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
45Rm 2:1 Therefore you are without excuse, every man [of you] who passes judgment, for in that you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
45Rm 2:2 And we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
45Rm 2:3 And do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment upon those who practice such things and do the same [yourself,] that you will escape the judgment of God?
45Rm 2:4 Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?
45Rm 2:5 But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
45Rm 2:6 who WILL RENDER TO EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS：
45Rm 2:7 to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;
45Rm 2:8 but to those who are selfishly ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.
45Rm 2:9 [There will be] tribulation and distress for every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,
45Rm 2:10 but glory and honor and peace to every man who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
45Rm 2:11 For there is no partiality with God.
45Rm 2:12 For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law; and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;
45Rm 2:13 for not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.
45Rm 2:14 For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,
45Rm 2:15 in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,
45Rm 2:16 on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.
45Rm 2:17 But if you bear the name "Jew," and rely upon the Law, and boast in God,
45Rm 2:18 and know [His] will, and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law,
45Rm 2:19 and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
45Rm 2:20 a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,
45Rm 2:21 you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one should not steal, do you steal?
45Rm 2:22 You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45Rm 2:23 You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God?
45Rm 2:24 For "THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU," just as it is written.
45Rm 2:25 For indeed circumcision is of value, if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
45Rm 2:26 If therefore the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
45Rm 2:27 And will not he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter [of the Law] and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law?
45Rm 2:28 For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.
45Rm 2:29 But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.
45Rm 3:1 Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
45Rm 3:2 Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
45Rm 3:3 What then? If some did not believe, their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?
45Rm 3:4 May it never be! Rather, let God be found true, though every man [be found] a liar, as it is written, "THAT THOU MIGHTEST BE JUSTIFIED IN THY WORDS, AND MIGHTEST PREVAIL WHEN THOU ART JUDGED."
45Rm 3:5 But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is He? (I am speaking in human terms.)
45Rm 3:6 May it never be! For otherwise how will God judge the world?
45Rm 3:7 But if through my lie the truth of God abounded to His glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?
45Rm 3:8 And why not [say] (as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil that good may come"? Their condemnation is just.
45Rm 3:9 What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
45Rm 3:10 as it is written, "THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
45Rm 3:11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;
45Rm 3:12 ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE. "
45Rm 3:13 "THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING," "THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS";
45Rm 3:14 "WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS";
45Rm 3:15 "THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,
45Rm 3:16 DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,
45Rm 3:17 AND THE PATH OF PEACE HAVE THEY NOT KNOWN. "
45Rm 3:18 "THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES."
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may become accountable to God;
45Rm 3:20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law [comes] the knowledge of sin.
45Rm 3:21 But now apart from the Law [the] righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
45Rm 3:22 even [the] righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;
45Rm 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45Rm 3:24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;
45Rm 3:25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. [This was] to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;
45Rm 3:26 for the demonstration, [I say,] of His righteousness at the present time, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.
45Rm 3:28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.
45Rm 3:29 Or is God [the God] of Jews only? Is He not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
45Rm 3:30 since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.
45Rm 3:31 Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.
45Rm 4:1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?
45Rm 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about; but not before God.
45Rm 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? "AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
45Rm 4:4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not reckoned as a favor, but as what is due.
45Rm 4:5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness,
45Rm 4:6 just as David also speaks of the blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works：
45Rm 4:7 "BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED.
45Rm 4:8 "BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT."
45Rm 4:9 Is this blessing then upon the circumcised, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say, "FAITH WAS RECKONED TO ABRAHAM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS."
45Rm 4:10 How then was it reckoned? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised;
45Rm 4:11 and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be reckoned to them,
45Rm 4:12 and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.
45Rm 4:13 For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.
45Rm 4:14 For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified;
45Rm 4:15 for the Law brings about wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there violation.
45Rm 4:16 For this reason [it is] by faith, that [it might be] in accordance with grace, in order that the promise may be certain to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
45Rm 4:17 (as it is written, "A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU") in the sight of Him whom he believed, [even] God, who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.
45Rm 4:18 In hope against hope he believed, in order that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, "SO SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE."
45Rm 4:19 And without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb;
45Rm 4:20 yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,
45Rm 4:21 and being fully assured that what He had promised, He was able also to perform.
45Rm 4:22 Therefore also IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
45Rm 4:23 Now not for his sake only was it written, that it was reckoned to him,
45Rm 4:24 but for our sake also, to whom it will be reckoned, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
45Rm 4:25 [He] who was delivered up because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.
45Rm 5:1 Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
45Rm 5:2 through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.
45Rm 5:3 And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;
45Rm 5:4 and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;
45Rm 5:5 and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
45Rm 5:6 For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
45Rm 5:7 For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
45Rm 5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
45Rm 5:9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath [of God] through Him.
45Rm 5:10 For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
45Rm 5:11 And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
45Rm 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--
45Rm 5:13 for until the Law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
45Rm 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.
45Rm 5:15 But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.
45Rm 5:16 And the gift is not like [that which came] through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment [arose] from one [transgression] resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift [arose] from many transgressions resulting in justification.
45Rm 5:17 For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.
45Rm 5:19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 And the Law came in that the transgression might increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
45Rm 5:21 that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace might increase?
45Rm 6:2 May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it?
45Rm 6:3 Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
45Rm 6:4 Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.
45Rm 6:5 For if we have become united with [Him] in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall be also [in the likeness] of His resurrection,
45Rm 6:6 knowing this, that our old self was crucified with [Him,] that our body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin;
45Rm 6:7 for he who has died is freed from sin.
45Rm 6:8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
45Rm 6:9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.
45Rm 6:10 For the death that He died, He died to sin, once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.
45Rm 6:11 Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts,
45Rm 6:13 and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.
45Rm 6:14 For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law, but under grace.
45Rm 6:15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!
45Rm 6:16 Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone [as] slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?
45Rm 6:17 But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed,
45Rm 6:18 and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.
45Rm 6:19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members [as] slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in [further] lawlessness, so now present your members [as] slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
45Rm 6:20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
45Rm 6:21 Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.
45Rm 6:22 But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.
45Rm 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 7:1 Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?
45Rm 7:2 For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.
45Rm 7:3 So then if, while her husband is living, she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
45Rm 7:4 Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit for God.
45Rm 7:5 For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were [aroused] by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.
45Rm 7:6 But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.
45Rm 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, "YOU SHALL NOT COVET."
45Rm 7:8 But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin [is] dead.
45Rm 7:9 And I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died;
45Rm 7:10 and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;
45Rm 7:11 for sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
45Rm 7:12 So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
45Rm 7:13 Therefore did that which is good become [a cause of] death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
45Rm 7:14 For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.
45Rm 7:15 For that which I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I [would] like to [do,] but I am doing the very thing I hate.
45Rm 7:16 But if I do the very thing I do not wish [to do], I agree with the Law, [confessing] that it is good.
45Rm 7:17 So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which indwells me.
45Rm 7:18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the wishing is present in me, but the doing of the good [is] not.
45Rm 7:19 For the good that I wish, I do not do; but I practice the very evil that I do not wish.
45Rm 7:20 But if I am doing the very thing I do not wish, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
45Rm 7:21 I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wishes to do good.
45Rm 7:22 For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,
45Rm 7:23 but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind, and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.
45Rm 7:24 Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?
45Rm 7:25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.
45Rm 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
45Rm 8:3 For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God [did:] sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and [as an offering] for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,
45Rm 8:4 in order that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
45Rm 8:5 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
45Rm 8:6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,
45Rm 8:7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able [to do so];
45Rm 8:8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
45Rm 8:9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
45Rm 8:10 And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
45Rm 8:11 But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
45Rm 8:12 So then, brethren, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh--
45Rm 8:13 for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
45Rm 8:14 For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
45Rm 8:15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Abba! Father!"
45Rm 8:16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
45Rm 8:17 and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with [Him] in order that we may also be glorified with [Him.]
45Rm 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
45Rm 8:19 For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.
45Rm 8:20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope
45Rm 8:21 that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
45Rm 8:22 For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.
45Rm 8:23 And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for [our] adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.
45Rm 8:24 For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one also hope for what he sees?
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.
45Rm 8:26 And in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for [ us] with groanings too deep for words;
45Rm 8:27 and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to [the will of] God.
45Rm 8:28 And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to [His] purpose.
45Rm 8:29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined [to become] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren;
45Rm 8:30 and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.
45Rm 8:31 What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [ is] against us?
45Rm 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
45Rm 8:33 Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who justifies;
45Rm 8:34 who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
45Rm 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
45Rm 8:36 Just as it is written, "FOR THY SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED."
45Rm 8:37 But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
45Rm 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 9:1 I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,
45Rm 9:2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
45Rm 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed, [separated] from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
45Rm 9:4 who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the [temple] service and the promises,
45Rm 9:5 whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
45Rm 9:6 But [it is] not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are [descended] from Israel;
45Rm 9:7 neither are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but： "THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED."
45Rm 9:8 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
45Rm 9:9 For this is a word of promise： "AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON."
45Rm 9:10 And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived [twins] by one man, our father Isaac;
45Rm 9:11 for though [the twins] were not yet born, and had not done anything good or bad, in order that God's purpose according to [His] choice might stand, not because of works, but because of Him who calls,
45Rm 9:12 it was said to her, "THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER."
45Rm 9:13 Just as it is written, "JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED."
45Rm 9:14 What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!
45Rm 9:15 For He says to Moses, "I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION."
45Rm 9:16 So then it [does] not [depend] on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH."
45Rm 9:18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
45Rm 9:19 You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?"
45Rm 9:20 On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it?
45Rm 9:21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use, and another for common use?
45Rm 9:22 What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
45Rm 9:23 And [He did so] in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,
45Rm 9:24 [even] us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.
45Rm 9:25 As He says also in Hosea, "I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, 'MY PEOPLE,' AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, 'BELOVED.'"
45Rm 9:26 "AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, ' YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE, 'THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD. "
45Rm 9:27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;
45Rm 9:28 FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD UPON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY. "
45Rm 9:29 And just as Isaiah foretold, "EXCEPT THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME AS SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH."
45Rm 9:30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
45Rm 9:31 but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at [that] law.
45Rm 9:32 Why? Because [they did] not [pursue it] by faith, but as though [it were] by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
45Rm 9:33 just as it is written, "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
45Rm 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for [their] salvation.
45Rm 10:2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
45Rm 10:3 For not knowing about God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
45Rm 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
45Rm 10:5 For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
45Rm 10:6 But the righteousness based on faith speaks thus, "DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, 'WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?' (that is, to bring Christ down),
45Rm 10:7 or 'WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). "
45Rm 10:8 But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"-- that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,
45Rm 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus [as] Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved;
45Rm 10:10 for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
45Rm 10:11 For the Scripture says, "WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
45Rm 10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same [Lord] is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call upon Him;
45Rm 10:13 for "WHOEVER WILL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED."
45Rm 10:14 How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
45Rm 10:15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GLAD TIDINGS OF GOOD THINGS!"
45Rm 10:16 However, they did not all heed the glad tidings; for Isaiah says, "LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?"
45Rm 10:17 So faith [comes] from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
45Rm 10:18 But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; "THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD."
45Rm 10:19 But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? At the first Moses says, "I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU."
45Rm 10:20 And Isaiah is very bold and says, "I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO SOUGHT ME NOT, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME."
45Rm 10:21 But as for Israel He says, "ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE."
45Rm 11:1 I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in [the passage about] Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
45Rm 11:3 "Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED THY PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN THINE ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE."
45Rm 11:4 But what is the divine response to him? "I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL. "
45Rm 11:5 In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to [God's] gracious choice.
45Rm 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
45Rm 11:7 What then? That which Israel is seeking for, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
45Rm 11:8 just as it is written, "GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY."
45Rm 11:9 And David says, "LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.
45Rm 11:10 "LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER."
45Rm 11:11 I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.
45Rm 11:12 Now if their transgression be riches for the world and their failure be riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!
45Rm 11:13 But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
45Rm 11:14 if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For if their rejection be the reconciliation of the world, what will [their] acceptance be but life from the dead?
45Rm 11:16 And if the first piece [of dough] be holy, the lump is also; and if the root be holy, the branches are too.
45Rm 11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,
45Rm 11:18 do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, [ remember that] it is not you who supports the root, but the root [supports] you.
45Rm 11:19 You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
45Rm 11:20 Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
45Rm 11:21 for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.
45Rm 11:22 Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God's kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
45Rm 11:24 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these who are the natural [branches] be grafted into their own olive tree?
45Rm 11:25 For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery, lest you be wise in your own estimation, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles has come in;
45Rm 11:26 and thus all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, "THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB."
45Rm 11:27 "AND THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS."
45Rm 11:28 From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of [God's] choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;
45Rm 11:29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
45Rm 11:30 For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
45Rm 11:31 so these also now have been disobedient, in order that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.
45Rm 11:32 For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all.
45Rm 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
45Rm 11:34 For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?
45Rm 11:35 Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
45Rm 11:36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him [be] the glory forever. Amen.
45Rm 12:1 I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, [which is] your spiritual service of worship.
45Rm 12:2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
45Rm 12:3 For through the grace given to me I say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
45Rm 12:4 For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,
45Rm 12:5 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
45Rm 12:6 And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, [let each exercise them accordingly]： if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;
45Rm 12:7 if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;
45Rm 12:8 or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
45Rm 12:9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor;
45Rm 12:11 not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;
45Rm 12:12 rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,
45Rm 12:13 contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and curse not.
45Rm 12:15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
45Rm 12:16 Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.
45Rm 12:17 Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.
45Rm 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
45Rm 12:19 Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath [of God,] for it is written, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY," says the Lord.
45Rm 12:20 "BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS UPON HIS HEAD. "
45Rm 12:21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45Rm 13:1 Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
45Rm 13:2 Therefore he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
45Rm 13:3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same;
45Rm 13:4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.
45Rm 13:5 Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
45Rm 13:6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for [rulers] are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
45Rm 13:7 Render to all what is due them： tax to whom tax [is due;] custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
45Rm 13:8 Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled [the] law.
45Rm 13:9 For this, "YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET," and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF."
45Rm 13:10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; love therefore is the fulfillment of [the] law.
45Rm 13:11 And this [do,] knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.
45Rm 13:12 The night is almost gone, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45Rm 13:13 Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy.
45Rm 13:14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to [its] lusts.
45Rm 14:1 Now accept the one who is weak in faith, [but] not for [the purpose of] passing judgment on his opinions.
45Rm 14:2 One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables [only.]
45Rm 14:3 Let not him who eats regard with contempt him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and stand he will, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
45Rm 14:5 One man regards one day above another, another regards every day [alike.] Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind.
45Rm 14:6 He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.
45Rm 14:7 For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself;
45Rm 14:8 for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.
45Rm 14:9 For to this end Christ died and lived [again], that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
45Rm 14:10 But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.
45Rm 14:11 For it is written, "AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD."
45Rm 14:12 So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
45Rm 14:13 Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this-- not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way.
45Rm 14:14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
45Rm 14:15 For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.
45Rm 14:16 Therefore do not let what is for you a good thing be spoken of as evil;
45Rm 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 14:18 For he who in this [way] serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
45Rm 14:19 So then let us pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.
45Rm 14:20 Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives offense.
45Rm 14:21 It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or [to do anything] by which your brother stumbles.
45Rm 14:22 The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
45Rm 14:23 But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because [his eating is] not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.
45Rm 15:1 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not [just] please ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.
45Rm 15:3 For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, " THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED THEE FELL UPON ME."
45Rm 15:4 For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
45Rm 15:5 Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus;
45Rm 15:6 that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 15:7 Wherefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.
45Rm 15:8 For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises [given] to the fathers,
45Rm 15:9 and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, "THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO THEE AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO THY NAME."
45Rm 15:10 And again he says, "REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE."
45Rm 15:11 And again, "PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM."
45Rm 15:12 And again Isaiah says, "THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE."
45Rm 15:13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:14 And concerning you, my brethren, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one another.
45Rm 15:15 But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,
45Rm 15:16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that [my] offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 Therefore in Christ Jesus I have found reason for boasting in things pertaining to God.
45Rm 15:18 For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,
45Rm 15:19 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
45Rm 15:20 And thus I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was [already] named, that I might not build upon another man's foundation;
45Rm 15:21 but as it is written, "THEY WHO HAD NO NEWS OF HIM SHALL SEE, AND THEY WHO HAVE NOT HEARD SHALL UNDERSTAND. "
45Rm 15:22 For this reason I have often been hindered from coming to you;
45Rm 15:23 but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you
45Rm 15:24 whenever I go to Spain-- for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while--
45Rm 15:25 but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints.
45Rm 15:26 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:27 Yes, they were pleased [to do so,] and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things.
45Rm 15:28 Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
45Rm 15:29 And I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
45Rm 15:30 Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
45Rm 15:31 that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and [that] my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;
45Rm 15:32 so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find [refreshing] rest in your company.
45Rm 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45Rm 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea;
45Rm 16:2 that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well.
45Rm 16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 16:4 who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;
45Rm 16:5 also [greet] the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia.
45Rm 16:6 Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the [ household] of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the [household] of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
45Rm 16:12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, workers in the Lord. Greet Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, a choice man in the Lord, also his mother and mine.
45Rm 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brethren with them.
45Rm 16:15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
45Rm 16:17 Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them.
45Rm 16:18 For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
45Rm 16:19 For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil.
45Rm 16:20 And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45Rm 16:21 Timothy my fellow worker greets you, and [so do] Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
45Rm 16:22 I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer greets you, and Quartus, the brother.
45Rm 16:24 {The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.}
45Rm 16:25 Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,
45Rm 16:26 but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, [leading] to obedience of faith;
45Rm 16:27 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be the glory forever. Amen.
46
461Co 1:1 Paul, called [as] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
461Co 1:2 to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their [Lord] and ours：
461Co 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:4 I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,
461Co 1:5 that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge,
461Co 1:6 even as the testimony concerning Christ was confirmed in you,
461Co 1:7 so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
461Co 1:8 who shall also confirm you to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:9 God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
461Co 1:10 Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.
461Co 1:11 For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's [people,] that there are quarrels among you.
461Co 1:12 Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, "I am of Paul," and "I of Apollos," and "I of Cephas," and "I of Christ."
461Co 1:13 Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 that no man should say you were baptized in my name.
461Co 1:16 Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any other.
461Co 1:17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, that the cross of Christ should not be made void.
461Co 1:18 For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
461Co 1:19 For it is written, "I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE, AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE."
461Co 1:20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
461Co 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not [come to] know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.
461Co 1:22 For indeed Jews ask for signs, and Greeks search for wisdom;
461Co 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness,
461Co 1:24 but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
461Co 1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
461Co 1:26 For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;
461Co 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,
461Co 1:28 and the base things of the world and the despised, God has chosen, the things that are not, that He might nullify the things that are,
461Co 1:29 that no man should boast before God.
461Co 1:30 But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,
461Co 1:31 that, just as it is written, "LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD."
461Co 2:1 And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
461Co 2:2 For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
461Co 2:3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
461Co 2:4 And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
461Co 2:5 that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
461Co 2:6 Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;
461Co 2:7 but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden [wisdom,] which God predestined before the ages to our glory;
461Co 2:8 [the wisdom] which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
461Co 2:9 but just as it is written, "THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND [which] HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM."
461Co 2:10 For to us God revealed [them] through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
461Co 2:11 For who among men knows the [thoughts] of a man except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so the [thoughts] of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
461Co 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God,
461Co 2:13 which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual [thoughts] with spiritual [words.]
461Co 2:14 But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.
461Co 2:15 But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no man.
461Co 2:16 For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE SHOULD INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.
461Co 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to babes in Christ.
461Co 3:2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able [ to receive it.] Indeed, even now you are not yet able,
461Co 3:3 for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?
461Co 3:4 For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not [mere] men?
461Co 3:5 What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave [opportunity] to each one.
461Co 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
461Co 3:7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.
461Co 3:8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
461Co 3:9 For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.
461Co 3:10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But let each man be careful how he builds upon it.
461Co 3:11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
461Co 3:12 Now if any man builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
461Co 3:13 each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is [to be] revealed with fire; and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
461Co 3:14 If any man's work which he has built upon it remains, he shall receive a reward.
461Co 3:15 If any man's work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.
461Co 3:16 Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?
461Co 3:17 If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.
461Co 3:18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, "[He is] THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS";
461Co 3:20 and again, "THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS."
461Co 3:21 So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you,
461Co 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you,
461Co 3:23 and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
461Co 4:1 Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
461Co 4:2 In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.
461Co 4:3 But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you, or by [any] human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself.
461Co 4:4 For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord.
461Co 4:5 Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, [but wait] until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of [men's] hearts; and then each man's praise will come to him from God.
461Co 4:6 Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to exceed what is written, in order that no one of you might become arrogant in behalf of one against the other.
461Co 4:7 For who regards you as superior? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
461Co 4:8 You are already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and [I] would indeed that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you.
461Co 4:9 For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
461Co 4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor.
461Co 4:11 To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, and are roughly treated, and are homeless;
461Co 4:12 and we toil, working with our own hands; when we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;
461Co 4:13 when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become as the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, [even] until now.
461Co 4:14 I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
461Co 4:15 For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet [you would] not [have] many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
461Co 4:16 I exhort you therefore, be imitators of me.
461Co 4:17 For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
461Co 4:18 Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.
461Co 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant, but their power.
461Co 4:20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.
461Co 4:21 What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and a spirit of gentleness?
461Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father's wife.
461Co 5:2 And you have become arrogant, and have not mourned instead, in order that the one who had done this deed might be removed from your midst.
461Co 5:3 For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present.
461Co 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
461Co 5:5 [I have decided] to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
461Co 5:6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump [of dough]?
461Co 5:7 Clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, just as you are [in fact] unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.
461Co 5:8 Let us therefore celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
461Co 5:9 I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;
461Co 5:10 I [did] not at all [mean] with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters; for then you would have to go out of the world.
461Co 5:11 But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he should be an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler-- not even to eat with such a one.
461Co 5:12 For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within [the church]?
461Co 5:13 But those who are outside, God judges. REMOVE THE WICKED MAN FROM AMONG YOURSELVES.
461Co 6:1 Does any one of you, when he has a case against his neighbor, dare to go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
461Co 6:2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you not competent [to constitute] the smallest law courts?
461Co 6:3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, matters of this life?
461Co 6:4 If then you have law courts dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?
461Co 6:5 I say [this] to your shame. [Is it] so, [that] there is not among you one wise man who will be able to decide between his brethren,
461Co 6:6 but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
461Co 6:7 Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
461Co 6:8 On the contrary, you yourselves wrong and defraud, and that [your] brethren.
461Co 6:9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,
461Co 6:10 nor thieves, nor [the] covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
461Co 6:11 And such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.
461Co 6:12 All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
461Co 6:13 Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food; but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.
461Co 6:14 Now God has not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power.
461Co 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? May it never be!
461Co 6:16 Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a harlot is one body [with her]? For He says, "THE TWO WILL BECOME ONE FLESH."
461Co 6:17 But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit [with Him.]
461Co 6:18 Flee immorality. Every [other] sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.
461Co 6:19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
461Co 6:20 For you have been bought with a price： therefore glorify God in your body.
461Co 7:1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
461Co 7:2 But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
461Co 7:3 Let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.
461Co 7:4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband [ does]; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife [does.]
461Co 7:5 Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 But this I say by way of concession, not of command.
461Co 7:7 Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.
461Co 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.
461Co 7:9 But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
461Co 7:10 But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband
461Co 7:11 (but if she does leave, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not send his wife away.
461Co 7:12 But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, let him not send her away.
461Co 7:13 And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, let her not send her husband away.
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
461Co 7:15 Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases,] but God has called us to peace.
461Co 7:16 For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
461Co 7:17 Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner let him walk. And thus I direct in all the churches.
461Co 7:18 Was any man called [already] circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
461Co 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but [what matters is] the keeping of the commandments of God.
461Co 7:20 Let each man remain in that condition in which he was called.
461Co 7:21 Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that.
461Co 7:22 For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is Christ's slave.
461Co 7:23 You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.
461Co 7:24 Brethren, let each man remain with God in that [condition] in which he was called.
461Co 7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no command of the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
461Co 7:26 I think then that this is good in view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
461Co 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
461Co 7:28 But if you should marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. Yet such will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.
461Co 7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none;
461Co 7:30 and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;
461Co 7:31 and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of this world is passing away.
461Co 7:32 But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
461Co 7:33 but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
461Co 7:34 and [his interests] are divided. And the woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
461Co 7:35 And this I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is seemly, and [to secure] undistracted devotion to the Lord.
461Co 7:36 But if any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin [daughter,] if she should be of full age, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry.
461Co 7:37 But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has authority over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter,] he will do well.
461Co 7:38 So then both he who gives his own virgin [daughter] in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
461Co 7:39 A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
461Co 7:40 But in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
461Co 8:1 Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.
461Co 8:2 If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know;
461Co 8:3 but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
461Co 8:4 Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is no God but one.
461Co 8:5 For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
461Co 8:6 yet for us there is [but] one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we [exist] for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we [exist] through Him.
461Co 8:7 However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat [food] as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
461Co 8:8 But food will not commend us to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.
461Co 8:9 But take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
461Co 8:10 For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
461Co 8:11 For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
461Co 8:12 And thus, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
461Co 8:13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, that I might not cause my brother to stumble.
461Co 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
461Co 9:2 If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
461Co 9:3 My defense to those who examine me is this：
461Co 9:4 Do we not have a right to eat and drink?
461Co 9:5 Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
461Co 9:6 Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?
461Co 9:7 Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
461Co 9:8 I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things?
461Co 9:9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, "YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING." God is not concerned about oxen, is He?
461Co 9:10 Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher [to thresh] in hope of sharing [the crops.]
461Co 9:11 If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we should reap material things from you?
461Co 9:12 If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
461Co 9:13 Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the [food] of the temple, [and] those who attend regularly to the altar have their share with the altar?
461Co 9:14 So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
461Co 9:15 But I have used none of these things. And I am not writing these things that it may be done so in my case; for it would be better for me to die than have any man make my boast an empty one.
461Co 9:16 For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.
461Co 9:17 For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
461Co 9:18 What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
461Co 9:19 For though I am free from all [men,] I have made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more.
461Co 9:20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law, though not being myself under the Law, that I might win those who are under the Law;
461Co 9:21 to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I might win those who are without law.
461Co 9:22 To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
461Co 9:23 And I do all things for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
461Co 9:24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but [only] one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.
461Co 9:25 And everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then [do it] to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
461Co 9:26 Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air;
461Co 9:27 but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.
461Co 10:1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
461Co 10:2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
461Co 10:3 and all ate the same spiritual food;
461Co 10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.
461Co 10:5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid low in the wilderness.
461Co 10:6 Now these things happened as examples for us, that we should not crave evil things, as they also craved.
461Co 10:7 And do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, " THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY. "
461Co 10:8 Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.
461Co 10:9 Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents.
461Co 10:10 Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
461Co 10:11 Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
461Co 10:12 Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
461Co 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.
461Co 10:14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
461Co 10:15 I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.
461Co 10:16 Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?
461Co 10:17 Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.
461Co 10:18 Look at the nation Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?
461Co 10:19 What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
461Co 10:20 [No,] but [I say] that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers in demons.
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
461Co 10:22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?
461Co 10:23 All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
461Co 10:24 Let no one seek his own [good,] but that of his neighbor.
461Co 10:25 Eat anything that is sold in the meat market, without asking questions for conscience' sake;
461Co 10:26 FOR THE EARTH IS THE Lord's, AND ALL IT CONTAINS.
461Co 10:27 If one of the unbelievers invites you, and you wish to go, eat anything that is set before you, without asking questions for conscience' sake.
461Co 10:28 But if anyone should say to you, "This is meat sacrificed to idols," do not eat [it,] for the sake of the one who informed [you,] and for conscience' sake;
461Co 10:29 I mean not your own conscience, but the other [man's]; for why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?
461Co 10:30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?
461Co 10:31 Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
461Co 10:32 Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God;
461Co 10:33 just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of the many, that they may be saved.
461Co 11:1 Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.
461Co 11:2 Now I praise you because you remember me in everything, and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.
461Co 11:3 But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.
461Co 11:4 Every man who has [something] on his head while praying or prophesying, disgraces his head.
461Co 11:5 But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying, disgraces her head; for she is one and the same with her whose head is shaved.
461Co 11:6 For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her cover her head.
461Co 11:7 For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
461Co 11:8 For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;
461Co 11:9 for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake.
461Co 11:10 Therefore the woman ought to have [a symbol of] authority on her head, because of the angels.
461Co 11:11 However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
461Co 11:12 For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man [has his birth] through the woman; and all things originate from God.
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves： is it proper for a woman to pray to God [with head] uncovered?
461Co 11:14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
461Co 11:15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
461Co 11:16 But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.
461Co 11:17 But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.
461Co 11:18 For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part, I believe it.
461Co 11:19 For there must also be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may have become evident among you.
461Co 11:20 Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper,
461Co 11:21 for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is hungry and another is drunk.
461Co 11:22 What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;
461Co 11:24 and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and said, "This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me."
461Co 11:25 In the same way [He took] the cup also, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink [it,] in remembrance of Me."
461Co 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.
461Co 11:27 Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
461Co 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
461Co 11:29 For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he does not judge the body rightly.
461Co 11:30 For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.
461Co 11:31 But if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.
461Co 11:32 But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.
461Co 11:33 So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
461Co 11:34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you may not come together for judgment. And the remaining matters I shall arrange when I come.
461Co 12:1 Now concerning spiritual [gifts,] brethren, I do not want you to be unaware.
461Co 12:2 You know that when you were pagans, [you were] led astray to the dumb idols, however you were led.
461Co 12:3 Therefore I make known to you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is accursed"; and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
461Co 12:4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
461Co 12:5 And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
461Co 12:6 And there are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all [persons.]
461Co 12:7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
461Co 12:8 For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
461Co 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
461Co 12:10 and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another [various] kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.
461Co 12:11 But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.
461Co 12:12 For even as the body is one and [yet] has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
461Co 12:13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
461Co 12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.
461Co 12:15 If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not [a part] of the body," it is not for this reason any the less [a part] of the body.
461Co 12:16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not [a part] of the body," it is not for this reason any the less [a part] of the body.
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
461Co 12:18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.
461Co 12:19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be?
461Co 12:20 But now there are many members, but one body.
461Co 12:21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; or again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;
461Co 12:23 and those [members] of the body, which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our unseemly [members come to] have more abundant seemliness,
461Co 12:24 whereas our seemly [members] have no need [of it.] But God has [so] composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that [member] which lacked,
461Co 12:25 that there should be no division in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care for one another.
461Co 12:26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
461Co 12:27 Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of it.
461Co 12:28 And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, [various] kinds of tongues.
461Co 12:29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not [workers of] miracles, are they?
461Co 12:30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?
461Co 12:31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.
461Co 13:1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
461Co 13:2 And if I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
461Co 13:3 And if I give all my possessions to feed [the poor,] and if I deliver my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.
461Co 13:4 Love is patient, love is kind, [and] is not jealous; love does not brag [and] is not arrogant,
461Co 13:5 does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong [suffered,]
461Co 13:6 does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
461Co 13:7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
461Co 13:8 Love never fails; but if [there are gifts of] prophecy, they will be done away; if [there are] tongues, they will cease; if [there is] knowledge, it will be done away.
461Co 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
461Co 13:10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I used to speak as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.
461Co 13:12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall know fully just as I also have been fully known.
461Co 13:13 But now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual [gifts,] but especially that you may prophesy.
461Co 14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; for no one understands, but in [his] spirit he speaks mysteries.
461Co 14:3 But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation.
461Co 14:4 One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church.
461Co 14:5 Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but [even] more that you would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edifying.
461Co 14:6 But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?
461Co 14:7 Yet [even] lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?
461Co 14:8 For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
461Co 14:9 So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.
461Co 14:10 There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no [kind] is without meaning.
461Co 14:11 If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me.
461Co 14:12 So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual [gifts,] seek to abound for the edification of the church.
461Co 14:13 Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
461Co 14:15 What is [the outcome] then? I shall pray with the spirit and I shall pray with the mind also; I shall sing with the spirit and I shall sing with the mind also.
461Co 14:16 Otherwise if you bless in the spirit [only,] how will the one who fills the place of the ungifted say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
461Co 14:17 For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.
461Co 14:18 I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;
461Co 14:19 however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind, that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
461Co 14:20 Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be babes, but in your thinking be mature.
461Co 14:21 In the Law it is written, "BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME," says the Lord.
461Co 14:22 So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy [is for a sign], not to unbelievers, but to those who believe.
461Co 14:23 If therefore the whole church should assemble together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?
461Co 14:24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;
461Co 14:25 the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.
461Co 14:26 What is [the outcome] then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.
461Co 14:27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, [it should be] by two or at the most three, and [each] in turn, and let one interpret;
461Co 14:28 but if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.
461Co 14:29 And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment.
461Co 14:30 But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, let the first keep silent.
461Co 14:31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted;
461Co 14:32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
461Co 14:33 for God is not [a God] of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
461Co 14:34 Let the women keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but let them subject themselves, just as the Law also says.
461Co 14:35 And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.
461Co 14:36 Was it from you that the word of God [first] went forth? Or has it come to you only?
461Co 14:37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment.
461Co 14:38 But if anyone does not recognize [this], he is not recognized.
461Co 14:39 Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.
461Co 14:40 But let all things be done properly and in an orderly manner.
461Co 15:1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
461Co 15:2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
461Co 15:3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
461Co 15:6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;
461Co 15:7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;
461Co 15:8 and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
461Co 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
461Co 15:11 Whether then [it was] I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
461Co 15:12 Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
461Co 15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised;
461Co 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.
461Co 15:15 Moreover we are even found [to be] false witnesses of God, because we witnessed against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;
461Co 15:17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.
461Co 15:18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
461Co 15:19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
461Co 15:20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.
461Co 15:21 For since by a man [came] death, by a man also [came] the resurrection of the dead.
461Co 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.
461Co 15:23 But each in his own order： Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ's at His coming,
461Co 15:24 then [comes] the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
461Co 15:25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
461Co 15:26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
461Co 15:27 For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, "All things are put in subjection," it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.
461Co 15:28 And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.
461Co 15:29 Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
461Co 15:30 Why are we also in danger every hour?
461Co 15:31 I protest, brethren, by the boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
461Co 15:32 If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, LET US EAT AND DRINK, FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.
461Co 15:33 Do not be deceived： "Bad company corrupts good morals."
461Co 15:34 Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak [this] to your shame.
461Co 15:35 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?"
461Co 15:36 You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies;
461Co 15:37 and that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.
461Co 15:38 But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.
461Co 15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.
461Co 15:40 There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the [glory] of the earthly is another.
461Co 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
461Co 15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable [ body], it is raised an imperishable [body];
461Co 15:43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
461Co 15:44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body.]
461Co 15:45 So also it is written, "The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL." The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.
461Co 15:46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.
461Co 15:47 The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.
461Co 15:48 As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.
461Co 15:49 And just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
461Co 15:50 Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
461Co 15:51 Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
461Co 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
461Co 15:53 For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.
461Co 15:54 But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, "DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
461Co 15:55 "O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?"
461Co 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;
461Co 15:57 but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not [in] vain in the Lord.
461Co 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.
461Co 16:2 On the first day of every week let each one of you put aside and save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
461Co 16:3 And when I arrive, whomever you may approve, I shall send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;
461Co 16:4 and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with me.
461Co 16:5 But I shall come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;
461Co 16:6 and perhaps I shall stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.
461Co 16:7 For I do not wish to see you now [just] in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
461Co 16:8 But I shall remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;
461Co 16:9 for a wide door for effective [service] has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
461Co 16:10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to be afraid; for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am.
461Co 16:11 Let no one therefore despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.
461Co 16:12 But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all [his] desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.
461Co 16:13 Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.
461Co 16:14 Let all that you do be done in love.
461Co 16:15 Now I urge you, brethren (you know the household of Stephanas, that they were the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to the saints),
461Co 16:16 that you also be in subjection to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
461Co 16:17 And I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.
461Co 16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
461Co 16:19 The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
461Co 16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
461Co 16:21 The greeting is in my own hand-- Paul.
461Co 16:22 If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Maranatha.
461Co 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
461Co 16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
47
472Co 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia：
472Co 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
472Co 1:3 Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
472Co 1:4 who comforts us in all our affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
472Co 1:5 For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.
472Co 1:6 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer;
472Co 1:7 and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are [sharers] of our comfort.
472Co 1:8 For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came [to us] in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;
472Co 1:9 indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;
472Co 1:10 who delivered us from so great a [peril of] death, and will deliver [us,] He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,
472Co 1:11 you also joining in helping us through your prayers, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed upon us through [the prayers of] many.
472Co 1:12 For our proud confidence is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.
472Co 1:13 For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand until the end;
472Co 1:14 just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason to be proud as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
472Co 1:15 And in this confidence I intended at first to come to you, that you might twice receive a blessing;
472Co 1:16 that is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey to Judea.
472Co 1:17 Therefore, I was not vacillating when I intended to do this, was I? Or that which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes, yes and no, no [at the same time]?
472Co 1:18 But as God is faithful, our word to you is not yes and no.
472Co 1:19 For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by us-- by me and Silvanus and Timothy-- was not yes and no, but is yes in Him.
472Co 1:20 For as many as may be the promises of God, in Him they are yes; wherefore also by Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us.
472Co 1:21 Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,
472Co 1:22 who also sealed us and gave [us] the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
472Co 1:23 But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.
472Co 1:24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but are workers with you for your joy; for in your faith you are standing firm.
472Co 2:1 But I determined this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.
472Co 2:2 For if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad but the one whom I made sorrowful?
472Co 2:3 And this is the very thing I wrote you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be [the joy] of you all.
472Co 2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.
472Co 2:5 But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but in some degree-- in order not to say too much-- to all of you.
472Co 2:6 Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted by] the majority,
472Co 2:7 so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort [him], lest somehow such a one be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
472Co 2:8 Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm [your] love for him.
472Co 2:9 For to this end also I wrote that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.
472Co 2:10 But whom you forgive anything, I [forgive] also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, [I did it] for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
472Co 2:11 in order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
472Co 2:12 Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,
472Co 2:13 I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in His triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.
472Co 2:15 For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;
472Co 2:16 to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?
472Co 2:17 For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
472Co 3:2 You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
472Co 3:3 being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
472Co 3:4 And such confidence we have through Christ toward God.
472Co 3:5 Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as [coming] from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,
472Co 3:6 who also made us adequate [as] servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
472Co 3:7 But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, fading [as] it was,
472Co 3:8 how shall the ministry of the Spirit fail to be even more with glory?
472Co 3:9 For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.
472Co 3:10 For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory on account of the glory that surpasses [it.]
472Co 3:11 For if that which fades away [was] with glory, much more that which remains [is] in glory.
472Co 3:12 Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness in [our] speech,
472Co 3:13 and [are] not as Moses, [who] used to put a veil over his face that the sons of Israel might not look intently at the end of what was fading away.
472Co 3:14 But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed in Christ.
472Co 3:15 But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart;
472Co 3:16 but whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
472Co 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, [there] is liberty.
472Co 3:18 But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.
472Co 4:1 Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not lose heart,
472Co 4:2 but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
472Co 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,
472Co 4:4 in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
472Co 4:5 For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus' sake.
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
472Co 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God and not from ourselves;
472Co 4:8 [we are] afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;
472Co 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
472Co 4:10 always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
472Co 4:11 For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
472Co 4:12 So death works in us, but life in you.
472Co 4:13 But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, " I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE, "we also believe, therefore also we speak;
472Co 4:14 knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you.
472Co 4:15 For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God.
472Co 4:16 Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
472Co 4:17 For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,
472Co 4:18 while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
472Co 5:1 For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
472Co 5:2 For indeed in this [house] we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven;
472Co 5:3 inasmuch as we, having put it on, shall not be found naked.
472Co 5:4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
472Co 5:5 Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.
472Co 5:6 Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord--
472Co 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight--
472Co 5:8 we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
472Co 5:9 Therefore also we have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.
472Co 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
472Co 5:11 Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
472Co 5:12 We are not again commending ourselves to you but [are] giving you an occasion to be proud of us, that you may have [an answer] for those who take pride in appearance, and not in heart.
472Co 5:13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.
472Co 5:14 For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;
472Co 5:15 and He died for all, that they who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.
472Co 5:16 Therefore from now on we recognize no man according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him] [thus] no longer.
472Co 5:17 Therefore if any man is in Christ, [he is] a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.
472Co 5:18 Now all [these] things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
472Co 5:19 namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
472Co 5:20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were entreating through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
472Co 5:21 He made Him who knew no sin [to be] sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
472Co 6:1 And working together [with Him,] we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain--
472Co 6:2 for He says, "AT THE ACCEPTABLE TIME I LISTENED TO YOU, AND ON THE DAY OF SALVATION I HELPED YOU"; behold, now is "THE ACCEPTABLE TIME," behold, now is" THE DAY OF SALVATION "--
472Co 6:3 giving no cause for offense in anything, in order that the ministry be not discredited,
472Co 6:4 but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
472Co 6:5 in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger,
472Co 6:6 in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,
472Co 6:7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,
472Co 6:8 by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; [regarded] as deceivers and yet true;
472Co 6:9 as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death,
472Co 6:10 as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.
472Co 6:11 Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide.
472Co 6:12 You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections.
472Co 6:13 Now in a like exchange-- I speak as to children-- open wide [to us] also.
472Co 6:14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?
472Co 6:15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
472Co 6:16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, "I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.
472Co 6:17 "Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE," says the Lord. "AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you.
472Co 6:18 "And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me," Says the Lord Almighty.
472Co 7:1 Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
472Co 7:2 Make room for us [in your hearts;] we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.
472Co 7:3 I do not speak to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.
472Co 7:4 Great is my confidence in you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort. I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.
472Co 7:5 For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side： conflicts without, fears within.
472Co 7:6 But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
472Co 7:7 and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.
472Co 7:8 For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it-- [for] I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while--
472Co 7:9 I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to [the point of] repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to [the will of] God, in order that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.
472Co 7:10 For the sorrow that is according to [the will of] God produces a repentance without regret, [leading] to salvation; but the sorrow of the world produces death.
472Co 7:11 For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you： what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.
472Co 7:12 So although I wrote to you [it was] not for the sake of the offender, nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God.
472Co 7:13 For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
472Co 7:14 For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be [the] truth.
472Co 7:15 And his affection abounds all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
472Co 7:16 I rejoice that in everything I have confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 Now, brethren, we [wish to] make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
472Co 8:2 that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
472Co 8:3 For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability [they gave] of their own accord,
472Co 8:4 begging us with much entreaty for the favor of participation in the support of the saints,
472Co 8:5 and [this,] not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.
472Co 8:6 Consequently we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.
472Co 8:7 But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, [see] that you abound in this gracious work also.
472Co 8:8 I am not speaking [this] as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.
472Co 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.
472Co 8:10 And I give [my] opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do [this,] but also to desire [to do it.]
472Co 8:11 But now finish doing it also; that just as [there was] the readiness to desire it, so [there may be] also the completion of it by your ability.
472Co 8:12 For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what [a man] has, not according to what he does not have.
472Co 8:13 For [this] is not for the ease of others [and] for your affliction, but by way of equality--
472Co 8:14 at this present time your abundance [being a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may become [a supply] for your want, that there may be equality;
472Co 8:15 as it is written, "HE WHO [gathered] MUCH DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH, AND HE WHO [gathered] LITTLE HAD NO LACK."
472Co 8:16 But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus.
472Co 8:17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.
472Co 8:18 And we have sent along with him the brother whose fame in [the things of] the gospel [has spread] through all the churches;
472Co 8:19 and not only [this,] but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and [to show] our readiness,
472Co 8:20 taking precaution that no one should discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;
472Co 8:21 for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
472Co 8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent, because of [his] great confidence in you.
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, [they are] messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.
472Co 8:24 Therefore openly before the churches show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.
472Co 9:1 For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints;
472Co 9:2 for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, [namely,] that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has stirred up most of them.
472Co 9:3 But I have sent the brethren, that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, that, as I was saying, you may be prepared;
472Co 9:4 lest if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to speak of you) should be put to shame by this confidence.
472Co 9:5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised bountiful gift, that the same might be ready as a bountiful gift, and not affected by covetousness.
472Co 9:6 Now this [I say,] he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
472Co 9:7 Let each one [do] just as he has purposed in his heart; not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
472Co 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;
472Co 9:9 as it is written, "HE SCATTERED ABROAD, HE GAVE TO THE POOR, HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS ABIDES FOREVER."
472Co 9:10 Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;
472Co 9:11 you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which through us is producing thanksgiving to God.
472Co 9:12 For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.
472Co 9:13 Because of the proof given by this ministry they will glorify God for [your] obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,
472Co 9:14 while they also, by prayer on your behalf, yearn for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
472Co 9:15 Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
472Co 10:1 Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ-- I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when absent!
472Co 10:2 I ask that when I am present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
472Co 10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh,
472Co 10:4 for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
472Co 10:5 [We are] destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and [we are] taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,
472Co 10:6 and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.
472Co 10:7 You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
472Co 10:8 For even if I should boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame,
472Co 10:9 for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
472Co 10:10 For they say, "His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is unimpressive, and his speech contemptible."
472Co 10:11 Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons [we are] also in deed when present.
472Co 10:12 For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.
472Co 10:13 But we will not boast beyond [our] measure, but within the measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.
472Co 10:14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of Christ;
472Co 10:15 not boasting beyond [our] measure, [that is,] in other men's labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we shall be, within our sphere, enlarged even more by you,
472Co 10:16 so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, [and] not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another.
472Co 10:17 But HE WHO BOASTS, LET HIM BOAST IN THE LORD.
472Co 10:18 For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
472Co 11:1 I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me.
472Co 11:2 For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, that to Christ I might present you [as] a pure virgin.
472Co 11:3 But I am afraid, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity [ of devotion] to Christ.
472Co 11:4 For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear [this] beautifully.
472Co 11:5 For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles.
472Co 11:6 But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not [so] in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made [this] evident to you in all things.
472Co 11:7 Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?
472Co 11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages [from them] to serve you;
472Co 11:9 and when I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia, they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so.
472Co 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.
472Co 11:11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows [I do!]
472Co 11:12 But what I am doing, I will continue to do, that I may cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting.
472Co 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
472Co 11:14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
472Co 11:15 Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their deeds.
472Co 11:16 Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if [you do,] receive me even as foolish, that I also may boast a little.
472Co 11:17 That which I am speaking, I am not speaking as the Lord would, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
472Co 11:18 Since many boast according to the flesh, I will boast also.
472Co 11:19 For you, being [so] wise, bear with the foolish gladly.
472Co 11:20 For you bear with anyone if he enslaves you, if he devours you, if he takes advantage of you, if he exalts himself, if he hits you in the face.
472Co 11:21 To [my] shame I [must] say that we have been weak [by comparison.] But in whatever respect anyone [else] is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am just as bold myself.
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
472Co 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as if insane) I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.
472Co 11:24 Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine [lashes.]
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.
472Co 11:26 [I have been] on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from [my] countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren;
472Co 11:27 [I have been] in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.
472Co 11:28 Apart from [such] external things, there is the daily pressure upon me [of] concern for all the churches.
472Co 11:29 Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
472Co 11:30 If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness.
472Co 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
472Co 11:32 In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me,
472Co 11:33 and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and [ so] escaped his hands.
472Co 12:1 Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
472Co 12:2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago-- whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows-- such a man was caught up to the third heaven.
472Co 12:3 And I know how such a man-- whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows--
472Co 12:4 was caught up into Paradise, and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.
472Co 12:5 On behalf of such a man will I boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to [my] weaknesses.
472Co 12:6 For if I do wish to boast I shall not be foolish, for I shall be speaking the truth; but I refrain [from this,] so that no one may credit me with more than he sees [in] me or hears from me.
472Co 12:7 And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me-- to keep me from exalting myself!
472Co 12:8 Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
472Co 12:9 And He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
472Co 12:10 Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
472Co 12:11 I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody.
472Co 12:12 The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.
472Co 12:13 For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for [their] parents, but parents for [their] children.
472Co 12:15 And I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less?
472Co 12:16 But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit.
472Co 12:17 [Certainly] I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I?
472Co 12:18 I urged Titus [to go,] and sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit [and walk] in the same steps?
472Co 12:19 All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. [Actually,] it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved.
472Co 12:20 For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps [there may be] strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;
472Co 12:21 I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.
472Co 13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES.
472Co 13:2 I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again, I will not spare [anyone,]
472Co 13:3 since you are seeking for proof of the Christ who speaks in me, and who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.
472Co 13:4 For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him because of the power of God [directed] toward you.
472Co 13:5 Test yourselves [to see] if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you-- unless indeed you fail the test?
472Co 13:6 But I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test.
472Co 13:7 Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though we should appear unapproved.
472Co 13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but [only] for the truth.
472Co 13:9 For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you be made complete.
472Co 13:10 For this reason I am writing these things while absent, in order that when present I may not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me, for building up and not for tearing down.
472Co 13:11 Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
472Co 13:13 All the saints greet you.
472Co 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
48
48Gl 1:1 Paul, an apostle (not [sent] from men, nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
48Gl 1:2 and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia：
48Gl 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48Gl 1:4 who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48Gl 1:5 to whom [be] the glory forevermore. Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;
48Gl 1:7 which is [really] not another; only there are some who are disturbing you, and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
48Gl 1:8 But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.
48Gl 1:9 As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed.
48Gl 1:10 For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.
48Gl 1:11 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
48Gl 1:12 For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but [I received it] through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
48Gl 1:13 For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure, and tried to destroy it;
48Gl 1:14 and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.
48Gl 1:15 But when He who had set me apart, [even] from my mother's womb, and called me through His grace, was pleased
48Gl 1:16 to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
48Gl 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.
48Gl 1:19 But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord's brother.
48Gl 1:20 (Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)
48Gl 1:21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
48Gl 1:22 And I was [still] unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;
48Gl 1:23 but only, they kept hearing, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy."
48Gl 1:24 And they were glorifying God because of me.
48Gl 2:1 Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.
48Gl 2:2 And it was because of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but [I did so] in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.
48Gl 2:3 But not even Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
48Gl 2:4 But [it was] because of the false brethren who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage.
48Gl 2:5 But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
48Gl 2:6 But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)-- well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me.
48Gl 2:7 But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter [had been] to the circumcised
48Gl 2:8 (for He who effectually worked for Peter in [his] apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),
48Gl 2:9 and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we [might go] to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
48Gl 2:10 [They] only [asked] us to remember the poor-- the very thing I also was eager to do.
48Gl 2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
48Gl 2:12 For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he [began] to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision.
48Gl 2:13 And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
48Gl 2:14 But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, "If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how [is it that] you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?
48Gl 2:15 "We [are] Jews by nature, and not sinners from among the Gentiles;
48Gl 2:16 nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.
48Gl 2:17 "But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!
48Gl 2:18 "For if I rebuild what I have [once] destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
48Gl 2:19 "For through the Law I died to the Law, that I might live to God.
48Gl 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.
48Gl 2:21 "I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness [comes] through the Law, then Christ died needlessly."
48Gl 3:1 You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed [as] crucified?
48Gl 3:2 This is the only thing I want to find out from you： did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
48Gl 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
48Gl 3:4 Did you suffer so many things in vain-- if indeed it was in vain?
48Gl 3:5 Does He then, who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
48Gl 3:6 Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
48Gl 3:7 Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.
48Gl 3:8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, [saying], "ALL THE NATIONS SHALL BE BLESSED IN YOU."
48Gl 3:9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.
48Gl 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM."
48Gl 3:11 Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, " THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. "
48Gl 3:12 However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, "HE WHO PRACTICES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM."
48Gl 3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us-- for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"- -
48Gl 3:14 in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
48Gl 3:15 Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations： even though it is [ only] a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.
48Gl 3:16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, "And to seeds," as [referring] to many, but [rather] to one, "And to your seed," that is, Christ.
48Gl 3:17 What I am saying is this： the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
48Gl 3:19 Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed should come to whom the promise had been made.
48Gl 3:20 Now a mediator is not for one [party only]; whereas God is [only] one.
48Gl 3:21 Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.
48Gl 3:22 But the Scripture has shut up all men under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
48Gl 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
48Gl 3:24 Therefore the Law has become our tutor [to lead us] to Christ, that we may be justified by faith.
48Gl 3:25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
48Gl 3:26 For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:27 For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48Gl 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:29 And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.
48Gl 4:1 Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything,
48Gl 4:2 but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.
48Gl 4:3 So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.
48Gl 4:4 But when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,
48Gl 4:5 in order that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
48Gl 4:6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
48Gl 4:7 Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
48Gl 4:8 However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.
48Gl 4:9 But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?
48Gl 4:10 You observe days and months and seasons and years.
48Gl 4:11 I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.
48Gl 4:12 I beg of you, brethren, become as I [am], for I also [have become] as you [are.] You have done me no wrong;
48Gl 4:13 but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I preached the gospel to you the first time;
48Gl 4:14 and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus [Himself.]
48Gl 4:15 Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you witness, that if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
48Gl 4:16 Have I therefore become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48Gl 4:17 They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out, in order that you may seek them.
48Gl 4:18 But it is good always to be eagerly sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you.
48Gl 4:19 My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you--
48Gl 4:20 but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?
48Gl 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman.
48Gl 4:23 But the son by the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.
48Gl 4:24 This is allegorically speaking： for these [women] are two covenants, one [proceeding] from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.
48Gl 4:25 Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48Gl 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.
48Gl 4:27 For it is written, "REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT BEAR; BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR; FOR MORE ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND."
48Gl 4:28 And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48Gl 4:29 But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him [who was born] according to the Spirit, so it is now also.
48Gl 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? "CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON, FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN."
48Gl 4:31 So then, brethren, we are not children of a bondwoman, but of the free woman.
48Gl 5:1 It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.
48Gl 5:2 Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
48Gl 5:3 And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.
48Gl 5:4 You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
48Gl 5:5 For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.
48Gl 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
48Gl 5:8 This persuasion [did] not [come] from Him who calls you.
48Gl 5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump [of dough.]
48Gl 5:10 I have confidence in you in the Lord, that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.
48Gl 5:11 But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.
48Gl 5:12 Would that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.
48Gl 5:13 For you were called to freedom, brethren; only [do] not [turn] your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
48Gl 5:14 For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the [statement], " YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF. "
48Gl 5:15 But if you bite and devour one another, take care lest you be consumed by one another.
48Gl 5:16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
48Gl 5:17 For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.
48Gl 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.
48Gl 5:19 Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are： immorality, impurity, sensuality,
48Gl 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,
48Gl 5:21 envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48Gl 5:23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
48Gl 5:24 Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
48Gl 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
48Gl 5:26 Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.
48Gl 6:1 Brethren, even if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; [each one] looking to yourself, lest you too be tempted.
48Gl 6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
48Gl 6:3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
48Gl 6:4 But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have [reason for] boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.
48Gl 6:5 For each one shall bear his own load.
48Gl 6:6 And let the one who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches.
48Gl 6:7 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
48Gl 6:8 For the one who sows to his own flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap eternal life.
48Gl 6:9 And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary.
48Gl 6:10 So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
48Gl 6:11 See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
48Gl 6:12 Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48Gl 6:13 For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
48Gl 6:14 But may it never be that I should boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48Gl 6:15 For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
48Gl 6:16 And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy [be] upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
48Gl 6:17 From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the brand-marks of Jesus.
48Gl 6:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

49Eph 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and [who are] faithful in Christ Jesus：
49Eph 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 1:3 Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly [places] in Christ,
49Eph 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love
49Eph 1:5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
49Eph 1:6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
49Eph 1:7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace,
49Eph 1:8 which He lavished upon us. In all wisdom and insight
49Eph 1:9 He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him
49Eph 1:10 with a view to an administration suitable to the fulness of the times, [that is], the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things upon the earth. In Him
49Eph 1:11 also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,
49Eph 1:12 to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
49Eph 1:13 In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation-- having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,
49Eph 1:14 who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of [God's own] possession, to the praise of His glory.
49Eph 1:15 For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which [exists] among you, and your love for all the saints,
49Eph 1:16 do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention [of you] in my prayers;
49Eph 1:17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.
49Eph 1:18 [I pray that] the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
49Eph 1:19 and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. [These are] in accordance with the working of the strength of His might
49Eph 1:20 which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly [places],
49Eph 1:21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
49Eph 1:22 And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
49Eph 1:23 which is His body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.
49Eph 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
49Eph 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
49Eph 2:3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
49Eph 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
49Eph 2:5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
49Eph 2:6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly [places], in Christ Jesus,
49Eph 2:7 in order that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, [it is] the gift of God;
49Eph 2:9 not as a result of works, that no one should boast.
49Eph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
49Eph 2:11 Therefore remember, that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision," [which is] performed in the flesh by human hands--
49Eph 2:12 [remember] that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
49Eph 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
49Eph 2:14 For He Himself is our peace, who made both [groups into] one, and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,
49Eph 2:15 by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, [which is] the Law of commandments [contained] in ordinances, that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, [thus] establishing peace,
49Eph 2:16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.
49Eph 2:17 AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;
49Eph 2:18 for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
49Eph 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,
49Eph 2:20 having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner [stone],
49Eph 2:21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord;
49Eph 2:22 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
49Eph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
49Eph 3:2 if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you;
49Eph 3:3 that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.
49Eph 3:4 And by referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
49Eph 3:5 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
49Eph 3:6 [to be specific], that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
49Eph 3:7 of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.
49Eph 3:8 To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
49Eph 3:9 and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things;
49Eph 3:10 in order that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly [places.]
49Eph 3:11 [This was] in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
49Eph 3:12 in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
49Eph 3:13 Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.
49Eph 3:14 For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,
49Eph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
49Eph 3:16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man;
49Eph 3:17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; [and] that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
49Eph 3:18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
49Eph 3:19 and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fulness of God.
49Eph 3:20 Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,
49Eph 3:21 to Him [be] the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
49Eph 4:1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, entreat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,
49Eph 4:2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love,
49Eph 4:3 being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
49Eph 4:4 [There is] one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
49Eph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
49Eph 4:7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
49Eph 4:8 Therefore it says, "WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN."
49Eph 4:9 (Now this [expression,] "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?
49Eph 4:10 He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)
49Eph 4:11 And He gave some [as] apostles, and some [as] prophets, and some [as] evangelists, and some [as] pastors and teachers,
49Eph 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;
49Eph 4:13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fulness of Christ.
49Eph 4:14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;
49Eph 4:15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all [aspects] into Him, who is the head, [even] Christ,
49Eph 4:16 from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
49Eph 4:17 This I say therefore, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
49Eph 4:18 being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
49Eph 4:19 and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality, for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
49Eph 4:20 But you did not learn Christ in this way,
49Eph 4:21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,
49Eph 4:22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,
49Eph 4:23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
49Eph 4:24 and put on the new self, which in [the likeness of] God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
49Eph 4:25 Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH, EACH ONE [of you,] WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.
49Eph 4:26 BE ANGRY, AND [yet] DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
49Eph 4:27 and do not give the devil an opportunity.
49Eph 4:28 Let him who steals steal no longer; but rather let him labor, performing with his own hands what is good, in order that he may have [something] to share with him who has need.
49Eph 4:29 Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such [a word] as is good for edification according to the need [of the moment,] that it may give grace to those who hear.
49Eph 4:30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49Eph 4:31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
49Eph 4:32 And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
49Eph 5:1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;
49Eph 5:2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
49Eph 5:3 But do not let immorality or any impurity or greed even be named among you, as is proper among saints;
49Eph 5:4 and [there must be no] filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
49Eph 5:5 For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
49Eph 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
49Eph 5:7 Therefore do not be partakers with them;
49Eph 5:8 for you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light
49Eph 5:9 (for the fruit of the light [consists] in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
49Eph 5:10 trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
49Eph 5:11 And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;
49Eph 5:12 for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
49Eph 5:13 But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.
49Eph 5:14 For this reason it says, "Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you."
49Eph 5:15 Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,
49Eph 5:16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
49Eph 5:17 So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
49Eph 5:18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
49Eph 5:19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
49Eph 5:20 always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
49Eph 5:21 and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
49Eph 5:22 Wives, [be subject] to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
49Eph 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself [being] the Savior of the body.
49Eph 5:24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives [ought to be] to their husbands in everything.
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her;
49Eph 5:26 that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
49Eph 5:27 that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she should be holy and blameless.
49Eph 5:28 So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;
49Eph 5:29 for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also [does] the church,
49Eph 5:30 because we are members of His body.
49Eph 5:31 FOR THIS CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE; AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.
49Eph 5:32 This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
49Eph 5:33 Nevertheless let each individual among you also love his own wife even as himself; and [let] the wife [see to it] that she respect her husband.
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
49Eph 6:2 HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
49Eph 6:3 THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
49Eph 6:4 And, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;
49Eph 6:6 not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
49Eph 6:7 With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,
49Eph 6:8 knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.
49Eph 6:9 And, masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.
49Eph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might.
49Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
49Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual [forces] of wickedness in the heavenly [places.]
49Eph 6:13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
49Eph 6:14 Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,
49Eph 6:15 and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;
49Eph 6:16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil [one.]
49Eph 6:17 And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49Eph 6:18 With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,
49Eph 6:19 and [pray] on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
49Eph 6:20 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in [proclaiming] it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
49Eph 6:21 But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.
49Eph 6:22 And I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
49Eph 6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 6:24 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with [a love] incorruptible.
50
50Php 1:1 Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons：
50Php 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
50Php 1:4 always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,
50Php 1:5 in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.
50Php 1:6 [For I am] confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:7 For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.
50Php 1:8 For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
50Php 1:10 so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;
50Php 1:11 having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which [comes] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
50Php 1:12 Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,
50Php 1:13 so that my imprisonment in [the cause of] Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,
50Php 1:14 and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.
50Php 1:15 Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from good will;
50Php 1:16 the latter [do it] out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel;
50Php 1:17 the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.
50Php 1:18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.
50Php 1:19 For I know that this shall turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
50Php 1:20 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall not be put to shame in anything, but [that] with all boldness, Christ shall even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
50Php 1:21 For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
50Php 1:22 But if [I am] to live [on] in the flesh, this [will mean] fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose.
50Php 1:23 But I am hard-pressed from both [directions,] having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for [that] is very much better;
50Php 1:24 yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
50Php 1:25 And convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,
50Php 1:26 so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
50Php 1:27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ; so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
50Php 1:28 in no way alarmed by [your] opponents-- which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that [too], from God.
50Php 1:29 For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
50Php 1:30 experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.
50Php 2:1 If therefore there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,
50Php 2:2 make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
50Php 2:3 Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself;
50Php 2:4 do not [merely] look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
50Php 2:5 Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,
50Php 2:6 who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
50Php 2:7 but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, [and] being made in the likeness of men.
50Php 2:8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
50Php 2:9 Therefore also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,
50Php 2:10 that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE SHOULD BOW, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth,
50Php 2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50Php 2:12 So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;
50Php 2:13 for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for [ His] good pleasure.
50Php 2:14 Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
50Php 2:15 that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
50Php 2:16 holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may have cause to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.
50Php 2:17 But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
50Php 2:18 And you too, [I urge you,] rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
50Php 2:19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
50Php 2:20 For I have no one [else] of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.
50Php 2:21 For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
50Php 2:22 But you know of his proven worth that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child [serving] his father.
50Php 2:23 Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things [go] with me;
50Php 2:24 and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall be coming shortly.
50Php 2:25 But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;
50Php 2:26 because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
50Php 2:27 For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
50Php 2:28 Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly in order that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned [about you.]
50Php 2:29 Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high regard;
50Php 2:30 because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.
50Php 3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things [ again] is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
50Php 3:2 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision;
50Php 3:3 for we are the [true] circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,
50Php 3:4 although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more：
50Php 3:5 circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;
50Php 3:6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found blameless.
50Php 3:7 But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
50Php 3:8 More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ,
50Php 3:9 and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from [the] Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which [comes] from God on the basis of faith,
50Php 3:10 that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;
50Php 3:11 in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
50Php 3:12 Not that I have already obtained [it], or have already become perfect, but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:13 Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of [it] yet; but one thing [I do]： forgetting what [lies] behind and reaching forward to what [lies] ahead,
50Php 3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:15 Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you;
50Php 3:16 however, let us keep living by that same [standard] to which we have attained.
50Php 3:17 Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
50Php 3:18 For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] enemies of the cross of Christ,
50Php 3:19 whose end is destruction, whose god is [their] appetite, and [whose] glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.
50Php 3:20 For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;
50Php 3:21 who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.
50Php 4:1 Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long [to see], my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
50Php 4:2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
50Php 4:3 Indeed, true comrade, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle in [the cause of] the gospel, together with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
50Php 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!
50Php 4:5 Let your forbearing [spirit] be known to all men. The Lord is near.
50Php 4:6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
50Php 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.
50Php 4:9 The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things; and the God of peace shall be with you.
50Php 4:10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned [before,] but you lacked opportunity.
50Php 4:11 Not that I speak from want; for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
50Php 4:12 I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.
50Php 4:13 I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.
50Php 4:14 Nevertheless, you have done well to share [with me] in my affliction.
50Php 4:15 And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone;
50Php 4:16 for even in Thessalonica you sent [a gift] more than once for my needs.
50Php 4:17 Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.
50Php 4:18 But I have received everything in full, and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:20 Now to our God and Father [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.
50Php 4:21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
50Php 4:22 All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
50Php 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
51
51Col 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51Col 1:2 to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ [who are] at Colossae： Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
51Col 1:3 We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
51Col 1:4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;
51Col 1:5 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel,
51Col 1:6 which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as [it has been doing] in you also since the day you heard [of it] and understood the grace of God in truth;
51Col 1:7 just as you learned [it] from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,
51Col 1:8 and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.
51Col 1:9 For this reason also, since the day we heard [of it], we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
51Col 1:10 so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please [Him] in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
51Col 1:11 strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously
51Col 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
51Col 1:13 For He delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,
51Col 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51Col 1:15 And He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation.
51Col 1:16 For by Him all things were created, [both] in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities-- all things have been created by Him and for Him.
51Col 1:17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
51Col 1:18 He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; so that He Himself might come to have first place in everything.
51Col 1:19 For it was the [Father's] good pleasure for all the fulness to dwell in Him,
51Col 1:20 and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, [I say], whether things on earth or things in heaven.
51Col 1:21 And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, [engaged] in evil deeds,
51Col 1:22 yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach--
51Col 1:23 if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.
51Col 1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body (which is the church) in filling up that which is lacking in Christ's afflictions.
51Col 1:25 Of [this church] I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, that I might fully carry out the [preaching of] the word of God,
51Col 1:26 [that is,] the mystery which has been hidden from the [past] ages and generations; but has now been manifested to His saints,
51Col 1:27 to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51Col 1:28 And we proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, that we may present every man complete in Christ.
51Col 1:29 And for this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.
51Col 2:1 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,
51Col 2:2 that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and [attaining] to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, [resulting] in a true knowledge of God's mystery, [that is,] Christ [Himself],
51Col 2:3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51Col 2:4 I say this in order that no one may delude you with persuasive argument.
51Col 2:5 For even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline and the stability of your faith in Christ.
51Col 2:6 As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk in Him,
51Col 2:7 having been firmly rooted [and now] being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, [and] overflowing with gratitude.
51Col 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
51Col 2:9 For in Him all the fulness of Deity dwells in bodily form,
51Col 2:10 and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and authority;
51Col 2:11 and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;
51Col 2:12 having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
51Col 2:13 And when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions,
51Col 2:14 having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us [and] which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
51Col 2:15 When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.
51Col 2:16 Therefore let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day--
51Col 2:17 things which are a [mere] shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
51Col 2:18 Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on [visions] he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,
51Col 2:19 and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.
51Col 2:20 If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,
51Col 2:21 "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!"
51Col 2:22 (which all [refer to] things destined to perish with the using)-- in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?
51Col 2:23 These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, [ but are] of no value against fleshly indulgence.
51Col 3:1 If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
51Col 3:2 Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.
51Col 3:3 For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
51Col 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
51Col 3:5 Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.
51Col 3:6 For it is on account of these things that the wrath of God will come,
51Col 3:7 and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.
51Col 3:8 But now you also, put them all aside： anger, wrath, malice, slander, [ and] abusive speech from your mouth.
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its [evil] practices,
51Col 3:10 and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him
51Col 3:11 --[a renewal] in which there is no [distinction between] Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all.
51Col 3:12 And so, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;
51Col 3:13 bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.
51Col 3:14 And beyond all these things [put on] love, which is the perfect bond of unity.
51Col 3:15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms [and] hymns [and] spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.
51Col 3:18 Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be embittered against them.
51Col 3:20 Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not exasperate your children, that they may not lose heart.
51Col 3:22 Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who [merely] please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men;
51Col 3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.
51Col 3:25 For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.
51Col 4:1 Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven.
51Col 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with [an attitude of] thanksgiving;
51Col 4:3 praying at the same time for us as well, that God may open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;
51Col 4:4 in order that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
51Col 4:5 Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.
51Col 4:6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, [as it were,] with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person.
51Col 4:7 As to all my affairs, Tychicus, [our] beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information.
51Col 4:8 For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know [ about] our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;
51Col 4:9 and with him Onesimus, [our] faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your [number.] They will inform you about the whole situation here.
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and [also] Barnabas' cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions： if he comes to you, welcome him);
51Col 4:11 and [also] Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision; and they have proved to be an encouragement to me.
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
51Col 4:13 For I bear him witness that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51Col 4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and [also] Demas.
51Col 4:15 Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house.
51Col 4:16 And when this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter [that is coming] from Laodicea.
51Col 4:17 And say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it."
51Col 4:18 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
52
521Th 1:1 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ： Grace to you and peace.
521Th 1:2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention [of you] in our prayers;
521Th 1:3 constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,
521Th 1:4 knowing, brethren beloved by God, [His] choice of you;
521Th 1:5 for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
521Th 1:6 You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
521Th 1:7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
521Th 1:8 For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth, so that we have no need to say anything.
521Th 1:9 For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,
521Th 1:10 and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, [ that is] Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
521Th 2:1 For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain,
521Th 2:2 but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.
521Th 2:3 For our exhortation does not [come] from error or impurity or by way of deceit;
521Th 2:4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who examines our hearts.
521Th 2:5 For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed-- God is witness--
521Th 2:6 nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority.
521Th 2:7 But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing [mother] tenderly cares for her own children.
521Th 2:8 Having thus a fond affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
521Th 2:9 For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, [how] working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
521Th 2:10 You are witnesses, and [so is] God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers;
521Th 2:11 just as you know how we [were] exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father [would] his own children,
521Th 2:12 so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
521Th 2:13 And for this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received from us the word of God's message, you accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but [for] what it really is, the word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.
521Th 2:14 For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they [did] from the Jews,
521Th 2:15 who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men,
521Th 2:16 hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
521Th 2:17 But we, brethren, having been bereft of you for a short while-- in person, not in spirit-- were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.
521Th 2:18 For we wanted to come to you-- I, Paul, more than once-- and [yet] Satan thwarted us.
521Th 2:19 For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?
521Th 2:20 For you are our glory and joy.
521Th 3:1 Therefore when we could endure [it] no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone;
521Th 3:2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,
521Th 3:3 so that no man may be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.
521Th 3:4 For indeed when we were with you, we [kept] telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know.
521Th 3:5 For this reason, when I could endure [it] no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
521Th 3:6 But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also long to see you,
521Th 3:7 for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;
521Th 3:8 for now we [really] live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account,
521Th 3:10 as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?
521Th 3:11 Now may our God and Father Himself and Jesus our Lord direct our way to you;
521Th 3:12 and may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another, and for all men, just as we also [do] for you;
521Th 3:13 so that He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.
521Th 4:1 Finally then, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as you received from us [instruction] as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you may excel still more.
521Th 4:2 For you know what commandments we gave you by [the authority of] the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification; [that is,] that you abstain from sexual immorality;
521Th 4:4 that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
521Th 4:5 not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;
521Th 4:6 [and] that no man transgress and defraud his brother in the matter because the Lord is [the] avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned [you.]
521Th 4:7 For God has not called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.
521Th 4:8 Consequently, he who rejects [this] is not rejecting man but the God who gives His Holy Spirit to you.
521Th 4:9 Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for [anyone] to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;
521Th 4:10 for indeed you do practice it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still more,
521Th 4:11 and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own business and work with your hands, just as we commanded you;
521Th 4:12 so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.
521Th 4:13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve, as do the rest who have no hope.
521Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
521Th 4:15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, and remain until the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep.
521Th 4:16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of [the] archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
521Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord.
521Th 4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.
521Th 5:1 Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you.
521Th 5:2 For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 While they are saying, "Peace and safety!" then destruction will come upon them suddenly like birth pangs upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
521Th 5:4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief;
521Th 5:5 for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;
521Th 5:6 so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober.
521Th 5:7 For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night.
521Th 5:8 But since we are of [the] day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.
521Th 5:9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
521Th 5:10 who died for us, that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.
521Th 5:11 Therefore encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you also are doing.
521Th 5:12 But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you instruction,
521Th 5:13 and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
521Th 5:14 And we urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men.
521Th 5:15 See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all men.
521Th 5:16 Rejoice always;
521Th 5:17 pray without ceasing;
521Th 5:18 in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
521Th 5:19 Do not quench the Spirit;
521Th 5:20 do not despise prophetic utterances.
521Th 5:21 But examine everything [carefully]; hold fast to that which is good;
521Th 5:22 abstain from every form of evil.
521Th 5:23 Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 5:24 Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.
521Th 5:25 Brethren, pray for us.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
521Th 5:27 I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.
521Th 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53
532Th 1:1 Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ：
532Th 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 1:3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is [only] fitting, because your faith is greatly enlarged, and the love of each one of you toward one another grows [ever] greater;
532Th 1:4 therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure.
532Th 1:5 [This is] a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.
532Th 1:6 For after all it is [only] just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
532Th 1:7 and [to give] relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire,
532Th 1:8 dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
532Th 1:10 when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was believed.
532Th 1:11 To this end also we pray for you always that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power;
532Th 1:12 in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:1 Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to Him,
532Th 2:2 that you may not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
532Th 2:3 Let no one in any way deceive you, for [it will not come] unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
532Th 2:4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.
532Th 2:5 Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?
532Th 2:6 And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he may be revealed.
532Th 2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains [will do so] until he is taken out of the way.
532Th 2:8 And then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;
532Th 2:9 [that is,] the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,
532Th 2:10 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.
532Th 2:11 And for this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they might believe what is false,
532Th 2:12 in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.
532Th 2:13 But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
532Th 2:14 And it was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:15 So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word [of mouth] or by letter from us.
532Th 2:16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,
532Th 2:17 comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.
532Th 3:1 Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, just as [it did] also with you;
532Th 3:2 and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil men; for not all have faith.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil [one.]
532Th 3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will [continue to] do what we command.
532Th 3:5 And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ.
532Th 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep aloof from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us.
532Th 3:7 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you,
532Th 3:8 nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we [kept] working night and day so that we might not be a burden to any of you;
532Th 3:9 not because we do not have the right [to this,] but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, that you might follow our example.
532Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order： if anyone will not work, neither let him eat.
532Th 3:11 For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.
532Th 3:12 Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.
532Th 3:13 But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.
532Th 3:14 And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that man and do not associate with him, so that he may be put to shame.
532Th 3:15 And [yet] do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
532Th 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!
532Th 3:17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.
532Th 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
54
541Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, [who is] our hope;
541Tm 1:2 to Timothy, [my] true child in [the] faith： Grace, mercy [and] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
541Tm 1:3 As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus, in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,
541Tm 1:4 nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than [furthering] the administration of God which is by faith.
541Tm 1:5 But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
541Tm 1:6 For some men, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion,
541Tm 1:7 wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
541Tm 1:8 But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
541Tm 1:9 realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers
541Tm 1:10 and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,
541Tm 1:11 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
541Tm 1:12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service;
541Tm 1:13 even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. And yet I was shown mercy, because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;
541Tm 1:14 and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are [found] in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost [ of all.]
541Tm 1:16 And yet for this reason I found mercy, in order that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
541Tm 1:18 This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight the good fight,
541Tm 1:19 keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
541Tm 1:20 Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered over to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
541Tm 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that entreaties [and] prayers, petitions [ and] thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,
541Tm 2:2 for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
541Tm 2:3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
541Tm 2:5 For there is one God, [and] one mediator also between God and men, [ the] man Christ Jesus,
541Tm 2:6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony [borne] at the proper time.
541Tm 2:7 And for this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
541Tm 2:8 Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.
541Tm 2:9 Likewise, [I want] women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments;
541Tm 2:10 but rather by means of good works, as befits women making a claim to godliness.
541Tm 2:11 Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
541Tm 2:12 But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
541Tm 2:13 For it was Adam who was first created, [and] then Eve.
541Tm 2:14 And [it was] not Adam [who] was deceived, but the woman being quite deceived, fell into transgression.
541Tm 2:15 But [women] shall be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
541Tm 3:1 It is a trustworthy statement： if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires [to do.]
541Tm 3:2 An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
541Tm 3:3 not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, uncontentious, free from the love of money.
541Tm 3:4 [He must be] one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity
541Tm 3:5 (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?);
541Tm 3:6 [and] not a new convert, lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
541Tm 3:7 And he must have a good reputation with those outside [the church,] so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
541Tm 3:8 Deacons likewise [must be] men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,
541Tm 3:9 [but] holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
541Tm 3:10 And let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.
541Tm 3:11 Women [must] likewise [be] dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.
541Tm 3:12 Let deacons be husbands of [only] one wife, [and] good managers of [ their] children and their own households.
541Tm 3:13 For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long;
541Tm 3:15 but in case I am delayed, [I write] so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 And by common confession great is the mystery of godliness： He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Beheld by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.
541Tm 4:1 But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,
541Tm 4:2 by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,
541Tm 4:3 [men] who forbid marriage [and advocate] abstaining from foods, which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with gratitude;
541Tm 4:5 for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.
541Tm 4:6 In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, [constantly] nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following.
541Tm 4:7 But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness;
541Tm 4:8 for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and [ also] for the [life] to come.
541Tm 4:9 It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.
541Tm 4:10 For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.
541Tm 4:11 Prescribe and teach these things.
541Tm 4:12 Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but [rather] in speech, conduct, love, faith [and] purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.
541Tm 4:13 Until I come, give attention to the [public] reading [of Scripture,] to exhortation and teaching.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.
541Tm 4:15 Take pains with these things; be [absorbed] in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
541Tm 4:16 Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things; for as you do this you will insure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
541Tm 5:1 Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but [rather] appeal to [him] as a father, [to] the younger men as brothers,
541Tm 5:2 the older women as mothers, [and] the younger women as sisters, in all purity.
541Tm 5:3 Honor widows who are widows indeed;
541Tm 5:4 but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family, and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
541Tm 5:5 Now she who is a widow indeed, and who has been left alone has fixed her hope on God, and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.
541Tm 5:6 But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.
541Tm 5:7 Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.
541Tm 5:8 But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
541Tm 5:9 Let a widow be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, [having been] the wife of one man,
541Tm 5:10 having a reputation for good works; [and] if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, [and] if she has devoted herself to every good work.
541Tm 5:11 But refuse [to put] younger widows [on the list], for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,
541Tm 5:12 [thus] incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge.
541Tm 5:13 And at the same time they also learn [to be] idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper [to mention.]
541Tm 5:14 Therefore, I want younger [widows] to get married, bear children, keep house, [and] give the enemy no occasion for reproach;
541Tm 5:15 for some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If any woman who is a believer has [dependent] widows, let her assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.
541Tm 5:17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says, "YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
541Tm 5:19 Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.
541Tm 5:20 Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful [of sinning.]
541Tm 5:21 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of [His] chosen angels, to maintain these [principles] without bias, doing nothing in a [spirit of] partiality.
541Tm 5:22 Do not lay hands upon anyone [too] hastily and thus share [responsibility for] the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.
541Tm 5:23 No longer drink water [exclusively,] but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
541Tm 5:24 The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their [sins] follow after.
541Tm 5:25 Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
541Tm 6:1 Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and [our] doctrine may not be spoken against.
541Tm 6:2 And let those who have believers as their masters not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but let them serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these [principles.]
541Tm 6:3 If anyone advocates a different doctrine, and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness,
541Tm 6:4 he is conceited [and] understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,
541Tm 6:5 and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.
541Tm 6:6 But godliness [actually] is a means of great gain, when accompanied by contentment.
541Tm 6:7 For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either.
541Tm 6:8 And if we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.
541Tm 6:9 But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith, and pierced themselves with many a pang.
541Tm 6:11 But flee from these things, you man of God; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance [and] gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
541Tm 6:14 that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
541Tm 6:15 which He will bring about at the proper time-- He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords;
541Tm 6:16 who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen or can see. To Him [be] honor and eternal dominion! Amen.
541Tm 6:17 Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
541Tm 6:18 [Instruct them] to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
541Tm 6:19 storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.
541Tm 6:20 O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly [and] empty chatter [and] the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge"--
541Tm 6:21 which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you.

552Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
552Tm 1:2 to Timothy, my beloved son： Grace, mercy [and] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
552Tm 1:3 I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,
552Tm 1:4 longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.
552Tm 1:5 For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that [it is] in you as well.
552Tm 1:6 And for this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
552Tm 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.
552Tm 1:8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me His prisoner; but join with [me] in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,
552Tm 1:9 who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,
552Tm 1:10 but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
552Tm 1:11 for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.
552Tm 1:12 For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.
552Tm 1:13 Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to [you.]
552Tm 1:15 You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains;
552Tm 1:17 but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me, and found me--
552Tm 1:18 the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day-- and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
552Tm 2:1 You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:2 And the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
552Tm 2:3 Suffer hardship with [me,] as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.
552Tm 2:5 And also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.
552Tm 2:6 The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.
552Tm 2:7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
552Tm 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,
552Tm 2:9 for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.
552Tm 2:10 For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus [and] with [it] eternal glory.
552Tm 2:11 It is a trustworthy statement： For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him;
552Tm 2:12 If we endure, we shall also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;
552Tm 2:13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful; for He cannot deny Himself.
552Tm 2:14 Remind [them] of these things, and solemnly charge [them] in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless, [and leads] to the ruin of the hearers.
552Tm 2:15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the word of truth.
552Tm 2:16 But avoid worldly [and] empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,
552Tm 2:17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
552Tm 2:18 [men] who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and thus they upset the faith of some.
552Tm 2:19 Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, " The Lord knows those who are His, "and," Let everyone who names the name of the Lord abstain from wickedness. "
552Tm 2:20 Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.
552Tm 2:21 Therefore, if a man cleanses himself from these [things], he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
552Tm 2:22 Now flee from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love [and] peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
552Tm 2:23 But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.
552Tm 2:24 And the Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,
552Tm 2:25 with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,
552Tm 2:26 and they may come to their senses [and escape] from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
552Tm 3:1 But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
552Tm 3:2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
552Tm 3:3 unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,
552Tm 3:4 treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
552Tm 3:5 holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; and avoid such men as these.
552Tm 3:6 For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,
552Tm 3:7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
552Tm 3:8 And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these [men] also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected as regards the faith.
552Tm 3:9 But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, as also that of those [two] came to be.
552Tm 3:10 But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,
552Tm 3:11 persecutions, [and] sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium [and] at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me!
552Tm 3:12 And indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
552Tm 3:13 But evil men and impostors will proceed [from bad] to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
552Tm 3:14 You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned [them];
552Tm 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;
552Tm 3:17 that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
552Tm 4:1 I solemnly charge [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom：
552Tm 4:2 preach the word; be ready in season [and] out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.
552Tm 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but [wanting] to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires;
552Tm 4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.
552Tm 4:5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
552Tm 4:6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;
552Tm 4:8 in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
552Tm 4:9 Make every effort to come to me soon;
552Tm 4:10 for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens [has gone] to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
552Tm 4:12 But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
552Tm 4:13 When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
552Tm 4:15 Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.
552Tm 4:16 At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me, in order that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth.
552Tm 4:18 The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.
552Tm 4:21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.
552Tm 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
56
56Ti 1:1 Paul, a bond-servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
56Ti 1:2 in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,
56Ti 1:3 but at the proper time manifested, [even] His word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
56Ti 1:4 to Titus, my true child in a common faith： Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56Ti 1:5 For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might set in order what remains, and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,
56Ti 1:6 [namely,] if any man be above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.
56Ti 1:7 For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain,
56Ti 1:8 but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled,
56Ti 1:9 holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
56Ti 1:10 For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
56Ti 1:11 who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not [teach], for the sake of sordid gain.
56Ti 1:12 One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
56Ti 1:13 This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely that they may be sound in the faith,
56Ti 1:14 not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
56Ti 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
56Ti 1:16 They profess to know God, but by [their] deeds they deny [Him], being detestable and disobedient, and worthless for any good deed.
56Ti 2:1 But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
56Ti 2:2 Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.
56Ti 2:3 Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
56Ti 2:4 that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
56Ti 2:5 [to be] sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be dishonored.
56Ti 2:6 Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;
56Ti 2:7 in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, [with] purity in doctrine, dignified,
56Ti 2:8 sound [in] speech which is beyond reproach, in order that the opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.
56Ti 2:9 [Urge] bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
56Ti 2:10 not pilfering, but showing all good faith that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
56Ti 2:12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,
56Ti 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus;
56Ti 2:14 who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
56Ti 2:15 These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
56Ti 3:1 Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,
56Ti 3:2 to malign no one, to be uncontentious, gentle, showing every consideration for all men.
56Ti 3:3 For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
56Ti 3:4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and [His] love for mankind appeared,
56Ti 3:5 He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
56Ti 3:6 whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56Ti 3:7 that being justified by His grace we might be made heirs according to [the] hope of eternal life.
56Ti 3:8 This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.
56Ti 3:9 But shun foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law; for they are unprofitable and worthless.
56Ti 3:10 Reject a factious man after a first and second warning,
56Ti 3:11 knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.
56Ti 3:12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56Ti 3:13 Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.
56Ti 3:14 And let our [people] also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
56Ti 3:15 All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in [the] faith. Grace be with you all.

57Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved [brother] and fellow worker,
57Phm 1:2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house：
57Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57Phm 1:4 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
57Phm 1:5 because I hear of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
57Phm 1:6 [and I pray] that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake.
57Phm 1:7 For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
57Phm 1:8 Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you [ to do] that which is proper,
57Phm 1:9 yet for love's sake I rather appeal [to you]-- since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
57Phm 1:10 I appeal to you for my child, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment, Onesimus,
57Phm 1:11 who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.
57Phm 1:12 And I have sent him back to you in person, that is, [sending] my very heart,
57Phm 1:13 whom I wished to keep with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;
57Phm 1:14 but without your consent I did not want to do anything, that your goodness should not be as it were by compulsion, but of your own free will.
57Phm 1:15 For perhaps he was for this reason parted [from you] for a while, that you should have him back forever,
57Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
57Phm 1:17 If then you regard me a partner, accept him as [you would] me.
57Phm 1:18 But if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account;
57Phm 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (lest I should mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).
57Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
57Phm 1:21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.
57Phm 1:22 And at the same time also prepare me a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
57Phm 1:24 [as do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.
57Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
58
58Heb 1:1 God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,
58Heb 1:2 in these last days has spoken to us in [His] Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.
58Heb 1:3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;
58Heb 1:4 having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
58Heb 1:5 For to which of the angels did He ever say, "THOU ART MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN THEE"? And again, "I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME"?
58Heb 1:6 And when He again brings the first-born into the world, He says, " AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM. "
58Heb 1:7 And of the angels He says, "WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE."
58Heb 1:8 But of the Son [He says], "THY THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.
58Heb 1:9 "THOU HAST LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS; THEREFORE GOD, THY GOD, HATH ANOINTED THEE WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE THY COMPANIONS."
58Heb 1:10 And, "THOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING DIDST LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF THY HANDS;
58Heb 1:11 THEY WILL PERISH, BUT THOU REMAINEST; AND THEY ALL WILL BECOME OLD AS A GARMENT,
58Heb 1:12 AND AS A MANTLE THOU WILT ROLL THEM UP; AS A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT THOU ART THE SAME, AND THY YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END. "
58Heb 1:13 But to which of the angels has He ever said, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE THINE ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR THY FEET"?
58Heb 1:14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
58Heb 2:1 For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away [from it.]
58Heb 2:2 For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
58Heb 2:3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,
58Heb 2:4 God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.
58Heb 2:5 For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.
58Heb 2:6 But one has testified somewhere, saying, "WHAT IS MAN, THAT THOU REMEMBEREST HIM? OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT THOU ART CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?
58Heb 2:7 "THOU HAST MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS; THOU HAST CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAST APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF THY HANDS;
58Heb 2:8 THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. "For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.
58Heb 2:9 But we do see Him who has been made for a little while lower than the angels, [namely,] Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
58Heb 2:10 For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
58Heb 2:11 For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one [Father]; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
58Heb 2:12 saying, "I WILL PROCLAIM THY NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING THY PRAISE."
58Heb 2:13 And again, "I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM." And again, "BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME."
58Heb 2:14 Since then the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;
58Heb 2:15 and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
58Heb 2:16 For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.
58Heb 2:17 Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
58Heb 2:18 For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.
58Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.
58Heb 3:2 He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.
58Heb 3:3 For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
58Heb 3:4 For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.
58Heb 3:5 Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;
58Heb 3:6 but Christ [was faithful] as a Son over His house whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.
58Heb 3:7 Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,
58Heb 3:8 DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,
58Heb 3:9 WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED [Me] BY TESTING [Me], AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS.
58Heb 3:10 "THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION, AND SAID, 'THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART; AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS';
58Heb 3:11 AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.' "
58Heb 3:12 Take care, brethren, lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, in falling away from the living God.
58Heb 3:13 But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is [still] called "Today," lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
58Heb 3:14 For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end;
58Heb 3:15 while it is said, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME."
58Heb 3:16 For who provoked [Him] when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt [led] by Moses?
58Heb 3:17 And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
58Heb 3:18 And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?
58Heb 3:19 And [so] we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
58Heb 4:1 Therefore, let us fear lest, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.
58Heb 4:2 For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.
58Heb 4:3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, " AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST," although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
58Heb 4:4 For He has thus said somewhere concerning the seventh [day], "AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS";
58Heb 4:5 and again in this [passage], "THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST."
58Heb 4:6 Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
58Heb 4:7 He again fixes a certain day, "Today," saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, "TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS."
58Heb 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.
58Heb 4:9 There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
58Heb 4:10 For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.
58Heb 4:11 Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall through [following] the same example of disobedience.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
58Heb 4:13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
58Heb 4:14 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
58Heb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as [we are, yet] without sin.
58Heb 4:16 Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need.
58Heb 5:1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
58Heb 5:2 he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness;
58Heb 5:3 and because of it he is obligated to offer [sacrifices] for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.
58Heb 5:4 And no one takes the honor to himself, but [receives it] when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.
58Heb 5:5 So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, "THOU ART MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN THEE";
58Heb 5:6 just as He says also in another [passage], "THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK."
58Heb 5:7 In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.
58Heb 5:8 Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.
58Heb 5:9 And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,
58Heb 5:10 being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 5:11 Concerning him we have much to say, and [it is] hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
58Heb 5:12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
58Heb 5:13 For everyone who partakes [only] of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.
58Heb 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
58Heb 6:1 Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
58Heb 6:2 of instruction about washings, and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And this we shall do, if God permits.
58Heb 6:4 For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
58Heb 6:6 and [then] have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to open shame.
58Heb 6:7 For ground that drinks the rain which often falls upon it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;
58Heb 6:8 but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.
58Heb 6:9 But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.
58Heb 6:10 For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.
58Heb 6:11 And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,
58Heb 6:12 that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
58Heb 6:13 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,
58Heb 6:14 saying, "I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU, AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU."
58Heb 6:15 And thus, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.
58Heb 6:16 For men swear by one greater [than themselves], and with them an oath [given] as confirmation is an end of every dispute.
58Heb 6:17 In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,
58Heb 6:18 in order that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge in laying hold of the hope set before us.
58Heb 6:19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a [hope] both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,
58Heb 6:20 where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 7:1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
58Heb 7:2 to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all [the spoils], was first of all, by the translation [of his name], king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
58Heb 7:3 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he abides a priest perpetually.
58Heb 7:4 Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
58Heb 7:5 And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.
58Heb 7:6 But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham, and blessed the one who had the promises.
58Heb 7:7 But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
58Heb 7:8 And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one [receives them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.
58Heb 7:9 And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,
58Heb 7:10 for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
58Heb 7:11 Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need [was there] for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?
58Heb 7:12 For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.
58Heb 7:13 For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
58Heb 7:14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
58Heb 7:15 And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
58Heb 7:16 who has become [such] not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
58Heb 7:17 For it is witnessed [of Him], "THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK."
58Heb 7:18 For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
58Heb 7:19 (for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
58Heb 7:20 And inasmuch as [it was] not without an oath
58Heb 7:21 (for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, "THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, 'THOU ART A PRIEST FOREVER'");
58Heb 7:22 so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
58Heb 7:23 And the [former] priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers, because they were prevented by death from continuing,
58Heb 7:24 but He, on the other hand, because He abides forever, holds His priesthood permanently.
58Heb 7:25 Hence, also, He is able to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.
58Heb 7:26 For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;
58Heb 7:27 who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins, and then for the [sins] of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
58Heb 7:28 For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, [appoints] a Son, made perfect forever.
58Heb 8:1 Now the main point in what has been said [is this]： we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
58Heb 8:2 a minister in the sanctuary, and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
58Heb 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this [high priest] also have something to offer.
58Heb 8:4 Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;
58Heb 8:5 who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned [by God] when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "SEE," He says," THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN. "
58Heb 8:6 But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.
58Heb 8:7 For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.
58Heb 8:8 For finding fault with them, He says, "BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH;
58Heb 8:9 NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD.
58Heb 8:10 "FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD： I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM UPON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.
58Heb 8:11 "AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN, AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, 'KNOW THE LORD,' FOR ALL SHALL KNOW ME, FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM.
58Heb 8:12 "FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES, AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE."
58Heb 8:13 When He said, "A new [covenant]," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.
58Heb 9:1 Now even the first [covenant] had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
58Heb 9:2 For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which [were] the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.
58Heb 9:3 And behind the second veil, there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
58Heb 9:4 having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which [was] a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 And above it [were] the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
58Heb 9:6 Now when these things have been thus prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle, performing the divine worship,
58Heb 9:7 but into the second only the high priest [enters], once a year, not without [taking] blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.
58Heb 9:8 The Holy Spirit [is] signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed, while the outer tabernacle is still standing,
58Heb 9:9 which [is] a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,
58Heb 9:10 since they [relate] only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.
58Heb 9:11 But when Christ appeared [as] a high priest of the good things to come, [He entered] through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;
58Heb 9:12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
58Heb 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,
58Heb 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
58Heb 9:15 And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were [committed] under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
58Heb 9:16 For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.
58Heb 9:17 For a covenant is valid [only] when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.
58Heb 9:18 Therefore even the first [covenant] was not inaugurated without blood.
58Heb 9:19 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
58Heb 9:20 saying, "THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU."
58Heb 9:21 And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.
58Heb 9:22 And according to the Law, [one may] almost [say], all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58Heb 9:23 Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58Heb 9:24 For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a [mere] copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;
58Heb 9:25 nor was it that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own.
58Heb 9:26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
58Heb 9:27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this [ comes] judgment,
58Heb 9:28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time for salvation without [reference to] sin, to those who eagerly await Him.
58Heb 10:1 For the Law, since it has [only] a shadow of the good things to come [and] not the very form of things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
58Heb 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?
58Heb 10:3 But in those [sacrifices] there is a reminder of sins year by year.
58Heb 10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58Heb 10:5 Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, "SACRIFICE AND OFFERING THOU HAST NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY THOU HAST PREPARED FOR ME;
58Heb 10:6 IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND [sacrifices] FOR SIN THOU HAST TAKEN NO PLEASURE.
58Heb 10:7 "THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE ROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO THY WILL, O GOD.'"
58Heb 10:8 After saying above, "SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND [sacrifices] FOR SIN THOU HAST NOT DESIRED, NOR HAST THOU TAKEN PLEASURE [in them]" (which are offered according to the Law),
58Heb 10:9 then He said, "BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO THY WILL." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
58Heb 10:10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58Heb 10:11 And every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;
58Heb 10:12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,
58Heb 10:13 waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.
58Heb 10:14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.
58Heb 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
58Heb 10:16 "THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD： I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND UPON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM," [He then says],
58Heb 10:17 "AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE."
58Heb 10:18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer [any] offering for sin.
58Heb 10:19 Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
58Heb 10:20 by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,
58Heb 10:21 and since [we have] a great priest over the house of God,
58Heb 10:22 let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled [clean] from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;
58Heb 10:24 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,
58Heb 10:25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging [one another]; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near.
58Heb 10:26 For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
58Heb 10:27 but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment, and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.
58Heb 10:28 Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses.
58Heb 10:29 How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
58Heb 10:30 For we know Him who said, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY." And again, "THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE."
58Heb 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58Heb 10:32 But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings,
58Heb 10:33 partly, by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
58Heb 10:34 For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
58Heb 10:35 Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
58Heb 10:36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
58Heb 10:37 FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE, HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY.
58Heb 10:38 BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH; AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM.
58Heb 10:39 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul.
58Heb 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of [things] hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
58Heb 11:2 For by it the men of old gained approval.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.
58Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
58Heb 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.
58Heb 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please [Him], for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and [that] He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.
58Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned [by God] about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
58Heb 11:8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
58Heb 11:9 By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign [land], dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;
58Heb 11:10 for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58Heb 11:11 By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised;
58Heb 11:12 therefore, also, there was born of one man, and him as good as dead at that, [as many descendants] AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN IN NUMBER, AND INNUMERABLE AS THE SAND WHICH IS BY THE SEASHORE.
58Heb 11:13 All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
58Heb 11:14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
58Heb 11:15 And indeed if they had been thinking of that [country] from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
58Heb 11:16 But as it is, they desire a better [country], that is a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.
58Heb 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac; and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten [son];
58Heb 11:18 [it was he] to whom it was said, "IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED."
58Heb 11:19 He considered that God is able to raise [men] even from the dead; from which he also received him back as a type.
58Heb 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.
58Heb 11:21 By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, [leaning] on the top of his staff.
58Heb 11:22 By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
58Heb 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
58Heb 11:24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
58Heb 11:25 choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin;
58Heb 11:26 considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.
58Heb 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.
58Heb 11:28 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the first-born might not touch them.
58Heb 11:29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though [they were passing] through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.
58Heb 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.
58Heb 11:31 By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.
58Heb 11:32 And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
58Heb 11:33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed [acts of] righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
58Heb 11:35 Women received [back] their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection;
58Heb 11:36 and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
58Heb 11:38 ([men] of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
58Heb 11:39 And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
58Heb 11:40 because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
58Heb 12:1 Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance, and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
58Heb 12:2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
58Heb 12:3 For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary and lose heart.
58Heb 12:4 You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;
58Heb 12:5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, "MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;
58Heb 12:6 FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES. "
58Heb 12:7 It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom [his] father does not discipline?
58Heb 12:8 But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
58Heb 12:9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?
58Heb 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He [disciplines us] for [our] good, that we may share His holiness.
58Heb 12:11 All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.
58Heb 12:12 Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,
58Heb 12:13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that [the limb] which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
58Heb 12:14 Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;
58Heb 12:16 that [there be] no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a [single] meal.
58Heb 12:17 For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.
58Heb 12:18 For you have not come to [a mountain] that may be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,
58Heb 12:19 and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which [sound was such that] those who heard begged that no further word should be spoken to them.
58Heb 12:20 For they could not bear the command, "IF EVEN A BEAST TOUCHES THE MOUNTAIN, IT WILL BE STONED."
58Heb 12:21 And so terrible was the sight, [that] Moses said, "I AM FULL OF FEAR AND TREMBLING."
58Heb 12:22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
58Heb 12:23 to the general assembly and church of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,
58Heb 12:24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than [the blood] of Abel.
58Heb 12:25 See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned [them] on earth, much less [shall] we [escape] who turn away from Him who [warns] from heaven.
58Heb 12:26 And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, "YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN."
58Heb 12:27 And this [expression], "Yet once more," denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
58Heb 12:28 Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;
58Heb 12:29 for our God is a consuming fire.
58Heb 13:1 Let love of the brethren continue.
58Heb 13:2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.
58Heb 13:3 Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves also are in the body.
58Heb 13:4 [Let] marriage [be held] in honor among all, and let the [marriage] bed [be] undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
58Heb 13:5 Let your character be free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, "I WILL NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,"
58Heb 13:6 so that we confidently say, "THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT SHALL MAN DO TO ME?"
58Heb 13:7 Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday and today, [yes] and forever.
58Heb 13:9 Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were thus occupied were not benefited.
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar, from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
58Heb 13:11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin, are burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
58Heb 13:13 Hence, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
58Heb 13:14 For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking [the city] which is to come.
58Heb 13:15 Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.
58Heb 13:16 And do not neglect doing good and sharing; for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
58Heb 13:17 Obey your leaders, and submit [to them]; for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
58Heb 13:19 And I urge [you] all the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
58Heb 13:20 Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, [even] Jesus our Lord,
58Heb 13:21 equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.
58Heb 13:22 But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
58Heb 13:23 Take notice that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I shall see you.
58Heb 13:24 Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
58Heb 13:25 Grace be with you all.

59Jms 1:1 James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad, greetings.
59Jms 1:2 Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,
59Jms 1:3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
59Jms 1:4 And let endurance have [its] perfect result, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
59Jms 1:5 But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
59Jms 1:6 But let him ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 For let not that man expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,
59Jms 1:8 [being] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
59Jms 1:9 But let the brother of humble circumstances glory in his high position;
59Jms 1:10 and [let] the rich man [glory] in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away.
59Jms 1:11 For the sun rises with a scorching wind, and withers the grass; and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
59Jms 1:12 Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which [the Lord] has promised to those who love Him.
59Jms 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.
59Jms 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
59Jms 1:15 Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
59Jms 1:16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
59Jms 1:17 Every good thing bestowed and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation, or shifting shadow.
59Jms 1:18 In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we might be, as it were, the first fruits among His creatures.
59Jms 1:19 [This] you know, my beloved brethren. But let everyone be quick to hear, slow to speak [and] slow to anger;
59Jms 1:20 for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
59Jms 1:21 Therefore putting aside all filthiness and [all] that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.
59Jms 1:22 But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.
59Jms 1:23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;
59Jms 1:24 for [once] he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
59Jms 1:25 But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the [law] of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man shall be blessed in what he does.
59Jms 1:26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his [own] heart, this man's religion is worthless.
59Jms 1:27 This is pure and undefiled religion in the sight of [our] God and Father, to visit orphans and widows in their distress, [and] to keep oneself unstained by the world.
59Jms 2:1 My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with [an attitude of] personal favoritism.
59Jms 2:2 For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes,
59Jms 2:3 and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,"
59Jms 2:4 have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my beloved brethren： did not God choose the poor of this world [to be] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
59Jms 2:6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?
59Jms 2:7 Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called?
59Jms 2:8 If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law, according to the Scripture, "YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF," you are doing well.
59Jms 2:9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin [and] are convicted by the law as transgressors.
59Jms 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one [point,] he has become guilty of all.
59Jms 2:11 For He who said, "DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY," also said, "DO NOT COMMIT MURDER." Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
59Jms 2:12 So speak and so act, as those who are to be judged by [the] law of liberty.
59Jms 2:13 For judgment [will be] merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
59Jms 2:14 What use is it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith, but he has no works? Can that faith save him?
59Jms 2:15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,
59Jms 2:16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled," and yet you do not give them what is necessary for [their] body, what use is that?
59Jms 2:17 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, [being] by itself.
59Jms 2:18 But someone may [well] say, "You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
59Jms 2:19 You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.
59Jms 2:20 But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?
59Jms 2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
59Jms 2:22 You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;
59Jms 2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS," and he was called the friend of God.
59Jms 2:24 You see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 And in the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
59Jms 2:26 For just as the body without [the] spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
59Jms 3:1 Let not many [of you] become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we shall incur a stricter judgment.
59Jms 3:2 For we all stumble in many [ways.] If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
59Jms 3:3 Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
59Jms 3:4 Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder, wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.
59Jms 3:5 So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and [yet] it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!
59Jms 3:6 And the tongue is a fire, the [very] world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of [our] life, and is set on fire by hell.
59Jms 3:7 For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the human race.
59Jms 3:8 But no one can tame the tongue; [it is] a restless evil [and] full of deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 With it we bless [our] Lord and Father; and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God;
59Jms 3:10 from the same mouth come [both] blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
59Jms 3:11 Does a fountain send out from the same opening [both] fresh and bitter [water]?
59Jms 3:12 Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Neither [can] salt water produce fresh.
59Jms 3:13 Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
59Jms 3:14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and [so] lie against the truth.
59Jms 3:15 This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.
59Jms 3:16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing.
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
59Jms 3:18 And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
59Jms 4:1 What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
59Jms 4:2 You lust and do not have; [so] you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot obtain; [so] you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
59Jms 4:3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend [it] on your pleasures.
59Jms 4:4 You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
59Jms 4:5 Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose： "He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us"?
59Jms 4:6 But He gives a greater grace. Therefore [it] says, "GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE."
59Jms 4:7 Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
59Jms 4:8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59Jms 4:9 Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy to gloom.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
59Jms 4:11 Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge [of it.]
59Jms 4:12 There is [only] one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?
59Jms 4:13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow, we shall go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit."
59Jms 4:14 Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are [ just] a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
59Jms 4:15 Instead, [you ought] to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and also do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 Therefore, to one who knows [the] right thing to do, and does not do it, to him it is sin.
59Jms 5:1 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you.
59Jms 5:2 Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
59Jms 5:3 Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure!
59Jms 5:4 Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, [and] which has been withheld by you, cries out [against you]; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
59Jms 5:5 You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and put to death the righteous [man;] he does not resist you.
59Jms 5:7 Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.
59Jms 5:8 You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
59Jms 5:9 Do not complain, brethren, against one another, that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.
59Jms 5:10 As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:11 Behold, we count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and [is] merciful.
59Jms 5:12 But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no; so that you may not fall under judgment.
59Jms 5:13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises.
59Jms 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
59Jms 5:15 and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
59Jms 5:16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
59Jms 5:18 And he prayed again, and the sky poured rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
59Jms 5:19 My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth, and one turns him back,
59Jms 5:20 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

601Pt 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen
601Pt 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood： May grace and peace be yours in fullest measure.
601Pt 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
601Pt 1:4 to [obtain] an inheritance [which is] imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
601Pt 1:5 who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
601Pt 1:6 In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,
601Pt 1:7 that the proof of your faith, [being] more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
601Pt 1:8 and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
601Pt 1:9 obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.
601Pt 1:10 As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that [would come] to you made careful search and inquiry,
601Pt 1:11 seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
601Pt 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven-- things into which angels long to look.
601Pt 1:13 Therefore, gird your minds for action, keep sober [in spirit,] fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 1:14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts [which were yours] in your ignorance,
601Pt 1:15 but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all [your] behavior;
601Pt 1:16 because it is written, "YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY."
601Pt 1:17 And if you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each man's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay [upon earth];
601Pt 1:18 knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
601Pt 1:19 but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, [the blood] of Christ.
601Pt 1:20 For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you
601Pt 1:21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
601Pt 1:22 Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,
601Pt 1:23 for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, [that is,] through the living and abiding word of God.
601Pt 1:24 For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF,
601Pt 1:25 BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ABIDES FOREVER. "And this is the word which was preached to you.
601Pt 2:1 Therefore, putting aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,
601Pt 2:2 like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,
601Pt 2:3 if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
601Pt 2:4 And coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected by men, but choice and precious in the sight of God,
601Pt 2:5 you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
601Pt 2:6 For [this] is contained in Scripture： "BEHOLD I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER [stone], AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
601Pt 2:7 This precious value, then, is for you who believe. But for those who disbelieve, "THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER [stone,]"
601Pt 2:8 and, "A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this [doom] they were also appointed.
601Pt 2:9 But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR [God's] OWN POSSESSION, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
601Pt 2:10 for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.
601Pt 2:11 Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.
601Pt 2:12 Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may on account of your good deeds, as they observe [them,] glorify God in the day of visitation.
601Pt 2:13 Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,
601Pt 2:14 or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
601Pt 2:15 For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
601Pt 2:16 [Act] as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but [use it] as bondslaves of God.
601Pt 2:17 Honor all men; love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.
601Pt 2:18 Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
601Pt 2:19 For this [finds] favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a man bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.
601Pt 2:20 For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer [for it] you patiently endure it, this [finds] favor with God.
601Pt 2:21 For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,
601Pt 2:22 WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;
601Pt 2:23 and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;
601Pt 2:24 and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.
601Pt 2:25 For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any [of them] are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives,
601Pt 3:2 as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
601Pt 3:3 And let not your adornment be [merely] external-- braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;
601Pt 3:4 but [let it be] the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.
601Pt 3:5 For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.
601Pt 3:6 Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
601Pt 3:7 You husbands likewise, live with [your wives] in an understanding way, as with a weaker vessel, since she is a woman; and grant her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
601Pt 3:8 To sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;
601Pt 3:9 not returning evil for evil, or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.
601Pt 3:10 For, "LET HIM WHO MEANS TO LOVE LIFE AND SEE GOOD DAYS REFRAIN HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING GUILE.
601Pt 3:11 "AND LET HIM TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; LET HIM SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT.
601Pt 3:12 "FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE UPON THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL."
601Pt 3:13 And who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, [you are] blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,
601Pt 3:15 but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always [being] ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;
601Pt 3:16 and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
601Pt 3:17 For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.
601Pt 3:18 For Christ also died for sins once for all, [the] just for [the] unjust, in order that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
601Pt 3:19 in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits [now] in prison,
601Pt 3:20 who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through [the] water.
601Pt 3:21 And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you-- not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience-- through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
601Pt 3:22 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.
601Pt 4:1 Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
601Pt 4:2 so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
601Pt 4:3 For the time already past is sufficient [for you] to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousals, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.
601Pt 4:4 And in [all] this, they are surprised that you do not run with [them] into the same excess of dissipation, and they malign [you];
601Pt 4:5 but they shall give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to [the will of] God.
601Pt 4:7 The end of all things is at hand; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober [spirit] for the purpose of prayer.
601Pt 4:8 Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
601Pt 4:10 As each one has received a [special] gift, employ it in serving one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
601Pt 4:11 Whoever speaks, [let him speak,] as it were, the utterances of God; whoever serves, [let him do so] as by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you;
601Pt 4:13 but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation.
601Pt 4:14 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
601Pt 4:15 By no means let any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;
601Pt 4:16 but if [anyone suffers] as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God.
601Pt 4:17 For [it is] time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if [it begins] with us first, what [will be] the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
601Pt 4:18 AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?
601Pt 4:19 Therefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.
601Pt 5:1 Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as [your] fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,
601Pt 5:2 shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to [the will of] God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;
601Pt 5:3 nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.
601Pt 5:4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
601Pt 5:5 You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.
601Pt 5:6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,
601Pt 5:7 casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares for you.
601Pt 5:8 Be of sober [spirit,] be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
601Pt 5:9 But resist him, firm in [your] faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
601Pt 5:10 And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen [and] establish you.
601Pt 5:11 To Him [be] dominion forever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 5:12 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard [him]), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!
601Pt 5:13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and [so does] my son, Mark.
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.

612Pt 1:1 Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ：
612Pt 1:2 Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
612Pt 1:3 seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.
612Pt 1:4 For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, in order that by them you might become partakers of [the] divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.
612Pt 1:5 Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in [your] moral excellence, knowledge;
612Pt 1:6 and in [your] knowledge, self-control, and in [your] self-control, perseverance, and in [your] perseverance, godliness;
612Pt 1:7 and in [your] godliness, brotherly kindness, and in [your] brotherly kindness, love.
612Pt 1:8 For if these [qualities] are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:9 For he who lacks these [qualities] is blind [or] short-sighted, having forgotten [his] purification from his former sins.
612Pt 1:10 Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble;
612Pt 1:11 for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
612Pt 1:12 Therefore, I shall always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you [already] know [them], and have been established in the truth which is present with [you.]
612Pt 1:13 And I consider it right, as long as I am in this [earthly] dwelling, to stir you up by way of reminder,
612Pt 1:14 knowing that the laying aside of my [earthly] dwelling is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
612Pt 1:15 And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you may be able to call these things to mind.
612Pt 1:16 For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
612Pt 1:17 For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, "This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased"--
612Pt 1:18 and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
612Pt 1:19 And [so] we have the prophetic word [made] more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.
612Pt 1:20 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is [a matter] of one's own interpretation,
612Pt 1:21 for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
612Pt 2:1 But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
612Pt 2:2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;
612Pt 2:3 and in [their] greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
612Pt 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;
612Pt 2:5 and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
612Pt 2:6 and [if] He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing [them] to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter;
612Pt 2:7 and [if] He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men
612Pt 2:8 (for by what he saw and heard [that] righteous man, while living among them, felt [his] righteous soul tormented day after day with [their] lawless deeds),
612Pt 2:9 [then] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
612Pt 2:10 and especially those who indulge the flesh in [its] corrupt desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,
612Pt 2:11 whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.
612Pt 2:12 But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,
612Pt 2:13 suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you,
612Pt 2:14 having eyes full of adultery and that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;
612Pt 2:15 forsaking the right way they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the [son] of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
612Pt 2:16 but he received a rebuke for his own transgression; [for] a dumb donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.
612Pt 2:17 These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black darkness has been reserved.
612Pt 2:18 For speaking out arrogant [words] of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,
612Pt 2:19 promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.
612Pt 2:20 For if after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
612Pt 2:21 For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.
612Pt 2:22 It has happened to them according to the true proverb, "A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT," and, "A sow, after washing, [returns] to wallowing in the mire."
612Pt 3:1 This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
612Pt 3:2 that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [spoken] by your apostles.
612Pt 3:3 Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with [their] mocking, following after their own lusts,
612Pt 3:4 and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For [ever] since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation."
612Pt 3:5 For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God [the] heavens existed long ago and [the] earth was formed out of water and by water,
612Pt 3:6 through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
612Pt 3:7 But the present heavens and earth by His word are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
612Pt 3:8 But do not let this one [fact] escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.
612Pt 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.
612Pt 3:11 Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,
612Pt 3:12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, on account of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the elements will melt with intense heat!
612Pt 3:13 But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
612Pt 3:14 Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,
612Pt 3:15 and regard the patience of our Lord [to be] salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you,
612Pt 3:16 as also in all [his] letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as [they do] also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
612Pt 3:17 You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard lest, being carried away by the error of unprincipled men, you fall from your own steadfastness,
612Pt 3:18 but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

621Jn 1:1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of Life--
621Jn 1:2 and the life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us--
621Jn 1:3 what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.
621Jn 1:4 And these things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.
621Jn 1:5 And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
621Jn 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him and [yet] walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;
621Jn 1:7 but if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
621Jn 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
621Jn 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
621Jn 2:1 My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;
621Jn 2:2 and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for [those of] the whole world.
621Jn 2:3 And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.
621Jn 2:4 The one who says, "I have come to know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
621Jn 2:5 but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him：
621Jn 2:6 the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.
621Jn 2:7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard.
621Jn 2:8 On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
621Jn 2:9 The one who says he is in the light and [yet] hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
621Jn 2:10 The one who loves his brother abides in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
621Jn 2:11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
621Jn 2:12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake.
621Jn 2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.
621Jn 2:14 I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
621Jn 2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
621Jn 2:17 And the world is passing away, and [also] its lusts; but the one who does the will of God abides forever.
621Jn 2:18 Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen; from this we know that it is the last hour.
621Jn 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not [really] of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but [they went out,] in order that it might be shown that they all are not of us.
621Jn 2:20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
621Jn 2:21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
621Jn 2:22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
621Jn 2:23 Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.
621Jn 2:24 As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
621Jn 2:25 And this is the promise which He Himself made to us： eternal life.
621Jn 2:26 These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you.
621Jn 2:27 And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.
621Jn 2:28 And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.
621Jn 2:29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him.
621Jn 3:1 See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and [such] we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
621Jn 3:2 Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we shall be. We know that, when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him just as He is.
621Jn 3:3 And everyone who has this hope [fixed] on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
621Jn 3:5 And you know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.
621Jn 3:6 No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.
621Jn 3:7 Little children, let no one deceive you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous;
621Jn 3:8 the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
621Jn 3:9 No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
621Jn 3:10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious： anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.
621Jn 3:11 For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
621Jn 3:12 not as Cain, [who] was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous.
621Jn 3:13 Do not marvel, brethren, if the world hates you.
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.
621Jn 3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
621Jn 3:16 We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
621Jn 3:17 But whoever has the world's goods, and beholds his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?
621Jn 3:18 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.
621Jn 3:19 We shall know by this that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before Him,
621Jn 3:20 in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
621Jn 3:21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
621Jn 3:22 and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
621Jn 3:23 And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And we know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.
621Jn 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
621Jn 4:2 By this you know the Spirit of God： every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;
621Jn 4:3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; and this is the [spirit] of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.
621Jn 4:4 You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
621Jn 4:5 They are from the world; therefore they speak [as] from the world, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
621Jn 4:7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
621Jn 4:9 By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
621Jn 4:10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
621Jn 4:12 No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.
621Jn 4:13 By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
621Jn 4:14 And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
621Jn 4:16 And we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
621Jn 4:17 By this, love is perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world.
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.
621Jn 4:19 We love, because He first loved us.
621Jn 4:20 If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.
621Jn 4:21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.
621Jn 5:1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and whoever loves the Father loves the [child] born of Him.
621Jn 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments.
621Jn 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.
621Jn 5:4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world-- our faith.
621Jn 5:5 And who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
621Jn 5:6 This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
621Jn 5:7 And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
621Jn 5:8 For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
621Jn 5:9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for the witness of God is this, that He has borne witness concerning His Son.
621Jn 5:10 The one who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness that God has borne concerning His Son.
621Jn 5:11 And the witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
621Jn 5:12 He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
621Jn 5:13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 And this is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
621Jn 5:15 And if we know that He hears us [in] whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.
621Jn 5:16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not [leading] to death, he shall ask and [God] will for him give life to those who commit sin not [leading] to death. There is a sin [leading] to death; I do not say that he should make request for this.
621Jn 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not [leading] to death.
621Jn 5:18 We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him and the evil one does not touch him.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in [the power of] the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, in order that we might know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
621Jn 5:21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.

632Jn 1:1 The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,
632Jn 1:2 for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever：
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy [and] peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
632Jn 1:4 I was very glad to find [some] of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment [to do] from the Father.
632Jn 1:5 And now I ask you, lady, not as writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
632Jn 1:6 And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
632Jn 1:7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ [as] coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
632Jn 1:8 Watch yourselves, that you might not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward.
632Jn 1:9 Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into [your] house, and do not give him a greeting;
632Jn 1:11 for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds.
632Jn 1:12 Having many things to write to you, I do not want to [do so] with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
632Jn 1:13 The children of your chosen sister greet you.
64
643Jn 1:1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
643Jn 1:2 Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.
643Jn 1:3 For I was very glad when brethren came and bore witness to your truth, [that is,] how you are walking in truth.
643Jn 1:4 I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:5 Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially [when they are] strangers;
643Jn 1:6 and they bear witness to your love before the church; and you will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
643Jn 1:7 For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
643Jn 1:8 Therefore we ought to support such men, that we may be fellow workers with the truth.
643Jn 1:9 I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.
643Jn 1:10 For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and he forbids those who desire [to do so,] and puts [them] out of the church.
643Jn 1:11 Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
643Jn 1:12 Demetrius has received a [good] testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.
643Jn 1:13 I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write [ them] to you with pen and ink;
643Jn 1:14 but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.

65Jd 1:1 Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ：
65Jd 1:2 May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.
65Jd 1:3 Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.
65Jd 1:4 For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:5 Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe.
65Jd 1:6 And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
65Jd 1:7 Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example, in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
65Jd 1:8 Yet in the same manner these men, also by dreaming, defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.
65Jd 1:9 But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you."
65Jd 1:10 But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.
65Jd 1:11 Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
65Jd 1:12 These men are those who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;
65Jd 1:13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.
65Jd 1:14 And about these also Enoch, [in] the seventh [generation] from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of His holy ones,
65Jd 1:15 to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. "
65Jd 1:16 These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their [own] lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of [gaining an] advantage.
65Jd 1:17 But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
65Jd 1:18 that they were saying to you, "In the last time there shall be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts."
65Jd 1:19 These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.
65Jd 1:20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith; praying in the Holy Spirit;
65Jd 1:21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
65Jd 1:22 And have mercy on some, who are doubting;
65Jd 1:23 save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh.
65Jd 1:24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,
65Jd 1:25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, [be] glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

66Rv 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must shortly take place; and He sent and communicated [it] by His angel to His bond-servant John,
66Rv 1:2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, [even] to all that he saw.
66Rv 1:3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.
66Rv 1:4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia： Grace to you and peace, from Him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne;
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us, and released us from our sins by His blood,
66Rv 1:6 and He has made us [to be] a kingdom, priests to His God and Father; to Him [be] the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
66Rv 1:7 BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. Even so. Amen.
66Rv 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
66Rv 1:9 I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance [which are] in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos, because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like [the sound] of a trumpet,
66Rv 1:11 saying, "Write in a book what you see, and send [it] to the seven churches： to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."
66Rv 1:12 And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;
66Rv 1:13 and in the middle of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His breast with a golden girdle.
66Rv 1:14 And His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire;
66Rv 1:15 and His feet [were] like burnished bronze, when it has been caused to glow in a furnace, and His voice [was] like the sound of many waters.
66Rv 1:16 And in His right hand He held seven stars; and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
66Rv 1:17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as a dead man. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying, "Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,
66Rv 1:18 and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
66Rv 1:19 "Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall take place after these things.
66Rv 1:20 "As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands： the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66Rv 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write： The One who holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven golden lampstands, says this：
66Rv 2:2 'I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot endure evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them [to be] false;
66Rv 2:3 and you have perseverance and have endured for My name's sake, and have not grown weary.
66Rv 2:4 'But I have [this] against you, that you have left your first love.
66Rv 2:5 'Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you, and will remove your lampstand out of its place-- unless you repent.
66Rv 2:6 'Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66Rv 2:7 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.'
66Rv 2:8 "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write： The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life, says this：
66Rv 2:9 'I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66Rv 2:10 'Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66Rv 2:11 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.'
66Rv 2:12 "And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write： The One who has the sharp two-edged sword says this：
66Rv 2:13 'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; and you hold fast My name, and did not deny My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
66Rv 2:14 'But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit [acts of] immorality.
66Rv 2:15 'Thus you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66Rv 2:16 'Repent therefore; or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My mouth.
66Rv 2:17 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give [some] of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.'
66Rv 2:18 "And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write： The Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like burnished bronze, says this：
66Rv 2:19 'I know your deeds, and your love and faith and service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.
66Rv 2:20 'But I have [this] against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants astray, so that they commit [acts of] immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.
66Rv 2:21 'And I gave her time to repent; and she does not want to repent of her immorality.
66Rv 2:22 'Behold, I will cast her upon a bed [of sickness], and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds.
66Rv 2:23 'And I will kill her children with pestilence; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
66Rv 2:24 'But I say to you, the rest who are in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them-- I place no other burden on you.
66Rv 2:25 'Nevertheless what you have, hold fast until I come.
66Rv 2:26 'And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, TO HIM I WILL GIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONS;
66Rv 2:27 AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON, AS THE VESSELS OF THE POTTER ARE BROKEN TO PIECES, as I also have received [authority] from My Father;
66Rv 2:28 and I will give him the morning star.
66Rv 2:29 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:1 "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write： He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars, says this： 'I know your deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.
66Rv 3:2 'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My God.
66Rv 3:3 'Remember therefore what you have received and heard; and keep [it,] and repent. If therefore you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.
66Rv 3:4 'But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white; for they are worthy.
66Rv 3:5 'He who overcomes shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.
66Rv 3:6 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:7 "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write： He who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says this：
66Rv 3:8 'I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut, because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.
66Rv 3:9 'Behold, I will cause [those] of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie-- behold, I will make them to come and bow down at your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
66Rv 3:10 'Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that [hour] which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell upon the earth.
66Rv 3:11 'I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have, in order that no one take your crown.
66Rv 3:12 'He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
66Rv 3:13 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:14 "And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write： The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this：
66Rv 3:15 'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I would that you were cold or hot.
66Rv 3:16 'So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.
66Rv 3:17 'Because you say, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
66Rv 3:18 I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich, and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and [that] the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
66Rv 3:19 'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; be zealous therefore, and repent.
66Rv 3:20 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with Me.
66Rv 3:21 'He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.
66Rv 3:22 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.' "
66Rv 4:1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door [standing] open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like [the sound] of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things."
66Rv 4:2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne.
66Rv 4:3 And He who was sitting [was] like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and [there was] a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.
66Rv 4:4 And around the throne [were] twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones [I saw] twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 And from the throne proceed flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And [there were] seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
66Rv 4:6 and before the throne [there was,] as it were, a sea of glass like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
66Rv 4:7 And the first creature [was] like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature [was] like a flying eagle.
66Rv 4:8 And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, [is] THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME."
66Rv 4:9 And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,
66Rv 4:10 the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
66Rv 4:11 "Worthy art Thou, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for Thou didst create all things, and because of Thy will they existed, and were created."
66Rv 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.
66Rv 5:2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?"
66Rv 5:3 And no one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look into it.
66Rv 5:4 And I [began] to weep greatly, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look into it;
66Rv 5:5 and one of the elders *said to me, "Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals."
66Rv 5:6 And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
66Rv 5:7 And He came, and He took [it] out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
66Rv 5:8 And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66Rv 5:9 And they *sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art Thou to take the book, and to break its seals; for Thou wast slain, and didst purchase for God with Thy blood [men] from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
66Rv 5:10 "And Thou hast made them [to be] a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth."
66Rv 5:11 And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,
66Rv 5:12 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."
66Rv 5:13 And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, " To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, [be] blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever."
66Rv 5:14 And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped.
66Rv 6:1 And I saw when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, "Come."
66Rv 6:2 And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him; and he went out conquering, and to conquer.
66Rv 6:3 And when He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come."
66Rv 6:4 And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that [men] should slay one another; and a great sword was given to him.
66Rv 6:5 And when He broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come." And I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 And I heard as it were a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine."
66Rv 6:7 And when He broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come."
66Rv 6:8 And I looked, and behold, an ashen horse; and he who sat on it had the name Death; and Hades was following with him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.
66Rv 6:9 And when He broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;
66Rv 6:10 and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, wilt Thou refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
66Rv 6:11 And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until [the number of] their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, should be completed also.
66Rv 6:12 And I looked when He broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth [made] of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;
66Rv 6:13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
66Rv 6:14 And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
66Rv 6:15 And the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;
66Rv 6:16 and they *said to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb;
66Rv 6:17 for the great day of their wrath has come; and who is able to stand? "
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.
66Rv 7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,
66Rv 7:3 saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads."
66Rv 7:4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel：
66Rv 7:5 from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand [were] sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
66Rv 7:6 from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
66Rv 7:7 from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
66Rv 7:8 from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand [were] sealed.
66Rv 7:9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no one could count, from every nation and [all] tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches [were] in their hands;
66Rv 7:10 and they cry out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
66Rv 7:11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and [around] the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66Rv 7:12 saying, "Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen."
66Rv 7:13 And one of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and from where have they come?"
66Rv 7:14 And I said to him, "My lord, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66Rv 7:15 "For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne shall spread His tabernacle over them.
66Rv 7:16 "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun beat down on them, nor any heat;
66Rv 7:17 for the Lamb in the center of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them to springs of the water of life; and God shall wipe every tear from their eyes. "
66Rv 8:1 And when He broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66Rv 8:2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.
66Rv 8:3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
66Rv 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.
66Rv 8:5 And the angel took the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
66Rv 8:7 And the first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
66Rv 8:8 And the second angel sounded, and [something] like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood;
66Rv 8:9 and a third of the creatures, which were in the sea and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66Rv 8:10 And the third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters;
66Rv 8:11 and the name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
66Rv 8:12 And the fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were smitten, so that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.
66Rv 8:13 And I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"
66Rv 9:1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
66Rv 9:2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
66Rv 9:3 And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
66Rv 9:4 And they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.
66Rv 9:6 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; and they will long to die and death flees from them.
66Rv 9:7 And the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
66Rv 9:8 And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like [ the teeth] of lions.
66Rv 9:9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle.
66Rv 9:10 And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months.
66Rv 9:11 They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.
66Rv 9:12 The first woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.
66Rv 9:13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
66Rv 9:14 one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66Rv 9:15 And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they might kill a third of mankind.
66Rv 9:16 And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
66Rv 9:17 And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them： [the riders] had breastplates [the color] of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
66Rv 9:18 A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.
66Rv 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads; and with them they do harm.
66Rv 9:20 And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;
66Rv 9:21 and they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.
66Rv 10:1 And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
66Rv 10:2 and he had in his hand a little book which was open. And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;
66Rv 10:3 and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.
66Rv 10:4 And when the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken, and do not write them."
66Rv 10:5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven,
66Rv 10:6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there shall be delay no longer,
66Rv 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to His servants the prophets.
66Rv 10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven, [I heard] again speaking with me, and saying, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
66Rv 10:9 And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. And he *said to me, "Take it, and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey."
66Rv 10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
66Rv 10:11 And they *said to me, "You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings."
66Rv 11:1 And there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and someone said, "Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
66Rv 11:2 "And leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months.
66Rv 11:3 "And I will grant [authority] to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
66Rv 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66Rv 11:5 And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies; and if anyone would desire to harm them, in this manner he must be killed.
66Rv 11:6 These have the power to shut up the sky, in order that rain may not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
66Rv 11:7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them.
66Rv 11:8 And their dead bodies [will lie] in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66Rv 11:9 And those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations [will] look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
66Rv 11:10 And those who dwell on the earth [will] rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
66Rv 11:11 And after the three and a half days the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were beholding them.
66Rv 11:12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.
66Rv 11:13 And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; and seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66Rv 11:14 The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
66Rv 11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there arose loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become [the kingdom] of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever."
66Rv 11:16 And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66Rv 11:17 saying, "We give Thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast, because Thou hast taken Thy great power and hast begun to reign.
66Rv 11:18 "And the nations were enraged, and Thy wrath came, and the time [came] for the dead to be judged, and [the time] to give their reward to Thy bond-servants the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
66Rv 11:19 And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
66Rv 12:1 And a great sign appeared in heaven： a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;
66Rv 12:2 and she was with child; and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth.
66Rv 12:3 And another sign appeared in heaven： and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads [were] seven diadems.
66Rv 12:4 And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.
66Rv 12:5 And she gave birth to a son, a male [child], who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
66Rv 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she might be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
66Rv 12:7 And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. And the dragon and his angels waged war,
66Rv 12:8 and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
66Rv 12:9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
66Rv 12:10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
66Rv 12:11 "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even to death.
66Rv 12:12 "For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has [only] a short time."
66Rv 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male [child.]
66Rv 12:14 And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, in order that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.
66Rv 12:15 And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.
66Rv 12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.
66Rv 12:17 And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
66Rv 13:1 And he stood on the sand of the seashore. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns [were] ten diadems, and on his heads [were] blasphemous names.
66Rv 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like [those] of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.
66Rv 13:3 And [I saw] one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed [and followed] after the beast;
66Rv 13:4 and they worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?"
66Rv 13:5 And there was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies; and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.
66Rv 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, [that is], those who dwell in heaven.
66Rv 13:7 And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.
66Rv 13:8 And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, [everyone] whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.
66Rv 13:9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
66Rv 13:10 If anyone [is destined] for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.
66Rv 13:11 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
66Rv 13:13 And he performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.
66Rv 13:14 And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life.
66Rv 13:15 And there was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast might even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
66Rv 13:16 And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead,
66Rv 13:17 and [he provides] that no one should be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, [either] the name of the beast or the number of his name.
66Rv 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
66Rv 14:1 And I looked, and behold, the Lamb [was] standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard [was] like [the sound] of harpists playing on their harps.
66Rv 14:3 And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These [are] the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.
66Rv 14:5 And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.
66Rv 14:6 And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
66Rv 14:7 and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters."
66Rv 14:8 And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality."
66Rv 14:9 And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand,
66Rv 14:10 he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
66Rv 14:11 "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."
66Rv 14:12 Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
66Rv 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!'" "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them."
66Rv 14:14 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud [was] one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head, and a sharp sickle in His hand.
66Rv 14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, "Put in your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66Rv 14:16 And He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth; and the earth was reaped.
66Rv 14:17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
66Rv 14:18 And another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Put in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe."
66Rv 14:19 And the angel swung his sickle to the earth, and gathered [the clusters from] the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.
66Rv 14:20 And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance of two hundred miles.
66Rv 15:1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, [which are] the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.
66Rv 15:2 And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.
66Rv 15:3 And they *sang the song of Moses the bond-servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the nations.
66Rv 15:4 "Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou alone art holy; For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE THEE, For Thy righteous acts have been revealed."
66Rv 15:5 After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,
66Rv 15:6 and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean [and] bright, and girded around their breasts with golden girdles.
66Rv 15:7 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
66Rv 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
66Rv 16:1 And I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth."
66Rv 16:2 And the first [angel] went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.
66Rv 16:3 And the second [angel] poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like [that] of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.
66Rv 16:4 And the third [angel] poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.
66Rv 16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Righteous art Thou, who art and who wast, O Holy One, because Thou didst judge these things;
66Rv 16:6 for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to drink. They deserve it. "
66Rv 16:7 And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judgments."
66Rv 16:8 And the fourth [angel] poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to scorch men with fire.
66Rv 16:9 And men were scorched with fierce heat; and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues; and they did not repent, so as to give Him glory.
66Rv 16:10 And the fifth [angel] poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain,
66Rv 16:11 and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they did not repent of their deeds.
66Rv 16:12 And the sixth [angel] poured out his bowl upon the great river, the Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings from the east.
66Rv 16:13 And I saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;
66Rv 16:14 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 ("Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments, lest he walk about naked and men see his shame.")
66Rv 16:16 And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-magedon.
66Rv 16:17 And the seventh [angel] poured out his bowl upon the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is done."
66Rv 16:18 And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake [was it, and] so mighty.
66Rv 16:19 And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of His fierce wrath.
66Rv 16:20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
66Rv 16:21 And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe.
66Rv 17:1 And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I shall show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
66Rv 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth committed [acts of] immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality. "
66Rv 17:3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
66Rv 17:4 And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,
66Rv 17:5 and upon her forehead a name [was] written, a mystery, "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66Rv 17:6 And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered greatly.
66Rv 17:7 And the angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I shall tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
66Rv 17:8 "The beast that you saw was and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.
66Rv 17:9 "Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits,
66Rv 17:10 and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.
66Rv 17:11 "And the beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is [one] of the seven, and he goes to destruction.
66Rv 17:12 "And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.
66Rv 17:13 "These have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast.
66Rv 17:14 "These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him [are the] called and chosen and faithful."
66Rv 17:15 And he *said to me, "The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
66Rv 17:16 "And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.
66Rv 17:17 "For God has put it in their hearts to execute His purpose by having a common purpose, and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be fulfilled.
66Rv 17:18 "And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
66Rv 18:1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory.
66Rv 18:2 And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! And she has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.
66Rv 18:3 "For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed [acts of] immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality."
66Rv 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you may not participate in her sins and that you may not receive of her plagues;
66Rv 18:5 for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
66Rv 18:6 "Pay her back even as she has paid, and give back [to her] double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.
66Rv 18:7 "To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ' I SIT [as] A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.'
66Rv 18:8 "For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.
66Rv 18:9 "And the kings of the earth, who committed [acts of] immorality and lived sensuously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,
66Rv 18:10 standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, ' Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come. '
66Rv 18:11 "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more;
66Rv 18:12 cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every [kind of] citron wood and every article of ivory and every article [made] from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble,
66Rv 18:13 and cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and [cargoes] of horses and chariots and slaves and human lives.
66Rv 18:14 "And the fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you and [men] will no longer find them.
66Rv 18:15 "The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
66Rv 18:16 saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;
66Rv 18:17 for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste! 'And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance,
66Rv 18:18 and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ' What [city] is like the great city? '
66Rv 18:19 "And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!'
66Rv 18:20 "Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her."
66Rv 18:21 And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer.
66Rv 18:22 "And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer;
66Rv 18:23 and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.
66Rv 18:24 "And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth."
66Rv 19:1 After these things I heard, as it were, a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God;
66Rv 19:2 BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS Bond-servants ON HER. "
66Rv 19:3 And a second time they said, "Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER."
66Rv 19:4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!"
66Rv 19:5 And a voice came from the throne, saying, "Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him, the small and the great."
66Rv 19:6 And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude and as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying, " Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
66Rv 19:7 "Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready."
66Rv 19:8 And it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright [and] clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
66Rv 19:9 And he *said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" And he *said to me, "These are true words of God."
66Rv 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he *said to me, "Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66Rv 19:11 And I saw heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and He who sat upon it [is] called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He judges and wages war.
66Rv 19:12 And His eyes [are] a flame of fire, and upon His head [are] many diadems; and He has a name written [upon Him] which no one knows except Himself.
66Rv 19:13 And [He is] clothed with a robe dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white [ and] clean, were following Him on white horses.
66Rv 19:15 And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may smite the nations; and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.
66Rv 19:16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
66Rv 19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, "Come, assemble for the great supper of God;
66Rv 19:18 in order that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great. "
66Rv 19:19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, assembled to make war against Him who sat upon the horse, and against His army.
66Rv 19:20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.
66Rv 19:21 And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat upon the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
66Rv 20:1 And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
66Rv 20:2 And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
66Rv 20:3 and threw him into the abyss, and shut [it] and sealed [it] over him, so that he should not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.
66Rv 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I [saw] the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
66Rv 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:7 And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,
66Rv 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.
66Rv 20:9 And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
66Rv 20:10 And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66Rv 20:11 And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
66Rv 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.
66Rv 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one [ of them] according to their deeds.
66Rv 20:14 And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
66Rv 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
66Rv 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer [any] sea.
66Rv 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He shall dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be among them,
66Rv 21:4 and He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall no longer be [any] death; there shall no longer be [any] mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away. "
66Rv 21:5 And He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He *said, "Write, for these words are faithful and true."
66Rv 21:6 And He said to me, "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.
66Rv 21:7 "He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.
66Rv 21:8 "But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part [will be] in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
66Rv 21:9 And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here, I shall show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66Rv 21:10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
66Rv 21:11 having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.
66Rv 21:12 It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names [were] written on them, which are [those] of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
66Rv 21:13 [There were] three gates on the east and three gates on the north and three gates on the south and three gates on the west.
66Rv 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them [were] the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66Rv 21:15 And the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall.
66Rv 21:16 And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.
66Rv 21:17 And he measured its wall, seventy-two yards, [according to] human measurements, which are [also] angelic [measurements.]
66Rv 21:18 And the material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
66Rv 21:19 The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
66Rv 21:20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
66Rv 21:22 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.
66Rv 21:23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp [is] the Lamb.
66Rv 21:24 And the nations shall walk by its light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it.
66Rv 21:25 And in the daytime (for there shall be no night there) its gates shall never be closed;
66Rv 21:26 and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it;
66Rv 21:27 and nothing unclean and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66Rv 22:1 And he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
66Rv 22:2 in the middle of its street. And on either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve [kinds of] fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
66Rv 22:3 And there shall no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His bond-servants shall serve Him;
66Rv 22:4 and they shall see His face, and His name [shall be] on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 And there shall no longer be [any] night; and they shall not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God shall illumine them; and they shall reign forever and ever.
66Rv 22:6 And he said to me, "These words are faithful and true"; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must shortly take place.
66Rv 22:7 "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book."
66Rv 22:8 And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
66Rv 22:9 And he *said to me, "Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book; worship God."
66Rv 22:10 And he *said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 "Let the one who does wrong, still do wrong; and let the one who is filthy, still be filthy; and let the one who is righteous, still practice righteousness; and let the one who is holy, still keep himself holy."
66Rv 22:12 "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward [is] with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.
66Rv 22:13 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
66Rv 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.
66Rv 22:15 Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star."
66Rv 22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.
66Rv 22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book： if anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book;
66Rv 22:19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.
66Rv 22:20 He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming quickly." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
66Rv 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
