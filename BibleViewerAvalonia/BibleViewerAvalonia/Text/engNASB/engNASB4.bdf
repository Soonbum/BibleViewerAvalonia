18
18¿é 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job, and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil.
18¿é 1:2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
18¿é 1:3 His possessions also were 70000 sheep, 30000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
18¿é 1:4 And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18¿é 1:5 And it came about, when the days of feasting had completed their cycle, that Job would send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings [according to] the number of them all; for Job said, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.
18¿é 1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
18¿é 1:7 And the LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it."
18¿é 1:8 And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil."
18¿é 1:9 Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18¿é 1:10 "Hast Thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18¿é 1:11 "But put forth Thy hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse Thee to Thy face."
18¿é 1:12 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD.
18¿é 1:13 Now it happened on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
18¿é 1:14 that a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
18¿é 1:15 and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. "
18¿é 1:16 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:17 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18¿é 1:18 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
18¿é 1:19 and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to tell you. "
18¿é 1:20 Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped.
18¿é 1:21 And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD."
18¿é 1:22 Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.
18¿é 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
18¿é 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, "From roaming about on the earth, and walking around on it."
18¿é 2:3 And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to ruin him without cause."
18¿é 2:4 And Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.
18¿é 2:5 "However, put forth Thy hand, now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse Thee to Thy face."
18¿é 2:6 So the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life."
18¿é 2:7 Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
18¿é 2:8 And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes.
18¿é 2:9 Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die!"
18¿é 2:10 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
18¿é 2:11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him.
18¿é 2:12 And when they lifted up their eyes at a distance, and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky.
18¿é 2:13 Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that [his] pain was very great.
18¿é 3:1 Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his [birth.]
18¿é 3:2 And Job said,
18¿é 3:3 "Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night [which] said, 'A boy is conceived.'
18¿é 3:4 "May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it.
18¿é 3:5 "Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
18¿é 3:6 "[As for] that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.
18¿é 3:7 "Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it.
18¿é 3:8 "Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.
18¿é 3:9 "Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; Let it wait for light but have none, Neither let it see the breaking dawn;
18¿é 3:10 Because it did not shut the opening of my [mother's] womb, Or hide trouble from my eyes.
18¿é 3:11 "Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and expire?
18¿é 3:12 "Why did the knees receive me, And why the breasts, that I should suck?
18¿é 3:13 "For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept then, I would have been at rest,
18¿é 3:14 With kings and [with] counselors of the earth, Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;
18¿é 3:15 Or with princes who had gold, Who were filling their houses [with] silver.
18¿é 3:16 "Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light.
18¿é 3:17 "There the wicked cease from raging, And there the weary are at rest.
18¿é 3:18 "The prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.
18¿é 3:19 "The small and the great are there, And the slave is free from his master.
18¿é 3:20 "Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the bitter of soul;
18¿é 3:21 Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;
18¿é 3:22 Who rejoice greatly, They exult when they find the grave?
18¿é 3:23 "[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in?
18¿é 3:24 "For my groaning comes at the sight of my food, And my cries pour out like water.
18¿é 3:25 "For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls me.
18¿é 3:26 "I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes."
18¿é 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
18¿é 4:2 "If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient? But who can refrain from speaking?
18¿é 4:3 "Behold you have admonished many, And you have strengthened weak hands.
18¿é 4:4 "Your words have helped the tottering to stand, And you have strengthened feeble knees.
18¿é 4:5 "But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; It touches you, and you are dismayed.
18¿é 4:6 "Is not your fear [of God] your confidence, And the integrity of your ways your hope?
18¿é 4:7 "Remember now, who [ever] perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?
18¿é 4:8 "According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity And those who sow trouble harvest it.
18¿é 4:9 "By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.
18¿é 4:10 "The roaring of the lion and the voice of the [fierce] lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken.
18¿é 4:11 "The lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.
18¿é 4:12 "Now a word was brought to me stealthily, And my ear received a whisper of it.
18¿é 4:13 "Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,
18¿é 4:14 Dread came upon me, and trembling, And made all my bones shake.
18¿é 4:15 "Then a spirit passed by my face; The hair of my flesh bristled up.
18¿é 4:16 "It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form [was] before my eyes; [There was] silence, then I heard a voice£º
18¿é 4:17 'Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?
18¿é 4:18 'He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error.
18¿é 4:19 'How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!
18¿é 4:20 'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces; Unobserved, they perish forever.
18¿é 4:21 'Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, yet without wisdom.'
18¿é 5:1 "Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
18¿é 5:2 "For vexation slays the foolish man, And anger kills the simple.
18¿é 5:3 "I have seen the foolish taking root, And I cursed his abode immediately.
18¿é 5:4 "His sons are far from safety, They are even oppressed in the gate, Neither is there a deliverer.
18¿é 5:5 "His harvest the hungry devour, And take it to a [place of] thorns; And the schemer is eager for their wealth.
18¿é 5:6 "For affliction does not come from the dust, Neither does trouble sprout from the ground,
18¿é 5:7 For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly upward.
18¿é 5:8 "But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my cause before God;
18¿é 5:9 Who does great and unsearchable things, Wonders without number.
18¿é 5:10 "He gives rain on the earth, And sends water on the fields,
18¿é 5:11 So that He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety.
18¿é 5:12 "He frustrates the plotting of the shrewd, So that their hands cannot attain success.
18¿é 5:13 "He captures the wise by their own shrewdness And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted.
18¿é 5:14 "By day they meet with darkness, And grope at noon as in the night.
18¿é 5:15 "But He saves from the sword of their mouth, And the poor from the hand of the mighty.
18¿é 5:16 "So the helpless has hope, And unrighteousness must shut its mouth.
18¿é 5:17 "Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18¿é 5:18 "For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, and His hands [ also] heal.
18¿é 5:19 "From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil will not touch you.
18¿é 5:20 "In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword.
18¿é 5:21 "You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, Neither will you be afraid of violence when it comes.
18¿é 5:22 "You will laugh at violence and famine, Neither will you be afraid of wild beasts.
18¿é 5:23 "For you will be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
18¿é 5:24 "And you will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit your abode and fear no loss.
18¿é 5:25 "You will know also that your descendants will be many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth.
18¿é 5:26 "You will come to the grave in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season.
18¿é 5:27 "Behold this, we have investigated it, thus it is; Hear it, and know for yourself."
18¿é 6:1 Then Job answered,
18¿é 6:2 "Oh that my vexation were actually weighed, And laid in the balances together with my iniquity!
18¿é 6:3 "For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, Therefore my words have been rash.
18¿é 6:4 "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; Their poison my spirit drinks; The terrors of God are arrayed against me.
18¿é 6:5 "Does the wild donkey bray over [his] grass, Or does the ox low over his fodder?
18¿é 6:6 "Can something tasteless be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
18¿é 6:7 "My soul refuses to touch [them;] They are like loathsome food to me.
18¿é 6:8 "Oh that my request might come to pass, And that God would grant my longing!
18¿é 6:9 "Would that God were willing to crush me; That He would loose His hand and cut me off!
18¿é 6:10 "But it is still my consolation, And I rejoice in unsparing pain, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18¿é 6:11 "What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should endure?
18¿é 6:12 "Is my strength the strength of stones, Or is my flesh bronze?
18¿é 6:13 "Is it that my help is not within me, And that deliverance is driven from me?
18¿é 6:14 "For the despairing man [there should be] kindness from his friend; Lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty.
18¿é 6:15 "My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi, Like the torrents of wadis which vanish,
18¿é 6:16 Which are turbid because of ice, [And] into which the snow melts.
18¿é 6:17 "When they become waterless, they are silent, When it is hot, they vanish from their place.
18¿é 6:18 "The paths of their course wind along, They go up into nothing and perish.
18¿é 6:19 "The caravans of Tema looked, The travelers of Sheba hoped for them.
18¿é 6:20 "They were disappointed for they had trusted, They came there and were confounded.
18¿é 6:21 "Indeed, you have now become such, You see a terror and are afraid.
18¿é 6:22 "Have I said, 'Give me [something,'] Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,'
18¿é 6:23 Or, 'Deliver me from the hand of the adversary,' Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'?
18¿é 6:24 "Teach me, and I will be silent; And show me how I have erred.
18¿é 6:25 "How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?
18¿é 6:26 "Do you intend to reprove [my] words, When the words of one in despair belong to the wind?
18¿é 6:27 "You would even cast [lots] for the orphans, And barter over your friend.
18¿é 6:28 "And now please look at me, And [see] if I lie to your face.
18¿é 6:29 "Desist now, let there be no injustice; Even desist, my righteousness is yet in it.
18¿é 6:30 "Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern calamities?
18¿é 7:1 "Is not man forced to labor on earth, And [are not] his days like the days of a hired man?
18¿é 7:2 "As a slave who pants for the shade, And as a hired man who eagerly waits for his wages,
18¿é 7:3 So am I allotted months of vanity, And nights of trouble are appointed me.
18¿é 7:4 "When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night continues, And I am continually tossing until dawn.
18¿é 7:5 "My flesh is clothed with worms and a crust of dirt; My skin hardens and runs.
18¿é 7:6 "My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And come to an end without hope.
18¿é 7:7 "Remember that my life is [but] breath, My eye will not again see good.
18¿é 7:8 "The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; Thine eyes [will be] on me, but I will not be.
18¿é 7:9 "When a cloud vanishes, it is gone, So he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.
18¿é 7:10 "He will not return again to his house, Nor will his place know him anymore.
18¿é 7:11 "Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18¿é 7:12 "Am I the sea, or the sea monster, That Thou dost set a guard over me?
18¿é 7:13 "If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,'
18¿é 7:14 Then Thou dost frighten me with dreams And terrify me by visions;
18¿é 7:15 So that my soul would choose suffocation, Death rather than my pains.
18¿é 7:16 "I waste away; I will not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are [but] a breath.
18¿é 7:17 "What is man that Thou dost magnify him, And that Thou art concerned about him,
18¿é 7:18 That Thou dost examine him every morning, And try him every moment?
18¿é 7:19 "Wilt Thou never turn Thy gaze away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
18¿é 7:20 "Have I sinned? What have I done to Thee, O watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as Thy target, So that I am a burden to myself?
18¿é 7:21 "Why then dost Thou not pardon my transgression And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And Thou wilt seek me, but I will not be."
18¿é 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
18¿é 8:2 "How long will you say these [things,] And the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
18¿é 8:3 "Does God pervert justice Or does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18¿é 8:4 "If your sons sinned against Him, Then He delivered them into the power of their transgression.
18¿é 8:5 "If you would seek God And implore the compassion of the Almighty,
18¿é 8:6 If you are pure and upright, Surely now He would rouse Himself for you And restore your righteous estate.
18¿é 8:7 "Though your beginning was insignificant, Yet your end will increase greatly.
18¿é 8:8 "Please inquire of past generations, And consider the things searched out by their fathers.
18¿é 8:9 "For we are [only] of yesterday and know nothing, Because our days on earth are as a shadow.
18¿é 8:10 "Will they not teach you [and] tell you, And bring forth words from their minds?
18¿é 8:11 "Can the papyrus grow up without marsh? Can the rushes grow without water?
18¿é 8:12 "While it is still green [and] not cut down, Yet it withers before any [other] plant.
18¿é 8:13 "So are the paths of all who forget God, And the hope of the godless will perish,
18¿é 8:14 Whose confidence is fragile, And whose trust a spider's web.
18¿é 8:15 "He trusts in his house, but it does not stand; He holds fast to it, but it does not endure.
18¿é 8:16 "He thrives before the sun, And his shoots spread out over his garden.
18¿é 8:17 "His roots wrap around a rock pile, He grasps a house of stones.
18¿é 8:18 "If he is removed from his place, Then it will deny him, [saying,] ' I never saw you. '
18¿é 8:19 "Behold, this is the joy of His way; And out of the dust others will spring.
18¿é 8:20 "Lo, God will not reject [a man of] integrity, Nor will He support the evildoers.
18¿é 8:21 "He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, And your lips with shouting.
18¿é 8:22 "Those who hate you will be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked will be no more."
18¿é 9:1 Then Job answered,
18¿é 9:2 "In truth I know that this is so, But how can a man be in the right before God?
18¿é 9:3 "If one wished to dispute with Him, He could not answer Him once in a thousand [times.]
18¿é 9:4 "Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has defied Him without harm?
18¿é 9:5 "[It is God] who removes the mountains, they know not [how,] When He overturns them in His anger;
18¿é 9:6 Who shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble;
18¿é 9:7 Who commands the sun not to shine, And sets a seal upon the stars;
18¿é 9:8 Who alone stretches out the heavens, And tramples down the waves of the sea;
18¿é 9:9 Who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;
18¿é 9:10 Who does great things, unfathomable, And wondrous works without number.
18¿é 9:11 "Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; Were He to move past [ me,] I would not perceive Him.
18¿é 9:12 "Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say to Him, 'What art Thou doing?'
18¿é 9:13 "God will not turn back His anger; Beneath Him crouch the helpers of Rahab.
18¿é 9:14 "How then can I answer Him, [And] choose my words before Him?
18¿é 9:15 "For though I were right, I could not answer; I would have to implore the mercy of my judge.
18¿é 9:16 "If I called and He answered me, I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.
18¿é 9:17 "For He bruises me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause.
18¿é 9:18 "He will not allow me to get my breath, But saturates me with bitterness.
18¿é 9:19 "If [it is a matter] of power, behold, [He is] the strong one! And if [it is a matter] of justice, who can summon Him?
18¿é 9:20 "Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; Though I am guiltless, He will declare me guilty.
18¿é 9:21 "I am guiltless; I do not take notice of myself; I despise my life.
18¿é 9:22 "It is [all] one; therefore I say, 'He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.'
18¿é 9:23 "If the scourge kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
18¿é 9:24 "The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If [it is] not [He,] then who is it?
18¿é 9:25 "Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.
18¿é 9:26 "They slip by like reed boats, Like an eagle that swoops on its prey.
18¿é 9:27 "Though I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my [sad] countenance and be cheerful,'
18¿é 9:28 I am afraid of all my pains, I know that Thou wilt not acquit me.
18¿é 9:29 "I am accounted wicked, Why then should I toil in vain?
18¿é 9:30 "If I should wash myself with snow And cleanse my hands with lye,
18¿é 9:31 Yet Thou wouldst plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes would abhor me.
18¿é 9:32 "For [He is] not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That we may go to court together.
18¿é 9:33 "There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand upon us both.
18¿é 9:34 "Let Him remove His rod from me, And let not dread of Him terrify me.
18¿é 9:35 "[Then] I would speak and not fear Him; But I am not like that in myself.
18¿é 10:1 "I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18¿é 10:2 "I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Let me know why Thou dost contend with me.
18¿é 10:3 'Is it right for Thee indeed to oppress, To reject the labor of Thy hands, And to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?
18¿é 10:4 'Hast Thou eyes of flesh? Or dost Thou see as a man sees?
18¿é 10:5 'Are Thy days as the days of a mortal, Or Thy years as man's years,
18¿é 10:6 That Thou shouldst seek for my guilt, And search after my sin?
18¿é 10:7 'According to Thy knowledge I am indeed not guilty; Yet there is no deliverance from Thy hand.
18¿é 10:8 'Thy hands fashioned and made me altogether, And wouldst Thou destroy me?
18¿é 10:9 'Remember now, that Thou hast made me as clay; And wouldst Thou turn me into dust again?
18¿é 10:10 'Didst Thou not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese;
18¿é 10:11 Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews?
18¿é 10:12 'Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And Thy care has preserved my spirit.
18¿é 10:13 'Yet these things Thou hast concealed in Thy heart; I know that this is within Thee£º
18¿é 10:14 If I sin, then Thou wouldst take note of me, And wouldst not acquit me of my guilt.
18¿é 10:15 'If I am wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. [I am] sated with disgrace and conscious of my misery.
18¿é 10:16 'And should [my head] be lifted up, Thou wouldst hunt me like a lion; And again Thou wouldst show Thy power against me.
18¿é 10:17 'Thou dost renew Thy witnesses against me, And increase Thine anger toward me, Hardship after hardship is with me.
18¿é 10:18 'Why then hast Thou brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me!
18¿é 10:19 'I should have been as though I had not been, Carried from womb to tomb.'
18¿é 10:20 "Would He not let my few days alone? Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer
18¿é 10:21 Before I go-- and I shall not return-- To the land of darkness and deep shadow;
18¿é 10:22 The land of utter gloom as darkness [itself,] Of deep shadow without order, And which shines as the darkness. "
18¿é 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
18¿é 11:2 "Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted?
18¿é 11:3 "Shall your boasts silence men? And shall you scoff and none rebuke?
18¿é 11:4 "For you have said, 'My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.'
18¿é 11:5 "But would that God might speak, And open His lips against you,
18¿é 11:6 And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.
18¿é 11:7 "Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?
18¿é 11:8 "[They are] high as the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol, what can you know?
18¿é 11:9 "Its measure is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.
18¿é 11:10 "If He passes by or shuts up, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him?
18¿é 11:11 "For He knows false men, And He sees iniquity without investigating.
18¿é 11:12 "And an idiot will become intelligent When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man.
18¿é 11:13 "If you would direct your heart right, And spread out your hand to Him;
18¿é 11:14 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents.
18¿é 11:15 "Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without [moral] defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear.
18¿é 11:16 "For you would forget [your] trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember [it.]
18¿é 11:17 "And your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning.
18¿é 11:18 "Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely.
18¿é 11:19 "You would lie down and none would disturb [you,] And many would entreat your favor.
18¿é 11:20 "But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And there will be no escape for them; And their hope is to breathe their last."
18¿é 12:1 Then Job responded,
18¿é 12:2 "Truly then you are the people, And with you wisdom will die!
18¿é 12:3 "But I have intelligence as well as you; I am not inferior to you. And who does not know such things as these?
18¿é 12:4 "I am a joke to my friends. The one who called on God, and He answered him; The just [and] blameless [man] is a joke.
18¿é 12:5 "He who is at ease holds calamity in contempt, As prepared for those whose feet slip.
18¿é 12:6 "The tents of the destroyers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure, Whom God brings into their power.
18¿é 12:7 "But now ask the beasts, and let them teach you; And the birds of the heavens, and let them tell you.
18¿é 12:8 "Or speak to the earth, and let it teach you; And let the fish of the sea declare to you.
18¿é 12:9 "Who among all these does not know That the hand of the LORD has done this,
18¿é 12:10 In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind?
18¿é 12:11 "Does not the ear test words, As the palate tastes its food?
18¿é 12:12 "Wisdom is with aged men, [With] long life is understanding.
18¿é 12:13 "With Him are wisdom and might; To Him belong counsel and understanding.
18¿é 12:14 "Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
18¿é 12:15 "Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up; And He sends them out, and they inundate the earth.
18¿é 12:16 "With Him are strength and sound wisdom, The misled and the misleader belong to Him.
18¿é 12:17 "He makes counselors walk barefoot, And makes fools of judges.
18¿é 12:18 "He loosens the bond of kings, And binds their loins with a girdle.
18¿é 12:19 "He makes priests walk barefoot, And overthrows the secure ones.
18¿é 12:20 "He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders.
18¿é 12:21 "He pours contempt on nobles, And loosens the belt of the strong.
18¿é 12:22 "He reveals mysteries from the darkness, And brings the deep darkness into light.
18¿é 12:23 "He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.
18¿é 12:24 "He deprives of intelligence the chiefs of the earth's people, And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
18¿é 12:25 "They grope in darkness with no light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
18¿é 13:1 "Behold, my eye has seen all [this,] My ear has heard and understood it.
18¿é 13:2 "What you know I also know. I am not inferior to you.
18¿é 13:3 "But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to argue with God.
18¿é 13:4 "But you smear with lies; You are all worthless physicians.
18¿é 13:5 "O that you would be completely silent, And that it would become your wisdom!
18¿é 13:6 "Please hear my argument, And listen to the contentions of my lips.
18¿é 13:7 "Will you speak what is unjust for God, And speak what is deceitful for Him?
18¿é 13:8 "Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God?
18¿é 13:9 "Will it be well when He examines you? Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?
18¿é 13:10 "He will surely reprove you, If you secretly show partiality.
18¿é 13:11 "Will not His majesty terrify you, And the dread of Him fall on you?
18¿é 13:12 "Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.
18¿é 13:13 "Be silent before me so that I may speak; Then let come on me what may.
18¿é 13:14 "Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hands?
18¿é 13:15 "Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.
18¿é 13:16 "This also will be my salvation, For a godless man may not come before His presence.
18¿é 13:17 "Listen carefully to my speech, And let my declaration [fill] your ears.
18¿é 13:18 "Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.
18¿é 13:19 "Who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die.
18¿é 13:20 "Only two things do not do to me, Then I will not hide from Thy face£º
18¿é 13:21 Remove Thy hand from me, And let not the dread of Thee terrify me.
18¿é 13:22 "Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then reply to me.
18¿é 13:23 "How many are my iniquities and sins? Make known to me my rebellion and my sin.
18¿é 13:24 "Why dost Thou hide Thy face, And consider me Thine enemy?
18¿é 13:25 "Wilt Thou cause a driven leaf to tremble? Or wilt Thou pursue the dry chaff?
18¿é 13:26 "For Thou dost write bitter things against me, And dost make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
18¿é 13:27 "Thou dost put my feet in the stocks, And dost watch all my paths; Thou dost set a limit for the soles of my feet,
18¿é 13:28 While I am decaying like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
18¿é 14:1 "Man, who is born of woman, Is short-lived and full of turmoil.
18¿é 14:2 "Like a flower he comes forth and withers. He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.
18¿é 14:3 "Thou also dost open Thine eyes on him, And bring him into judgment with Thyself.
18¿é 14:4 "Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!
18¿é 14:5 "Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with Thee, And his limits Thou hast set so that he cannot pass.
18¿é 14:6 "Turn Thy gaze from him that he may rest, Until he fulfills his day like a hired man.
18¿é 14:7 "For there is hope for a tree, When it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail.
18¿é 14:8 "Though its roots grow old in the ground, And its stump dies in the dry soil,
18¿é 14:9 At the scent of water it will flourish And put forth sprigs like a plant.
18¿é 14:10 "But man dies and lies prostrate. Man expires, and where is he?
18¿é 14:11 "[As] water evaporates from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dried up,
18¿é 14:12 So man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens be no more, He will not awake nor be aroused out of his sleep.
18¿é 14:13 "Oh that Thou wouldst hide me in Sheol, That Thou wouldst conceal me until Thy wrath returns [to Thee,] That Thou wouldst set a limit for me and remember me!
18¿é 14:14 "If a man dies, will he live [again?] All the days of my struggle I will wait, Until my change comes.
18¿é 14:15 "Thou wilt call, and I will answer Thee; Thou wilt long for the work of Thy hands.
18¿é 14:16 "For now Thou dost number my steps, Thou dost not observe my sin.
18¿é 14:17 "My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And Thou dost wrap up my iniquity.
18¿é 14:18 "But the falling mountain crumbles away, And the rock moves from its place;
18¿é 14:19 Water wears away stones, Its torrents wash away the dust of the earth; So Thou dost destroy man's hope.
18¿é 14:20 "Thou dost forever overpower him and he departs; [Thou] dost change his appearance and send him away.
18¿é 14:21 "His sons achieve honor, but he does not know [it;] Or they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.
18¿é 14:22 "But his body pains him, And he mourns only for himself."
18¿é 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
18¿é 15:2 "Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?
18¿é 15:3 "Should he argue with useless talk, Or with words which are not profitable?
18¿é 15:4 "Indeed, you do away with reverence, And hinder meditation before God.
18¿é 15:5 "For your guilt teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty.
18¿é 15:6 "Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; And your own lips testify against you.
18¿é 15:7 "Were you the first man to be born, Or were you brought forth before the hills?
18¿é 15:8 "Do you hear the secret counsel of God, And limit wisdom to yourself?
18¿é 15:9 "What do you know that we do not know? [What] do you understand that we do not?
18¿é 15:10 "Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Older than your father.
18¿é 15:11 "Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word [spoken] gently with you?
18¿é 15:12 "Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,
18¿é 15:13 That you should turn your spirit against God, And allow [such] words to go out of your mouth?
18¿é 15:14 "What is man, that he should be pure, Or he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
18¿é 15:15 "Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones, And the heavens are not pure in His sight;
18¿é 15:16 How much less one who is detestable and corrupt, Man, who drinks iniquity like water!
18¿é 15:17 "I will tell you, listen to me; And what I have seen I will also declare;
18¿é 15:18 What wise men have told, And have not concealed from their fathers,
18¿é 15:19 To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them.
18¿é 15:20 "The wicked man writhes in pain all [his] days, And numbered are the years stored up for the ruthless.
18¿é 15:21 "Sounds of terror are in his ears, While at peace the destroyer comes upon him.
18¿é 15:22 "He does not believe that he will return from darkness, And he is destined for the sword.
18¿é 15:23 "He wanders about for food, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is at hand.
18¿é 15:24 "Distress and anguish terrify him, They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,
18¿é 15:25 Because he has stretched out his hand against God, And conducts himself arrogantly against the Almighty.
18¿é 15:26 "He rushes headlong at Him With his massive shield.
18¿é 15:27 "For he has covered his face with his fat, And made his thighs heavy with flesh.
18¿é 15:28 "And he has lived in desolate cities, In houses no one would inhabit, Which are destined to become ruins.
18¿é 15:29 "He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure; And his grain will not bend down to the ground.
18¿é 15:30 "He will not escape from darkness; The flame will wither his shoots, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.
18¿é 15:31 "Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For emptiness will be his reward.
18¿é 15:32 "It will be accomplished before his time, And his palm branch will not be green.
18¿é 15:33 "He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine, And will cast off his flower like the olive tree.
18¿é 15:34 "For the company of the godless is barren, And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt.
18¿é 15:35 "They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, And their mind prepares deception."
18¿é 16:1 Then Job answered,
18¿é 16:2 "I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are you all.
18¿é 16:3 "Is there [no] limit to windy words? Or what plagues you that you answer?
18¿é 16:4 "I too could speak like you, If I were in your place. I could compose words against you, And shake my head at you.
18¿é 16:5 "I could strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips could lessen [your pain.]
18¿é 16:6 "If I speak, my pain is not lessened, And if I hold back, what has left me?
18¿é 16:7 "But now He has exhausted me; Thou hast laid waste all my company.
18¿é 16:8 "And Thou hast shriveled me up, It has become a witness; And my leanness rises up against me, It testifies to my face.
18¿é 16:9 "His anger has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My adversary glares at me.
18¿é 16:10 "They have gaped at me with their mouth, They have slapped me on the cheek with contempt; They have massed themselves against me.
18¿é 16:11 "God hands me over to ruffians, And tosses me into the hands of the wicked.
18¿é 16:12 "I was at ease, but He shattered me, And He has grasped me by the neck and shaken me to pieces; He has also set me up as His target.
18¿é 16:13 "His arrows surround me. Without mercy He splits my kidneys open; He pours out my gall on the ground.
18¿é 16:14 "He breaks through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a warrior.
18¿é 16:15 "I have sewed sackcloth over my skin, And thrust my horn in the dust.
18¿é 16:16 "My face is flushed from weeping, And deep darkness is on my eyelids,
18¿é 16:17 Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.
18¿é 16:18 "O earth, do not cover my blood, And let there be no [resting] place for my cry.
18¿é 16:19 "Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And my advocate is on high.
18¿é 16:20 "My friends are my scoffers; My eye weeps to God.
18¿é 16:21 "O that a man might plead with God As a man with his neighbor!
18¿é 16:22 "For when a few years are past, I shall go the way of no return.
18¿é 17:1 "My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, The grave is [ready] for me.
18¿é 17:2 "Surely mockers are with me, And my eye gazes on their provocation.
18¿é 17:3 "Lay down, now, a pledge for me with Thyself; Who is there that will be my guarantor?
18¿é 17:4 "For Thou hast kept their heart from understanding; Therefore Thou wilt not exalt [them.]
18¿é 17:5 "He who informs against friends for a share [of the spoil,] The eyes of his children also shall languish.
18¿é 17:6 "But He has made me a byword of the people, And I am one at whom men spit.
18¿é 17:7 "My eye has also grown dim because of grief, And all my members are as a shadow.
18¿é 17:8 "The upright shall be appalled at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
18¿é 17:9 "Nevertheless the righteous shall hold to his way, And he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
18¿é 17:10 "But come again all of you now, For I do not find a wise man among you.
18¿é 17:11 "My days are past, my plans are torn apart, [Even] the wishes of my heart.
18¿é 17:12 "They make night into day, [saying,] 'The light is near,' in the presence of darkness.
18¿é 17:13 "If I look for Sheol as my home, I make my bed in the darkness;
18¿é 17:14 If I call to the pit, 'You are my father'; To the worm, 'my mother and my sister';
18¿é 17:15 Where now is my hope? And who regards my hope?
18¿é 17:16 "Will it go down with me to Sheol? Shall we together go down into the dust?"
18¿é 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,
18¿é 18:2 "How long will you hunt for words? Show understanding and then we can talk.
18¿é 18:3 "Why are we regarded as beasts, As stupid in your eyes?
18¿é 18:4 "O you who tear yourself in your anger-- For your sake is the earth to be abandoned, Or the rock to be moved from its place?
18¿é 18:5 "Indeed, the light of the wicked goes out, And the flame of his fire gives no light.
18¿é 18:6 "The light in his tent is darkened, And his lamp goes out above him.
18¿é 18:7 "His vigorous stride is shortened, And his own scheme brings him down.
18¿é 18:8 "For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, And he steps on the webbing.
18¿é 18:9 "A snare seizes [him] by the heel, [And] a trap snaps shut on him.
18¿é 18:10 "A noose for him is hidden in the ground, And a trap for him on the path.
18¿é 18:11 "All around terrors frighten him, And harry him at every step.
18¿é 18:12 "His strength is famished, And calamity is ready at his side.
18¿é 18:13 "His skin is devoured by disease, The first-born of death devours his limbs.
18¿é 18:14 "He is torn from the security of his tent, And they march him before the king of terrors.
18¿é 18:15 "There dwells in his tent nothing of his; Brimstone is scattered on his habitation.
18¿é 18:16 "His roots are dried below, And his branch is cut off above.
18¿é 18:17 "Memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name abroad.
18¿é 18:18 "He is driven from light into darkness, And chased from the inhabited world.
18¿é 18:19 "He has no offspring or posterity among his people, Nor any survivor where he sojourned.
18¿é 18:20 "Those in the west are appalled at his fate, And those in the east are seized with horror.
18¿é 18:21 "Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God."
18¿é 19:1 Then Job responded,
18¿é 19:2 "How long will you torment me, And crush me with words?
18¿é 19:3 "These ten times you have insulted me, You are not ashamed to wrong me.
18¿é 19:4 "Even if I have truly erred, My error lodges with me.
18¿é 19:5 "If indeed you vaunt yourselves against me, And prove my disgrace to me,
18¿é 19:6 Know then that God has wronged me, And has closed His net around me.
18¿é 19:7 "Behold, I cry, 'Violence!' but I get no answer; I shout for help, but there is no justice.
18¿é 19:8 "He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; And He has put darkness on my paths.
18¿é 19:9 "He has stripped my honor from me, And removed the crown from my head.
18¿é 19:10 "He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; And He has uprooted my hope like a tree.
18¿é 19:11 "He has also kindled His anger against me, And considered me as His enemy.
18¿é 19:12 "His troops come together, And build up their way against me, And camp around my tent.
18¿é 19:13 "He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
18¿é 19:14 "My relatives have failed, And my intimate friends have forgotten me.
18¿é 19:15 "Those who live in my house and my maids consider me a stranger. I am a foreigner in their sight.
18¿é 19:16 "I call to my servant, but he does not answer, I have to implore him with my mouth.
18¿é 19:17 "My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am loathsome to my own brothers.
18¿é 19:18 "Even young children despise me; I rise up and they speak against me.
18¿é 19:19 "All my associates abhor me, And those I love have turned against me.
18¿é 19:20 "My bone clings to my skin and my flesh, And I have escaped [only] by the skin of my teeth.
18¿é 19:21 "Pity me, pity me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me.
18¿é 19:22 "Why do you persecute me as God [does,] And are not satisfied with my flesh?
18¿é 19:23 "Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
18¿é 19:24 "That with an iron stylus and lead They were engraved in the rock forever!
18¿é 19:25 "And as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the last He will take His stand on the earth.
18¿é 19:26 "Even after my skin is destroyed, Yet from my flesh I shall see God;
18¿é 19:27 Whom I myself shall behold, And whom my eyes shall see and not another. My heart faints within me.
18¿é 19:28 "If you say, 'How shall we persecute him?' And 'What pretext for a case against him can we find?'
18¿é 19:29 "[Then] be afraid of the sword for yourselves, For wrath [brings] the punishment of the sword, So that you may know there is judgment."
18¿é 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
18¿é 20:2 "Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation.
18¿é 20:3 "I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer.
18¿é 20:4 "Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth,
18¿é 20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary?
18¿é 20:6 "Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds,
18¿é 20:7 He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'
18¿é 20:8 "He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away.
18¿é 20:9 "The eye which saw him sees him no more, And his place no longer beholds him.
18¿é 20:10 "His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth.
18¿é 20:11 "His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust.
18¿é 20:12 "Though evil is sweet in his mouth, [And] he hides it under his tongue,
18¿é 20:13 [Though] he desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his mouth,
18¿é 20:14 [Yet] his food in his stomach is changed To the venom of cobras within him.
18¿é 20:15 "He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly.
18¿é 20:16 "He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue slays him.
18¿é 20:17 "He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds.
18¿é 20:18 "He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow [it;] As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy [them.]
18¿é 20:19 "For he has oppressed [and] forsaken the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built.
18¿é 20:20 "Because he knew no quiet within him He does not retain anything he desires.
18¿é 20:21 "Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure.
18¿é 20:22 "In the fulness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come [against] him.
18¿é 20:23 "When he fills his belly, [God] will send His fierce anger on him And will rain [it] on him while he is eating.
18¿é 20:24 "He may flee from the iron weapon, [But] the bronze bow will pierce him.
18¿é 20:25 "It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him,
18¿é 20:26 Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent.
18¿é 20:27 "The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him.
18¿é 20:28 "The increase of his house will depart; [His possessions] will flow away in the day of His anger.
18¿é 20:29 "This is the wicked man's portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God."
18¿é 21:1 Then Job answered,
18¿é 21:2 "Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your [way of] consolation.
18¿é 21:3 "Bear with me that I may speak; Then after I have spoken, you may mock.
18¿é 21:4 "As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?
18¿é 21:5 "Look at me, and be astonished, And put [your] hand over [your] mouth.
18¿é 21:6 "Even when I remember, I am disturbed, And horror takes hold of my flesh.
18¿é 21:7 "Why do the wicked [still] live, Continue on, also become very powerful?
18¿é 21:8 "Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes,
18¿é 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God on them.
18¿é 21:10 "His ox mates without fail; His cow calves and does not abort.
18¿é 21:11 "They send forth their little ones like the flock, And their children skip about.
18¿é 21:12 "They sing to the timbrel and harp And rejoice at the sound of the flute.
18¿é 21:13 "They spend their days in prosperity, And suddenly they go down to Sheol.
18¿é 21:14 "And they say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not even desire the knowledge of Thy ways.
18¿é 21:15 'Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?'
18¿é 21:16 "Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18¿é 21:17 "How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, Or [does] their calamity fall on them? Does God apportion destruction in His anger?
18¿é 21:18 "Are they as straw before the wind, And like chaff which the storm carries away?
18¿é 21:19 "[You say,] 'God stores away a man's iniquity for his sons.' Let God repay him so that he may know [it.]
18¿é 21:20 "Let his own eyes see his decay, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
18¿é 21:21 "For what does he care for his household after him, When the number of his months is cut off?
18¿é 21:22 "Can anyone teach God knowledge, In that He judges those on high?
18¿é 21:23 "One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and satisfied;
18¿é 21:24 His sides are filled out with fat, And the marrow of his bones is moist,
18¿é 21:25 While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting [anything] good.
18¿é 21:26 "Together they lie down in the dust, And worms cover them.
18¿é 21:27 "Behold, I know your thoughts, And the plans by which you would wrong me.
18¿é 21:28 "For you say, 'Where is the house of the nobleman, And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?'
18¿é 21:29 "Have you not asked wayfaring men, And do you not recognize their witness?
18¿é 21:30 "For the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity; They will be led forth at the day of fury.
18¿é 21:31 "Who will confront him with his actions, And who will repay him for what he has done?
18¿é 21:32 "While he is carried to the grave, [Men] will keep watch over [his] tomb.
18¿é 21:33 "The clods of the valley will gently cover him; Moreover, all men will follow after him, While countless ones [go] before him.
18¿é 21:34 "How then will you vainly comfort me, For your answers remain [full of] falsehood?"
18¿é 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,
18¿é 22:2 "Can a vigorous man be of use to God, Or a wise man be useful to himself?
18¿é 22:3 "Is there any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, Or profit if you make your ways perfect?
18¿é 22:4 "Is it because of your reverence that He reproves you, That He enters into judgment against you?
18¿é 22:5 "Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquities without end?
18¿é 22:6 "For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause, And stripped men naked.
18¿é 22:7 "To the weary you have given no water to drink, And from the hungry you have withheld bread.
18¿é 22:8 "But the earth belongs to the mighty man, And the honorable man dwells in it.
18¿é 22:9 "You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the orphans has been crushed.
18¿é 22:10 "Therefore snares surround you, And sudden dread terrifies you,
18¿é 22:11 Or darkness, so that you cannot see, And an abundance of water covers you.
18¿é 22:12 "Is not God [in] the height of heaven? Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!
18¿é 22:13 "And you say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?
18¿é 22:14 'Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.'
18¿é 22:15 "Will you keep to the ancient path Which wicked men have trod,
18¿é 22:16 Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundations were washed away by a river?
18¿é 22:17 "They said to God, 'Depart from us!' And 'What can the Almighty do to them?'
18¿é 22:18 "Yet He filled their houses with good [things;] But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18¿é 22:19 "The righteous see and are glad, And the innocent mock them,
18¿é 22:20 [Saying,] 'Truly our adversaries are cut off, And their abundance the fire has consumed.'
18¿é 22:21 "Yield now and be at peace with Him; Thereby good will come to you.
18¿é 22:22 "Please receive instruction from His mouth, And establish His words in your heart.
18¿é 22:23 "If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; If you remove unrighteousness far from your tent,
18¿é 22:24 And place [your] gold in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks,
18¿é 22:25 Then the Almighty will be your gold And choice silver to you.
18¿é 22:26 "For then you will delight in the Almighty, And lift up your face to God.
18¿é 22:27 "You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; And you will pay your vows.
18¿é 22:28 "You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you; And light will shine on your ways.
18¿é 22:29 "When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence And the humble person He will save.
18¿é 22:30 "He will deliver one who is not innocent, And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
18¿é 23:1 Then Job replied,
18¿é 23:2 "Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
18¿é 23:3 "Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat!
18¿é 23:4 "I would present [my] case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments.
18¿é 23:5 "I would learn the words [which] He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me.
18¿é 23:6 "Would He contend with me by the greatness of [His] power? No, surely He would pay attention to me.
18¿é 23:7 "There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
18¿é 23:8 "Behold, I go forward but He is not [there,] And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
18¿é 23:9 When He acts on the left, I cannot behold [Him;] He turns on the right, I cannot see Him.
18¿é 23:10 "But He knows the way I take; [When] He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
18¿é 23:11 "My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
18¿é 23:12 "I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.
18¿é 23:13 "But He is unique and who can turn Him? And [what] His soul desires, that He does.
18¿é 23:14 "For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such [decrees] are with Him.
18¿é 23:15 "Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; [When] I consider, I am terrified of Him.
18¿é 23:16 "[It is] God [who] has made my heart faint, And the Almighty [who] has dismayed me,
18¿é 23:17 But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom [which] covers [me.]
18¿é 24:1 "Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those who know Him not see His days?
18¿é 24:2 "Some remove the landmarks; They seize and devour flocks.
18¿é 24:3 "They drive away the donkeys of the orphans; They take the widow's ox for a pledge.
18¿é 24:4 "They push the needy aside from the road; The poor of the land are made to hide themselves altogether.
18¿é 24:5 "Behold, as wild donkeys in the wilderness They go forth seeking food in their activity, As bread for [their] children in the desert.
18¿é 24:6 "They harvest their fodder in the field, And they glean the vineyard of the wicked.
18¿é 24:7 "They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering against the cold.
18¿é 24:8 "They are wet with the mountain rains, And they hug the rock for want of a shelter.
18¿é 24:9 "Others snatch the orphan from the breast, And against the poor they take a pledge.
18¿é 24:10 "They cause [the poor] to go about naked without clothing, And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
18¿é 24:11 "Within the walls they produce oil; They tread wine presses but thirst.
18¿é 24:12 "From the city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not pay attention to folly.
18¿é 24:13 "Others have been with those who rebel against the light; They do not want to know its ways, Nor abide in its paths.
18¿é 24:14 "The murderer arises at dawn; He kills the poor and the needy, And at night he is as a thief.
18¿é 24:15 "And the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me.' And he disguises his face.
18¿é 24:16 "In the dark they dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light.
18¿é 24:17 "For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar with the terrors of thick darkness.
18¿é 24:18 "They are insignificant on the surface of the water; Their portion is cursed on the earth. They do not turn toward the vineyards.
18¿é 24:19 "Drought and heat consume the snow waters, [So does] Sheol [those who] have sinned.
18¿é 24:20 "A mother will forget him; The worm feeds sweetly till he is remembered no more. And wickedness will be broken like a tree.
18¿é 24:21 "He wrongs the barren woman, And does no good for the widow.
18¿é 24:22 "But He drags off the valiant by His power; He rises, but no one has assurance of life.
18¿é 24:23 "He provides them with security, and they are supported; And His eyes are on their ways.
18¿é 24:24 "They are exalted a little while, then they are gone; Moreover, they are brought low and like everything gathered up; Even like the heads of grain they are cut off.
18¿é 24:25 "Now if it is not so, who can prove me a liar, And make my speech worthless?"
18¿é 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
18¿é 25:2 "Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights.
18¿é 25:3 "Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise?
18¿é 25:4 "How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman?
18¿é 25:5 "If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight,
18¿é 25:6 How much less man, [that] maggot, And the son of man, [that] worm! "
18¿é 26:1 Then Job responded,
18¿é 26:2 "What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength!
18¿é 26:3 "What counsel you have given to [one] without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided!
18¿é 26:4 "To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?
18¿é 26:5 "The departed spirits tremble Under the waters and their inhabitants.
18¿é 26:6 "Naked is Sheol before Him And Abaddon has no covering.
18¿é 26:7 "He stretches out the north over empty space, And hangs the earth on nothing.
18¿é 26:8 "He wraps up the waters in His clouds; And the cloud does not burst under them.
18¿é 26:9 "He obscures the face of the full moon, And spreads His cloud over it.
18¿é 26:10 "He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters, At the boundary of light and darkness.
18¿é 26:11 "The pillars of heaven tremble, And are amazed at His rebuke.
18¿é 26:12 "He quieted the sea with His power, And by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
18¿é 26:13 "By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent.
18¿é 26:14 "Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?"
18¿é 27:1 Then Job continued his discourse and said,
18¿é 27:2 "As God lives, who has taken away my right, And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,
18¿é 27:3 For as long as life is in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils,
18¿é 27:4 My lips certainly will not speak unjustly, Nor will my tongue mutter deceit.
18¿é 27:5 "Far be it from me that I should declare you right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
18¿é 27:6 "I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go. My heart does not reproach any of my days.
18¿é 27:7 "May my enemy be as the wicked, And my opponent as the unjust.
18¿é 27:8 "For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, When God requires his life?
18¿é 27:9 "Will God hear his cry, When distress comes upon him?
18¿é 27:10 "Will he take delight in the Almighty, Will he call on God at all times?
18¿é 27:11 "I will instruct you in the power of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.
18¿é 27:12 "Behold, all of you have seen [it;] Why then do you act foolishly?
18¿é 27:13 "This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the inheritance [which] tyrants receive from the Almighty.
18¿é 27:14 "Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread.
18¿é 27:15 "His survivors will be buried because of the plague, And their widows will not be able to weep.
18¿é 27:16 "Though he piles up silver like dust, And prepares garments as [plentiful as] the clay;
18¿é 27:17 He may prepare [it,] but the just will wear [it,] And the innocent will divide the silver.
18¿é 27:18 "He has built his house like the spider's web, Or as a hut [which] the watchman has made.
18¿é 27:19 "He lies down rich, but never again; He opens his eyes, and it is no more.
18¿é 27:20 "Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night.
18¿é 27:21 "The east wind carries him away, and he is gone, For it whirls him away from his place.
18¿é 27:22 "For it will hurl at him without sparing; He will surely try to flee from its power.
18¿é 27:23 "[Men] will clap their hands at him, And will hiss him from his place.
18¿é 28:1 "Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where they refine gold.
18¿é 28:2 "Iron is taken from the dust, And from rock copper is smelted.
18¿é 28:3 "[Man] puts an end to darkness, And to the farthest limit he searches out The rock in gloom and deep shadow.
18¿é 28:4 "He sinks a shaft far from habitation, Forgotten by the foot; They hang and swing to and fro far from men.
18¿é 28:5 "The earth, from it comes food, And underneath it is turned up as fire.
18¿é 28:6 "Its rocks are the source of sapphires, And its dust [contains] gold.
18¿é 28:7 "The path no bird of prey knows, Nor has the falcon's eye caught sight of it.
18¿é 28:8 "The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor has the [fierce] lion passed over it.
18¿é 28:9 "He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the base.
18¿é 28:10 "He hews out channels through the rocks; And his eye sees anything precious.
18¿é 28:11 "He dams up the streams from flowing; And what is hidden he brings out to the light.
18¿é 28:12 "But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
18¿é 28:13 "Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living.
18¿é 28:14 "The deep says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
18¿é 28:15 "Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, Nor can silver be weighed as its price.
18¿é 28:16 "It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx, or sapphire.
18¿é 28:17 "Gold or glass cannot equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
18¿é 28:18 "Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; And the acquisition of wisdom is above [that of] pearls.
18¿é 28:19 "The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold.
18¿é 28:20 "Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
18¿é 28:21 "Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the sky.
18¿é 28:22 "Abaddon and Death say, 'With our ears we have heard a report of it.'
18¿é 28:23 "God understands its way; And He knows its place.
18¿é 28:24 "For He looks to the ends of the earth, And sees everything under the heavens.
18¿é 28:25 "When He imparted weight to the wind, And meted out the waters by measure,
18¿é 28:26 When He set a limit for the rain, And a course for the thunderbolt,
18¿é 28:27 Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and also searched it out.
18¿é 28:28 "And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'"
18¿é 29:1 And Job again took up his discourse and said,
18¿é 29:2 "Oh that I were as in months gone by, As in the days when God watched over me;
18¿é 29:3 When His lamp shone over my head, [And] by His light I walked through darkness;
18¿é 29:4 As I was in the prime of my days, When the friendship of God [was] over my tent;
18¿é 29:5 When the Almighty was yet with me, [And] my children were around me;
18¿é 29:6 When my steps were bathed in butter, And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
18¿é 29:7 "When I went out to the gate of the city, When I took my seat in the square;
18¿é 29:8 The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the old men arose [and] stood.
18¿é 29:9 "The princes stopped talking, And put [their] hands on their mouths;
18¿é 29:10 The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to their palate.
18¿é 29:11 "For when the ear heard, it called me blessed; And when the eye saw, it gave witness of me,
18¿é 29:12 Because I delivered the poor who cried for help, And the orphan who had no helper.
18¿é 29:13 "The blessing of the one ready to perish came upon me, And I made the widow's heart sing for joy.
18¿é 29:14 "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban.
18¿é 29:15 "I was eyes to the blind, And feet to the lame.
18¿é 29:16 "I was a father to the needy, And I investigated the case which I did not know.
18¿é 29:17 "And I broke the jaws of the wicked, And snatched the prey from his teeth.
18¿é 29:18 "Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.
18¿é 29:19 'My root is spread out to the waters, And dew lies all night on my branch.
18¿é 29:20 'My glory is [ever] new with me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.'
18¿é 29:21 "To me they listened and waited, And kept silent for my counsel.
18¿é 29:22 "After my words they did not speak again, And my speech dropped on them.
18¿é 29:23 "And they waited for me as for the rain, And opened their mouth as for the spring rain.
18¿é 29:24 "I smiled on them when they did not believe, And the light of my face they did not cast down.
18¿é 29:25 "I chose a way for them and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king among the troops, As one who comforted the mourners.
18¿é 30:1 "But now those younger than I mock me, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.
18¿é 30:2 "Indeed, what [good was] the strength of their hands to me? Vigor had perished from them.
18¿é 30:3 "From want and famine they are gaunt Who gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation,
18¿é 30:4 Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And whose food is the root of the broom shrub.
18¿é 30:5 "They are driven from the community; They shout against them as [against] a thief,
18¿é 30:6 So that they dwell in dreadful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
18¿é 30:7 "Among the bushes they cry out; Under the nettles they are gathered together.
18¿é 30:8 "Fools, even those without a name, They were scourged from the land.
18¿é 30:9 "And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a byword to them.
18¿é 30:10 "They abhor me [and] stand aloof from me, And they do not refrain from spitting at my face.
18¿é 30:11 "Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off the bridle before me.
18¿é 30:12 "On the right hand their brood arises; They thrust aside my feet and build up against me their ways of destruction.
18¿é 30:13 "They break up my path, They profit from my destruction, No one restrains them.
18¿é 30:14 "As [through] a wide breach they come, Amid the tempest they roll on.
18¿é 30:15 "Terrors are turned against me, They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
18¿é 30:16 "And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have seized me.
18¿é 30:17 "At night it pierces my bones within me, And my gnawing [pains] take no rest.
18¿é 30:18 "By a great force my garment is distorted; It binds me about as the collar of my coat.
18¿é 30:19 "He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes.
18¿é 30:20 "I cry out to Thee for help, but Thou dost not answer me; I stand up, and Thou dost turn Thy attention against me.
18¿é 30:21 "Thou hast become cruel to me; With the might of Thy hand Thou dost persecute me.
18¿é 30:22 "Thou dost lift me up to the wind [and] cause me to ride; And Thou dost dissolve me in a storm.
18¿é 30:23 "For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death And to the house of meeting for all living.
18¿é 30:24 "Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out [his] hand, Or in his disaster therefore cry out for help?
18¿é 30:25 "Have I not wept for the one whose life is hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
18¿é 30:26 "When I expected good, then evil came; When I waited for light, then darkness came.
18¿é 30:27 "I am seething within, and cannot relax; Days of affliction confront me.
18¿é 30:28 "I go about mourning without comfort; I stand up in the assembly [ and] cry out for help.
18¿é 30:29 "I have become a brother to jackals, And a companion of ostriches.
18¿é 30:30 "My skin turns black on me, And my bones burn with fever.
18¿é 30:31 "Therefore my harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the sound of those who weep.
18¿é 31:1 "I Have made a covenant with my eyes; How then could I gaze at a virgin?
18¿é 31:2 "And what is the portion of God from above Or the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
18¿é 31:3 "Is it not calamity to the unjust, And disaster to those who work iniquity?
18¿é 31:4 "Does He not see my ways, And number all my steps?
18¿é 31:5 "If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot has hastened after deceit,
18¿é 31:6 Let Him weigh me with accurate scales, And let God know my integrity.
18¿é 31:7 "If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart followed my eyes, Or if any spot has stuck to my hands,
18¿é 31:8 Let me sow and another eat, And let my crops be uprooted.
18¿é 31:9 "If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or I have lurked at my neighbor's doorway,
18¿é 31:10 May my wife grind for another, And let others kneel down over her.
18¿é 31:11 "For that would be a lustful crime; Moreover, it would be an iniquity [punishable by] judges.
18¿é 31:12 "For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon, And would uproot all my increase.
18¿é 31:13 "If I have despised the claim of my male or female slaves When they filed a complaint against me,
18¿é 31:14 What then could I do when God arises, And when He calls me to account, what will I answer Him?
18¿é 31:15 "Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb?
18¿é 31:16 "If I have kept the poor from [their] desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
18¿é 31:17 Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the orphan has not shared it
18¿é 31:18 (But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from infancy I guided her),
18¿é 31:19 If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering,
18¿é 31:20 If his loins have not thanked me, And if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,
18¿é 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan, Because I saw I had support in the gate,
18¿é 31:22 Let my shoulder fall from the socket, And my arm be broken off at the elbow.
18¿é 31:23 "For calamity from God is a terror to me, And because of His majesty I can do nothing.
18¿é 31:24 "If I have put my confidence [in] gold, And called fine gold my trust,
18¿é 31:25 If I have gloated because my wealth was great, And because my hand had secured [so] much;
18¿é 31:26 If I have looked at the sun when it shone, Or the moon going in splendor,
18¿é 31:27 And my heart became secretly enticed, And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
18¿é 31:28 That too would have been an iniquity [calling for] judgment, For I would have denied God above.
18¿é 31:29 "Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy, Or exulted when evil befell him?
18¿é 31:30 "No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life in a curse.
18¿é 31:31 "Have the men of my tent not said, 'Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat'?
18¿é 31:32 "The alien has not lodged outside, [For] I have opened my doors to the traveler.
18¿é 31:33 "Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
18¿é 31:34 Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, And kept silent and did not go out of doors?
18¿é 31:35 "Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold, here is my signature; Let the Almighty answer me! And the indictment which my adversary has written,
18¿é 31:36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it to myself like a crown.
18¿é 31:37 "I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him.
18¿é 31:38 "If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together;
18¿é 31:39 If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,
18¿é 31:40 Let briars grow instead of wheat, And stinkweed instead of barley. " The words of Job are ended.
18¿é 32:1 Then these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18¿é 32:2 But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram burned; against Job his anger burned, because he justified himself before God.
18¿é 32:3 And his anger burned against his three friends because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
18¿é 32:4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.
18¿é 32:5 And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men his anger burned.
18¿é 32:6 So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said, "I am young in years and you are old; Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.
18¿é 32:7 "I thought age should speak, And increased years should teach wisdom.
18¿é 32:8 "But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.
18¿é 32:9 "The abundant [in years] may not be wise, Nor may elders understand justice.
18¿é 32:10 "So I say, 'Listen to me, I too will tell what I think.'
18¿é 32:11 "Behold, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, While you pondered what to say.
18¿é 32:12 "I even paid close attention to you, Indeed, there was no one who refuted Job, Not one of you who answered his words.
18¿é 32:13 "Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; God will rout him, not man.'
18¿é 32:14 "For he has not arranged [his] words against me; Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.
18¿é 32:15 "They are dismayed, they answer no more; Words have failed them.
18¿é 32:16 "And shall I wait, because they do not speak, Because they stop [and] answer no more?
18¿é 32:17 "I too will answer my share, I also will tell my opinion.
18¿é 32:18 "For I am full of words; The spirit within me constrains me.
18¿é 32:19 "Behold, my belly is like unvented wine, Like new wineskins it is about to burst.
18¿é 32:20 "Let me speak that I may get relief; Let me open my lips and answer.
18¿é 32:21 "Let me now be partial to no one; Nor flatter [any] man.
18¿é 32:22 "For I do not know how to flatter, [Else] my Maker would soon take me away.
18¿é 33:1 "However now, Job, please hear my speech, And listen to all my words.
18¿é 33:2 "Behold now, I open my mouth, My tongue in my mouth speaks.
18¿é 33:3 "My words are [from] the uprightness of my heart; And my lips speak knowledge sincerely.
18¿é 33:4 "The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18¿é 33:5 "Refute me if you can; Array yourselves before me, take your stand.
18¿é 33:6 "Behold, I belong to God like you; I too have been formed out of the clay.
18¿é 33:7 "Behold, no fear of me should terrify you, Nor should my pressure weigh heavily on you.
18¿é 33:8 "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of [your] words£º
18¿é 33:9 'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.
18¿é 33:10 'Behold, He invents pretexts against me; He counts me as His enemy.
18¿é 33:11 'He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches all my paths.'
18¿é 33:12 "Behold, let me tell you, you are not right in this, For God is greater than man.
18¿é 33:13 "Why do you complain against Him, That He does not give an account of all His doings?
18¿é 33:14 "Indeed God speaks once, Or twice, [yet] no one notices it.
18¿é 33:15 "In a dream, a vision of the night, When sound sleep falls on men, While they slumber in their beds,
18¿é 33:16 Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction,
18¿é 33:17 That He may turn man aside [from his] conduct, And keep man from pride;
18¿é 33:18 He keeps back his soul from the pit, And his life from passing over into Sheol.
18¿é 33:19 "Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with unceasing complaint in his bones;
18¿é 33:20 So that his life loathes bread, And his soul favorite food.
18¿é 33:21 "His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones which were not seen stick out.
18¿é 33:22 "Then his soul draws near to the pit, And his life to those who bring death.
18¿é 33:23 "If there is an angel [as] mediator for him, One out of a thousand, To remind a man what is right for him,
18¿é 33:24 Then let him be gracious to him, and say, 'Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom';
18¿é 33:25 Let his flesh become fresher than in youth, Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor;
18¿é 33:26 Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, That he may see His face with joy, And He may restore His righteousness to man.
18¿é 33:27 "He will sing to men and say, 'I have sinned and perverted what is right, And it is not proper for me.
18¿é 33:28 'He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit, And my life shall see the light.'
18¿é 33:29 "Behold, God does all these oftentimes with men,
18¿é 33:30 To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life.
18¿é 33:31 "Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; Keep silent and let me speak.
18¿é 33:32 "[Then] if you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you.
18¿é 33:33 "If not, listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
18¿é 34:1 Then Elihu continued and said,
18¿é 34:2 "Hear my words, you wise men, And listen to me, you who know.
18¿é 34:3 "For the ear tests words, As the palate tastes food.
18¿é 34:4 "Let us choose for ourselves what is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.
18¿é 34:5 "For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my right;
18¿é 34:6 Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, [though I am] without transgression. '
18¿é 34:7 "What man is like Job, Who drinks up derision like water,
18¿é 34:8 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?
18¿é 34:9 "For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing When he is pleased with God.'
18¿é 34:10 "Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to do wrong.
18¿é 34:11 "For He pays a man according to his work, And makes him find it according to his way.
18¿é 34:12 "Surely, God will not act wickedly, And the Almighty will not pervert justice.
18¿é 34:13 "Who gave Him authority over the earth? And who has laid [on Him] the whole world?
18¿é 34:14 "If He should determine to do so, If He should gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,
18¿é 34:15 All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust.
18¿é 34:16 "But if [you have] understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words.
18¿é 34:17 "Shall one who hates justice rule? And will you condemn a righteous mighty one,
18¿é 34:18 Who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' To nobles, 'Wicked ones';
18¿é 34:19 Who shows no partiality to princes, Nor regards the rich above the poor, For they all are the work of His hands?
18¿é 34:20 "In a moment they die, and at midnight People are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a hand.
18¿é 34:21 "For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps.
18¿é 34:22 "There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
18¿é 34:23 "For He does not [need to] consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment.
18¿é 34:24 "He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place.
18¿é 34:25 "Therefore He knows their works, And He overthrows [them] in the night, And they are crushed.
18¿é 34:26 "He strikes them like the wicked In a public place,
18¿é 34:27 Because they turned aside from following Him, And had no regard for any of His ways;
18¿é 34:28 So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, And that He might hear the cry of the afflicted--
18¿é 34:29 When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him, That is, in regard to both nation and man?--
18¿é 34:30 So that godless men should not rule, Nor be snares of the people.
18¿é 34:31 "For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne [chastisement;] I will not offend [anymore;]
18¿é 34:32 Teach Thou me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more '?
18¿é 34:33 "Shall He recompense on your terms, because you have rejected [it?] For you must choose, and not I; Therefore declare what you know.
18¿é 34:34 "Men of understanding will say to me, And a wise man who hears me,
18¿é 34:35 'Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.
18¿é 34:36 'Job ought to be tried to the limit, Because he answers like wicked men.
18¿é 34:37 'For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.' "
18¿é 35:1 Then Elihu continued and said,
18¿é 35:2 "Do you think this is according to justice? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'?
18¿é 35:3 "For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?'
18¿é 35:4 "I will answer you, And your friends with you.
18¿é 35:5 "Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds-- they are higher than you.
18¿é 35:6 "If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him? And if your transgressions are many, what do you do to Him?
18¿é 35:7 "If you are righteous, what do you give to Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
18¿é 35:8 "Your wickedness is for a man like yourself, And your righteousness is for a son of man.
18¿é 35:9 "Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
18¿é 35:10 "But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night,
18¿é 35:11 Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens? '
18¿é 35:12 "There they cry out, but He does not answer Because of the pride of evil men.
18¿é 35:13 "Surely God will not listen to an empty [cry,] Nor will the Almighty regard it.
18¿é 35:14 "How much less when you say you do not behold Him, The case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!
18¿é 35:15 "And now, because He has not visited [in] His anger, Nor has He acknowledged transgression well,
18¿é 35:16 So Job opens his mouth emptily; He multiplies words without knowledge. "
18¿é 36:1 Then Elihu continued and said,
18¿é 36:2 "Wait for me a little, and I will show you That there is yet more to be said in God's behalf.
18¿é 36:3 "I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
18¿é 36:4 "For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
18¿é 36:5 "Behold, God is mighty but does not despise [any;] [He is] mighty in strength of understanding.
18¿é 36:6 "He does not keep the wicked alive, But gives justice to the afflicted.
18¿é 36:7 "He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But with kings on the throne He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.
18¿é 36:8 "And if they are bound in fetters, And are caught in the cords of affliction,
18¿é 36:9 Then He declares to them their work And their transgressions, that they have magnified themselves.
18¿é 36:10 "And He opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they return from evil.
18¿é 36:11 "If they hear and serve [Him,] They shall end their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.
18¿é 36:12 "But if they do not hear, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.
18¿é 36:13 "But the godless in heart lay up anger; They do not cry for help when He binds them.
18¿é 36:14 "They die in youth, And their life [perishes] among the cult prostitutes.
18¿é 36:15 "He delivers the afflicted in their affliction, And opens their ear in [time of] oppression.
18¿é 36:16 "Then indeed, He enticed you from the mouth of distress, Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint; And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.
18¿é 36:17 "But you were full of judgment on the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold [of you.]
18¿é 36:18 "[Beware] lest wrath entice you to scoffing; And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.
18¿é 36:19 "Will your riches keep [you] from distress, Or all the forces of [ your] strength?
18¿é 36:20 "Do not long for the night, When people vanish in their place.
18¿é 36:21 "Be careful, do not turn to evil; For you have preferred this to affliction.
18¿é 36:22 "Behold, God is exalted in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?
18¿é 36:23 "Who has appointed Him His way, And who has said, 'Thou hast done wrong'?
18¿é 36:24 "Remember that you should exalt His work, Of which men have sung.
18¿é 36:25 "All men have seen it; Man beholds from afar.
18¿é 36:26 "Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know [Him;] The number of His years is unsearchable.
18¿é 36:27 "For He draws up the drops of water, They distill rain from the mist,
18¿é 36:28 Which the clouds pour down, They drip upon man abundantly.
18¿é 36:29 "Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, The thundering of His pavilion?
18¿é 36:30 "Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him, And He covers the depths of the sea.
18¿é 36:31 "For by these He judges peoples; He gives food in abundance.
18¿é 36:32 "He covers [His] hands with the lightning, And commands it to strike the mark.
18¿é 36:33 "Its noise declares His presence; The cattle also, concerning what is coming up.
18¿é 37:1 "At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place.
18¿é 37:2 "Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that goes out from His mouth.
18¿é 37:3 "Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, And His lightning to the ends of the earth.
18¿é 37:4 "After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice; And He does not restrain the lightnings when His voice is heard.
18¿é 37:5 "God thunders with His voice wondrously, Doing great things which we cannot comprehend.
18¿é 37:6 "For to the snow He says, 'Fall on the earth,' And to the downpour and the rain, 'Be strong.'
18¿é 37:7 "He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work.
18¿é 37:8 "Then the beast goes into its lair, And remains in its den.
18¿é 37:9 "Out of the south comes the storm, And out of the north the cold.
18¿é 37:10 "From the breath of God ice is made, And the expanse of the waters is frozen.
18¿é 37:11 "Also with moisture He loads the thick cloud; He disperses the cloud of His lightning.
18¿é 37:12 "And it changes direction, turning around by His guidance, That it may do whatever He commands it On the face of the inhabited earth.
18¿é 37:13 "Whether for correction, or for His world, Or for lovingkindness, He causes it to happen.
18¿é 37:14 "Listen to this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.
18¿é 37:15 "Do you know how God establishes them, And makes the lightning of His cloud to shine?
18¿é 37:16 "Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds, The wonders of one perfect in knowledge,
18¿é 37:17 You whose garments are hot, When the land is still because of the south wind?
18¿é 37:18 "Can you, with Him, spread out the skies, Strong as a molten mirror?
18¿é 37:19 "Teach us what we shall say to Him; We cannot arrange [our case] because of darkness.
18¿é 37:20 "Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man say that he would be swallowed up?
18¿é 37:21 "And now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind has passed and cleared them.
18¿é 37:22 "Out of the north comes golden [splendor;] Around God is awesome majesty.
18¿é 37:23 "The Almighty-- we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power; And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.
18¿é 37:24 "Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard any who are wise of heart."
18¿é 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,
18¿é 38:2 "Who is this that darkens counsel By words without knowledge?
18¿é 38:3 "Now gird up your loins like a man, And I will ask you, and you instruct Me!
18¿é 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell [Me,] if you have understanding,
18¿é 38:5 Who set its measurements, since you know? Or who stretched the line on it?
18¿é 38:6 "On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone,
18¿é 38:7 When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
18¿é 38:8 "Or [who] enclosed the sea with doors, When, bursting forth, it went out from the womb;
18¿é 38:9 When I made a cloud its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band,
18¿é 38:10 And I placed boundaries on it, And I set a bolt and doors,
18¿é 38:11 And I said, 'Thus far you shall come, but no farther; And here shall your proud waves stop'?
18¿é 38:12 "Have you ever in your life commanded the morning, [And] caused the dawn to know its place;
18¿é 38:13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?
18¿é 38:14 "It is changed like clay [under] the seal; And they stand forth like a garment.
18¿é 38:15 "And from the wicked their light is withheld, And the uplifted arm is broken.
18¿é 38:16 "Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
18¿é 38:17 "Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
18¿é 38:18 "Have you understood the expanse of the earth? Tell [Me,] if you know all this.
18¿é 38:19 "Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place,
18¿é 38:20 That you may take it to its territory, And that you may discern the paths to its home?
18¿é 38:21 "You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great!
18¿é 38:22 "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, Or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
18¿é 38:23 Which I have reserved for the time of distress, For the day of war and battle?
18¿é 38:24 "Where is the way that the light is divided, [Or] the east wind scattered on the earth?
18¿é 38:25 "Who has cleft a channel for the flood, Or a way for the thunderbolt;
18¿é 38:26 To bring rain on a land without people, [On] a desert without a man in it,
18¿é 38:27 To satisfy the waste and desolate land, And to make the seeds of grass to sprout?
18¿é 38:28 "Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
18¿é 38:29 "From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?
18¿é 38:30 "Water becomes hard like stone, And the surface of the deep is imprisoned.
18¿é 38:31 "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the cords of Orion?
18¿é 38:32 "Can you lead forth a constellation in its season, And guide the Bear with her satellites?
18¿é 38:33 "Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, Or fix their rule over the earth?
18¿é 38:34 "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, So that an abundance of water may cover you?
18¿é 38:35 "Can you send forth lightnings that they may go And say to you, 'Here we are'?
18¿é 38:36 "Who has put wisdom in the innermost being, Or has given understanding to the mind?
18¿é 38:37 "Who can count the clouds by wisdom, Or tip the water jars of the heavens,
18¿é 38:38 When the dust hardens into a mass, And the clods stick together?
18¿é 38:39 "Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
18¿é 38:40 When they crouch in [their] dens, [And] lie in wait in [their] lair?
18¿é 38:41 "Who prepares for the raven its nourishment, When its young cry to God, And wander about without food?
18¿é 39:1 "Do you know the time the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the deer?
18¿é 39:2 "Can you count the months they fulfill, Or do you know the time they give birth?
18¿é 39:3 "They kneel down, they bring forth their young, They get rid of their labor pains.
18¿é 39:4 "Their offspring become strong, they grow up in the open field; They leave and do not return to them.
18¿é 39:5 "Who sent out the wild donkey free? And who loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
18¿é 39:6 To whom I gave the wilderness for a home, And the salt land for his dwelling place?
18¿é 39:7 "He scorns the tumult of the city, The shoutings of the driver he does not hear.
18¿é 39:8 "He explores the mountains for his pasture, And he searches after every green thing.
18¿é 39:9 "Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Or will he spend the night at your manger?
18¿é 39:10 "Can you bind the wild ox in a furrow with ropes? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?
18¿é 39:11 "Will you trust him because his strength is great And leave your labor to him?
18¿é 39:12 "Will you have faith in him that he will return your grain, And gather [it from] your threshing floor?
18¿é 39:13 "The ostriches' wings flap joyously With the pinion and plumage of love,
18¿é 39:14 For she abandons her eggs to the earth, And warms them in the dust,
18¿é 39:15 And she forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may trample them.
18¿é 39:16 "She treats her young cruelly, as if [they] were not hers; Though her labor be in vain, [she] is unconcerned;
18¿é 39:17 Because God has made her forget wisdom, And has not given her a share of understanding.
18¿é 39:18 "When she lifts herself on high, She laughs at the horse and his rider.
18¿é 39:19 "Do you give the horse [his] might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane?
18¿é 39:20 "Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrible.
18¿é 39:21 "He paws in the valley, and rejoices in [his] strength; He goes out to meet the weapons.
18¿é 39:22 "He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; And he does not turn back from the sword.
18¿é 39:23 "The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and javelin.
18¿é 39:24 "With shaking and rage he races over the ground; And he does not stand still at the voice of the trumpet.
18¿é 39:25 "As often as the trumpet [sounds] he says, 'Aha!' And he scents the battle from afar, And thunder of the captains, and the war cry.
18¿é 39:26 "Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, Stretching his wings toward the south?
18¿é 39:27 "Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, And makes his nest on high?
18¿é 39:28 "On the cliff he dwells and lodges, Upon the rocky crag, an inaccessible place.
18¿é 39:29 "From there he spies out food; His eyes see [it] from afar.
18¿é 39:30 "His young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is he."
18¿é 40:1 Then the LORD said to Job,
18¿é 40:2 "Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who reproves God answer it."
18¿é 40:3 Then Job answered the LORD and said,
18¿é 40:4 "Behold, I am insignificant; what can I reply to Thee? I lay my hand on my mouth.
18¿é 40:5 "Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; Even twice, and I will add no more."
18¿é 40:6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm, and said,
18¿é 40:7 "Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me.
18¿é 40:8 "Will you really annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me that you may be justified?
18¿é 40:9 "Or do you have an arm like God, And can you thunder with a voice like His?
18¿é 40:10 "Adorn yourself with eminence and dignity; And clothe yourself with honor and majesty.
18¿é 40:11 "Pour out the overflowings of your anger; And look on everyone who is proud, and make him low.
18¿é 40:12 "Look on everyone who is proud, [and] humble him; And tread down the wicked where they stand.
18¿é 40:13 "Hide them in the dust together; Bind them in the hidden [place.]
18¿é 40:14 "Then I will also confess to you, That your own right hand can save you.
18¿é 40:15 "Behold now, Behemoth, which I made as well as you; He eats grass like an ox.
18¿é 40:16 "Behold now, his strength in his loins, And his power in the muscles of his belly.
18¿é 40:17 "He bends his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
18¿é 40:18 "His bones are tubes of bronze; His limbs are like bars of iron.
18¿é 40:19 "He is the first of the ways of God; Let his maker bring near his sword.
18¿é 40:20 "Surely the mountains bring him food, And all the beasts of the field play there.
18¿é 40:21 "Under the lotus plants he lies down, In the covert of the reeds and the marsh.
18¿é 40:22 "The lotus plants cover him with shade; The willows of the brook surround him.
18¿é 40:23 "If a river rages, he is not alarmed; He is confident, though the Jordan rushes to his mouth.
18¿é 40:24 "Can anyone capture him when he is on watch, With barbs can anyone pierce [his] nose?
18¿é 41:1 "Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?
18¿é 41:2 "Can you put a rope in his nose? Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
18¿é 41:3 "Will he make many supplications to you? Or will he speak to you soft words?
18¿é 41:4 "Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him for a servant forever?
18¿é 41:5 "Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your maidens?
18¿é 41:6 "Will the traders bargain over him? Will they divide him among the merchants?
18¿é 41:7 "Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears?
18¿é 41:8 "Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle; you will not do it again!
18¿é 41:9 "Behold, your expectation is false; Will you be laid low even at the sight of him?
18¿é 41:10 "No one is so fierce that he dares to arouse him; Who then is he that can stand before Me?
18¿é 41:11 "Who has given to Me that I should repay [him?] [Whatever] is under the whole heaven is Mine.
18¿é 41:12 "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Or his mighty strength, or his orderly frame.
18¿é 41:13 "Who can strip off his outer armor? Who can come within his double mail?
18¿é 41:14 "Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth there is terror.
18¿é 41:15 "[His] strong scales are [his] pride, Shut up [as with] a tight seal.
18¿é 41:16 "One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.
18¿é 41:17 "They are joined one to another; They clasp each other and cannot be separated.
18¿é 41:18 "His sneezes flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
18¿é 41:19 "Out of his mouth go burning torches; Sparks of fire leap forth.
18¿é 41:20 "Out of his nostrils smoke goes forth, As [from] a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.
18¿é 41:21 "His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes forth from his mouth.
18¿é 41:22 "In his neck lodges strength, And dismay leaps before him.
18¿é 41:23 "The folds of his flesh are joined together, Firm on him and immovable.
18¿é 41:24 "His heart is as hard as a stone; Even as hard as a lower millstone.
18¿é 41:25 "When he raises himself up, the mighty fear; Because of the crashing they are bewildered.
18¿é 41:26 "The sword that reaches him cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
18¿é 41:27 "He regards iron as straw, Bronze as rotten wood.
18¿é 41:28 "The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned into stubble for him.
18¿é 41:29 "Clubs are regarded as stubble; He laughs at the rattling of the javelin.
18¿é 41:30 "His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds; He spreads out [like] a threshing sledge on the mire.
18¿é 41:31 "He makes the depths boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
18¿é 41:32 "Behind him he makes a wake to shine; One would think the deep to be gray-haired.
18¿é 41:33 "Nothing on earth is like him, One made without fear.
18¿é 41:34 "He looks on everything that is high; He is king over all the sons of pride."
18¿é 42:1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
18¿é 42:2 "I know that Thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of Thine can be thwarted.
18¿é 42:3 'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' "Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know."
18¿é 42:4 'Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask Thee, and do Thou instruct me.'
18¿é 42:5 "I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees Thee;
18¿é 42:6 Therefore I retract, And I repent in dust and ashes. "
18¿é 42:7 And it came about after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, that the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken of Me what is right as My servant Job has.
18¿é 42:8 "Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so that I may not do with you [according to your] folly, because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has."
18¿é 42:9 "So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite [and] Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job.
18¿é 42:10 And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased all that Job had twofold.
18¿é 42:11 Then all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all who had known him before, came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him one piece of money, and each a ring of gold.
18¿é 42:12 And the LORD blessed the latter [days] of Job more than his beginning, and he had 140000 sheep, and 60000 camels, and 10000 yoke of oxen, and 10000 female donkeys.
18¿é 42:13 And he had seven sons and three daughters.
18¿é 42:14 And he named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.
18¿é 42:15 And in all the land no women were found so fair as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.
18¿é 42:16 And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his grandsons, four generations.
18¿é 42:17 And Job died, an old man and full of days.

19½Ã 1:1 How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
19½Ã 1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.
19½Ã 1:3 And he will be like a tree [firmly] planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season, And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.
19½Ã 1:4 The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
19½Ã 1:5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
19½Ã 1:6 For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish.
19½Ã 2:1 Why are the nations in an uproar, And the peoples devising a vain thing?
19½Ã 2:2 The kings of the earth take their stand, And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and against His Anointed£º
19½Ã 2:3 "Let us tear their fetters apart, And cast away their cords from us!"
19½Ã 2:4 He who sits in the heavens laughs, The Lord scoffs at them.
19½Ã 2:5 Then He will speak to them in His anger And terrify them in His fury£º
19½Ã 2:6 "But as for Me, I have installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain."
19½Ã 2:7 "I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD£º He said to Me, 'Thou art My Son, Today I have begotten Thee.
19½Ã 2:8 'Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Thine inheritance, And the [very] ends of the earth as Thy possession.
19½Ã 2:9 'Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, Thou shalt shatter them like earthenware.' "
19½Ã 2:10 Now therefore, O kings, show discernment; Take warning, O judges of the earth.
19½Ã 2:11 Worship the LORD with reverence, And rejoice with trembling.
19½Ã 2:12 Do homage to the Son, lest He become angry, and you perish [in] the way, For His wrath may soon be kindled. How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!
19½Ã 3:1 {A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.} O LORD, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me.
19½Ã 3:2 Many are saying of my soul, "There is no deliverance for him in God." Selah.
19½Ã 3:3 But Thou, O LORD, art a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.
19½Ã 3:4 I was crying to the LORD with my voice, And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.
19½Ã 3:5 I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me.
19½Ã 3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me round about.
19½Ã 3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For Thou hast smitten all my enemies on the cheek; Thou hast shattered the teeth of the wicked.
19½Ã 3:8 Salvation belongs to the LORD; Thy blessing [be] upon Thy people! Selah.
19½Ã 4:1 {For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.} Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! Thou hast relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
19½Ã 4:2 O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? [How long] will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.
19½Ã 4:3 But know that the LORD has set apart the godly man for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him.
19½Ã 4:4 Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
19½Ã 4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 4:6 Many are saying, "Who will show us [any] good?" Lift up the light of Thy countenance upon us, O LORD!
19½Ã 4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound.
19½Ã 4:8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For Thou alone, O LORD, dost make me to dwell in safety.
19½Ã 5:1 {For the choir director; for flute accompaniment. A Psalm of David.} Give ear to my words, O LORD, Consider my groaning.
19½Ã 5:2 Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to Thee do I pray.
19½Ã 5:3 In the morning, O LORD, Thou wilt hear my voice; In the morning I will order [my prayer] to Thee and [eagerly] watch.
19½Ã 5:4 For Thou art not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with Thee.
19½Ã 5:5 The boastful shall not stand before Thine eyes; Thou dost hate all who do iniquity.
19½Ã 5:6 Thou dost destroy those who speak falsehood; The LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
19½Ã 5:7 But as for me, by Thine abundant lovingkindness I will enter Thy house, At Thy holy temple I will bow in reverence for Thee.
19½Ã 5:8 O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of my foes; Make Thy way straight before me.
19½Ã 5:9 There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction [itself]; Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.
19½Ã 5:10 Hold them guilty, O God; By their own devices let them fall! In the multitude of their transgressions thrust them out, For they are rebellious against Thee.
19½Ã 5:11 But let all who take refuge in Thee be glad, Let them ever sing for joy; And mayest Thou shelter them, That those who love Thy name may exult in Thee.
19½Ã 5:12 For it is Thou who dost bless the righteous man, O LORD, Thou dost surround him with favor as with a shield.
19½Ã 6:1 {For the choir director; with stringed instruments, upon an eight-stringed lyre.} (A Psalm of David.) O LORD, do not rebuke me in Thine anger, Nor chasten me in Thy wrath.
19½Ã 6:2 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I [am] pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed.
19½Ã 6:3 And my soul is greatly dismayed; But Thou, O LORD-- how long?
19½Ã 6:4 Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Thy lovingkindness.
19½Ã 6:5 For there is no mention of Thee in death; In Sheol who will give Thee thanks?
19½Ã 6:6 I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears.
19½Ã 6:7 My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries.
19½Ã 6:8 Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
19½Ã 6:9 The LORD has heard my supplication, The LORD receives my prayer.
19½Ã 6:10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they shall suddenly be ashamed.
19½Ã 7:1 {A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjamite.} O LORD my God, in Thee I have taken refuge; Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
19½Ã 7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, Dragging me away, while there is none to deliver.
19½Ã 7:3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, If there is injustice in my hands,
19½Ã 7:4 If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or have plundered him who without cause was my adversary,
19½Ã 7:5 Let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake [it]; And let him trample my life down to the ground, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
19½Ã 7:6 Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger; Lift up Thyself against the rage of my adversaries, And arouse Thyself for me; Thou hast appointed judgment.
19½Ã 7:7 And let the assembly of the peoples encompass Thee; And over them return Thou on high.
19½Ã 7:8 The LORD judges the peoples; Vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and my integrity that is in me.
19½Ã 7:9 O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.
19½Ã 7:10 My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.
19½Ã 7:11 God is a righteous judge, And a God who has indignation every day.
19½Ã 7:12 If a man does not repent, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.
19½Ã 7:13 He has also prepared for Himself deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts.
19½Ã 7:14 Behold, he travails with wickedness, And he conceives mischief, and brings forth falsehood.
19½Ã 7:15 He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, And has fallen into the hole which he made.
19½Ã 7:16 His mischief will return upon his own head, And his violence will descend upon his own pate.
19½Ã 7:17 I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
19½Ã 8:1 {For the choir director; on the Gittith. A Psalm of David.} O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth, Who hast displayed Thy splendor above the heavens!
19½Ã 8:2 From the mouth of infants and nursing babes Thou hast established strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To make the enemy and the revengeful cease.
19½Ã 8:3 When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained;
19½Ã 8:4 What is man, that Thou dost take thought of him? And the son of man, that Thou dost care for him?
19½Ã 8:5 Yet Thou hast made him a little lower than God, And dost crown him with glory and majesty!
19½Ã 8:6 Thou dost make him to rule over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet,
19½Ã 8:7 All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,
19½Ã 8:8 The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
19½Ã 8:9 O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Thy name in all the earth!
19½Ã 9:1 {For the choir director; on Muth-labben. A Psalm of David.} I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will tell of all Thy wonders.
19½Ã 9:2 I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High.
19½Ã 9:3 When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before Thee.
19½Ã 9:4 For Thou hast maintained my just cause; Thou dost sit on the throne judging righteously.
19½Ã 9:5 Thou hast rebuked the nations; Thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name forever and ever.
19½Ã 9:6 The enemy has come to an end in perpetual ruins, And Thou hast uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished.
19½Ã 9:7 But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment,
19½Ã 9:8 And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples with equity.
19½Ã 9:9 The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble,
19½Ã 9:10 And those who know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; For Thou, O LORD, hast not forsaken those who seek Thee.
19½Ã 9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; Declare among the peoples His deeds.
19½Ã 9:12 For He who requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
19½Ã 9:13 Be gracious to me, O LORD; Behold my affliction from those who hate me, Thou who dost lift me up from the gates of death;
19½Ã 9:14 That I may tell of all Thy praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Thy salvation.
19½Ã 9:15 The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.
19½Ã 9:16 The LORD has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah.
19½Ã 9:17 The wicked will return to Sheol, [Even] all the nations who forget God.
19½Ã 9:18 For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
19½Ã 9:19 Arise, O LORD, do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before Thee.
19½Ã 9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD; Let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.
19½Ã 10:1 Why dost Thou stand afar off, O LORD? Why dost Thou hide [Thyself] in times of trouble?
19½Ã 10:2 In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
19½Ã 10:3 For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire, And the greedy man curses [and] spurns the LORD.
19½Ã 10:4 The wicked, in the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek [Him.] All his thoughts are, "There is no God."
19½Ã 10:5 His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are on high, out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.
19½Ã 10:6 He says to himself, "I shall not be moved; Throughout all generations I shall not be in adversity."
19½Ã 10:7 His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.
19½Ã 10:8 He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the hiding places he kills the innocent; His eyes stealthily watch for the unfortunate.
19½Ã 10:9 He lurks in a hiding place as a lion in his lair; He lurks to catch the afflicted; He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.
19½Ã 10:10 He crouches, he bows down, And the unfortunate fall by his mighty ones.
19½Ã 10:11 He says to himself, "God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it."
19½Ã 10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy hand. Do not forget the afflicted.
19½Ã 10:13 Why has the wicked spurned God? He has said to himself, "Thou wilt not require [it]."
19½Ã 10:14 Thou hast seen [it], for Thou hast beheld mischief and vexation to take it into Thy hand. The unfortunate commits [himself] to Thee; Thou hast been the helper of the orphan.
19½Ã 10:15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer, Seek out his wickedness until Thou dost find none.
19½Ã 10:16 The LORD is King forever and ever; Nations have perished from His land.
19½Ã 10:17 O LORD, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble; Thou wilt strengthen their heart, Thou wilt incline Thine ear
19½Ã 10:18 To vindicate the orphan and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may cause terror no more.
19½Ã 11:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David.} In the LORD I take refuge; How can you say to my soul, "Flee [as] a bird to your mountain;
19½Ã 11:2 For, behold, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
19½Ã 11:3 If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do? "
19½Ã 11:4 The LORD is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men.
19½Ã 11:5 The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked, And the one who loves violence His soul hates.
19½Ã 11:6 Upon the wicked He will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup.
19½Ã 11:7 For the LORD is righteous; He loves righteousness; The upright will behold His face.
19½Ã 12:1 {For the choir director; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.} Help, LORD, for the godly man ceases to be, For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men.
19½Ã 12:2 They speak falsehood to one another; With flattering lips and with a double heart they speak.
19½Ã 12:3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;
19½Ã 12:4 Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"
19½Ã 12:5 "Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will set him in the safety for which he longs."
19½Ã 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times.
19½Ã 12:7 Thou, O LORD, wilt keep them; Thou wilt preserve him from this generation forever.
19½Ã 12:8 The wicked strut about on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
19½Ã 13:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} How long, O LORD? Wilt Thou forget me forever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?
19½Ã 13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [Having] sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?
19½Ã 13:3 Consider [and] answer me, O LORD, my God; Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death,
19½Ã 13:4 Lest my enemy say, "I have overcome him," [Lest] my adversaries rejoice when I am shaken.
19½Ã 13:5 But I have trusted in Thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.
19½Ã 13:6 I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
19½Ã 14:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David.} The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they have committed abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.
19½Ã 14:2 The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God.
19½Ã 14:3 They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.
19½Ã 14:4 Do all the workers of wickedness not know, Who eat up my people [ as] they eat bread, [And] do not call upon the LORD?
19½Ã 14:5 There they are in great dread, For God is with the righteous generation.
19½Ã 14:6 You would put to shame the counsel of the afflicted, But the LORD is his refuge.
19½Ã 14:7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.
19½Ã 15:1 {A Psalm of David.} O LORD, who may abide in Thy tent? Who may dwell on Thy holy hill?
19½Ã 15:2 He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.
19½Ã 15:3 He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
19½Ã 15:4 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt, and does not change;
19½Ã 15:5 He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
19½Ã 16:1 {A Mikhtam of David.} Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in Thee.
19½Ã 16:2 I said to the LORD, "Thou art my Lord; I have no good besides Thee."
19½Ã 16:3 As for the saints who are in the earth, They are the majestic ones in whom is all my delight.
19½Ã 16:4 The sorrows of those who have bartered for another [god] will be multiplied; I shall not pour out their libations of blood, Nor shall I take their names upon my lips.
19½Ã 16:5 The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; Thou dost support my lot.
19½Ã 16:6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.
19½Ã 16:7 I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.
19½Ã 16:8 I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
19½Ã 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.
19½Ã 16:10 For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt Thou allow Thy Holy One to undergo decay.
19½Ã 16:11 Thou wilt make known to me the path of life; In Thy presence is fulness of joy; In Thy right hand there are pleasures forever.
19½Ã 17:1 {A Prayer of David.} Hear a just cause, O LORD, give heed to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips.
19½Ã 17:2 Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; Let Thine eyes look with equity.
19½Ã 17:3 Thou hast tried my heart; Thou hast visited [me] by night; Thou hast tested me and dost find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
19½Ã 17:4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept from the paths of the violent.
19½Ã 17:5 My steps have held fast to Thy paths. My feet have not slipped.
19½Ã 17:6 I have called upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; Incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.
19½Ã 17:7 Wondrously show Thy lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Thy right hand From those who rise up [against them].
19½Ã 17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,
19½Ã 17:9 From the wicked who despoil me, My deadly enemies, who surround me.
19½Ã 17:10 They have closed their unfeeling [heart]; With their mouth they speak proudly.
19½Ã 17:11 They have now surrounded us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast [us] down to the ground.
19½Ã 17:12 He is like a lion that is eager to tear, And as a young lion lurking in hiding places.
19½Ã 17:13 Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low; Deliver my soul from the wicked with Thy sword,
19½Ã 17:14 From men with Thy hand, O LORD, From men of the world, whose portion is in [this] life; And whose belly Thou dost fill with Thy treasure; They are satisfied with children, And leave their abundance to their babes.
19½Ã 17:15 As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I will be satisfied with Thy likeness when I awake.
19½Ã 18:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD, who} (spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD) (delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And) (he said,) "I love Thee, O LORD, my strength."
19½Ã 18:2 The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
19½Ã 18:3 I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.
19½Ã 18:4 The cords of death encompassed me, And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me.
19½Ã 18:5 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me.
19½Ã 18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His ears.
19½Ã 18:7 Then the earth shook and quaked; And the foundations of the mountains were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry.
19½Ã 18:8 Smoke went up out of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it.
19½Ã 18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet.
19½Ã 18:10 And He rode upon a cherub and flew; And He sped upon the wings of the wind.
19½Ã 18:11 He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
19½Ã 18:12 From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, Hailstones and coals of fire.
19½Ã 18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.
19½Ã 18:14 And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.
19½Ã 18:15 Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Thy rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.
19½Ã 18:16 He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
19½Ã 18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
19½Ã 18:18 They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my stay.
19½Ã 18:19 He brought me forth also into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
19½Ã 18:20 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
19½Ã 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
19½Ã 18:22 For all His ordinances were before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me.
19½Ã 18:23 I was also blameless with Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.
19½Ã 18:24 Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.
19½Ã 18:25 With the kind Thou dost show Thyself kind; With the blameless Thou dost show Thyself blameless;
19½Ã 18:26 With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; And with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself astute.
19½Ã 18:27 For Thou dost save an afflicted people; But haughty eyes Thou dost abase.
19½Ã 18:28 For Thou dost light my lamp; The LORD my God illumines my darkness.
19½Ã 18:29 For by Thee I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall.
19½Ã 18:30 As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
19½Ã 18:31 For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God,
19½Ã 18:32 The God who girds me with strength, And makes my way blameless?
19½Ã 18:33 He makes my feet like hinds' [feet], And sets me upon my high places.
19½Ã 18:34 He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
19½Ã 18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of Thy salvation, And Thy right hand upholds me; And Thy gentleness makes me great.
19½Ã 18:36 Thou dost enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.
19½Ã 18:37 I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
19½Ã 18:38 I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise; They fell under my feet.
19½Ã 18:39 For Thou hast girded me with strength for battle; Thou hast subdued under me those who rose up against me.
19½Ã 18:40 Thou hast also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me.
19½Ã 18:41 They cried for help, but there was none to save, [Even] to the LORD, but He did not answer them.
19½Ã 18:42 Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets.
19½Ã 18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people; Thou hast placed me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me.
19½Ã 18:44 As soon as they hear, they obey me; Foreigners submit to me.
19½Ã 18:45 Foreigners fade away, And come trembling out of their fortresses.
19½Ã 18:46 The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,
19½Ã 18:47 The God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me.
19½Ã 18:48 He delivers me from my enemies; Surely Thou dost lift me above those who rise up against me; Thou dost rescue me from the violent man.
19½Ã 18:49 Therefore I will give thanks to Thee among the nations, O LORD, And I will sing praises to Thy name.
19½Ã 18:50 He gives great deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever.
19½Ã 19:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.
19½Ã 19:2 Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.
19½Ã 19:3 There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.
19½Ã 19:4 Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their utterances to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun,
19½Ã 19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
19½Ã 19:6 Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end of them; And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
19½Ã 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
19½Ã 19:8 The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
19½Ã 19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.
19½Ã 19:10 They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.
19½Ã 19:11 Moreover, by them Thy servant is warned; In keeping them there is great reward.
19½Ã 19:12 Who can discern [his] errors? Acquit me of hidden [faults.]
19½Ã 19:13 Also keep back Thy servant from presumptuous [sins]; Let them not rule over me; Then I shall be blameless, And I shall be acquitted of great transgression.
19½Ã 19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Thy sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.
19½Ã 20:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you [securely] on high!
19½Ã 20:2 May He send you help from the sanctuary, And support you from Zion!
19½Ã 20:3 May He remember all your meal offerings, And find your burnt offering acceptable! Selah.
19½Ã 20:4 May He grant you your heart's desire, And fulfill all your counsel!
19½Ã 20:5 We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
19½Ã 20:6 Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven, With the saving strength of His right hand.
19½Ã 20:7 Some [boast] in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.
19½Ã 20:8 They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.
19½Ã 20:9 Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.
19½Ã 21:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} O LORD, in Thy strength the king will be glad, And in Thy salvation how greatly he will rejoice!
19½Ã 21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, And Thou hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
19½Ã 21:3 For Thou dost meet him with the blessings of good things; Thou dost set a crown of fine gold on his head.
19½Ã 21:4 He asked life of Thee, Thou didst give it to him, Length of days forever and ever.
19½Ã 21:5 His glory is great through Thy salvation, Splendor and majesty Thou dost place upon him.
19½Ã 21:6 For Thou dost make him most blessed forever; Thou dost make him joyful with gladness in Thy presence.
19½Ã 21:7 For the king trusts in the LORD, And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he will not be shaken.
19½Ã 21:8 Your hand will find out all your enemies; Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
19½Ã 21:9 You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them.
19½Ã 21:10 Their offspring Thou wilt destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men.
19½Ã 21:11 Though they intended evil against Thee, [And] devised a plot, They will not succeed.
19½Ã 21:12 For Thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt aim with Thy bowstrings at their faces.
19½Ã 21:13 Be Thou exalted, O LORD, in Thy strength; We will sing and praise Thy power.
19½Ã 22:1 {For the choir director; upon Aijeleth Hashshahar. A Psalm of David.} My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.
19½Ã 22:2 O my God, I cry by day, but Thou dost not answer; And by night, but I have no rest.
19½Ã 22:3 Yet Thou art holy, O Thou who art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
19½Ã 22:4 In Thee our fathers trusted; They trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.
19½Ã 22:5 To Thee they cried out, and were delivered; In Thee they trusted, and were not disappointed.
19½Ã 22:6 But I am a worm, and not a man, A reproach of men, and despised by the people.
19½Ã 22:7 All who see me sneer at me; They separate with the lip, they wag the head, [saying,]
19½Ã 22:8 "Commit [yourself] to the LORD; let Him deliver him; Let Him rescue him, because He delights in him."
19½Ã 22:9 Yet Thou art He who didst bring me forth from the womb; Thou didst make me trust [when] upon my mother's breasts.
19½Ã 22:10 Upon Thee I was cast from birth; Thou hast been my God from my mother's womb.
19½Ã 22:11 Be not far from me, for trouble is near; For there is none to help.
19½Ã 22:12 Many bulls have surrounded me; Strong [bulls] of Bashan have encircled me.
19½Ã 22:13 They open wide their mouth at me, As a ravening and a roaring lion.
19½Ã 22:14 I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.
19½Ã 22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And my tongue cleaves to my jaws; And Thou dost lay me in the dust of death.
19½Ã 22:16 For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.
19½Ã 22:17 I can count all my bones. They look, they stare at me;
19½Ã 22:18 They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots.
19½Ã 22:19 But Thou, O LORD, be not far off; O Thou my help, hasten to my assistance.
19½Ã 22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword, My only [life] from the power of the dog.
19½Ã 22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth; And from the horns of the wild oxen Thou dost answer me.
19½Ã 22:22 I will tell of Thy name to my brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will praise Thee.
19½Ã 22:23 You who fear the LORD, praise Him; All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, And stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel.
19½Ã 22:24 For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither has He hidden His face from him; But when he cried to Him for help, He heard.
19½Ã 22:25 From Thee [comes] my praise in the great assembly; I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him.
19½Ã 22:26 The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; Those who seek Him will praise the LORD. Let your heart live forever!
19½Ã 22:27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, And all the families of the nations will worship before Thee.
19½Ã 22:28 For the kingdom is the Lord's, And He rules over the nations.
19½Ã 22:29 All the prosperous of the earth will eat and worship, All those who go down to the dust will bow before Him, Even he who cannot keep his soul alive.
19½Ã 22:30 Posterity will serve Him; It will be told of the LORD to the [coming] generation.
19½Ã 22:31 They will come and will declare His righteousness To a people who will be born, that He has performed [it.]
19½Ã 23:1 {A Psalm of David.} The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.
19½Ã 23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
19½Ã 23:3 He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake.
19½Ã 23:4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
19½Ã 23:5 Thou dost prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.
19½Ã 23:6 Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
19½Ã 24:1 {A Psalm of David.} The earth is the Lord's, and all it contains, The world, and those who dwell in it.
19½Ã 24:2 For He has founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the rivers.
19½Ã 24:3 Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? And who may stand in His holy place?
19½Ã 24:4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, And has not sworn deceitfully.
19½Ã 24:5 He shall receive a blessing from the LORD And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
19½Ã 24:6 This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Thy face-- [ even] Jacob. Selah.
19½Ã 24:7 Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!
19½Ã 24:8 Who is the King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, The LORD mighty in battle.
19½Ã 24:9 Lift up your heads, O gates, And lift [them] up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!
19½Ã 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.
19½Ã 25:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} To Thee, O LORD, I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 25:2 O my God, in Thee I trust, Do not let me be ashamed; Do not let my enemies exult over me.
19½Ã 25:3 Indeed, none of those who wait for Thee will be ashamed; Those who deal treacherously without cause will be ashamed.
19½Ã 25:4 Make me know Thy ways, O LORD; Teach me Thy paths.
19½Ã 25:5 Lead me in Thy truth and teach me, For Thou art the God of my salvation; For Thee I wait all the day.
19½Ã 25:6 Remember, O LORD, Thy compassion and Thy lovingkindnesses, For they have been from of old.
19½Ã 25:7 Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; According to Thy lovingkindness remember Thou me, For Thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
19½Ã 25:8 Good and upright is the LORD; Therefore He instructs sinners in the way.
19½Ã 25:9 He leads the humble in justice, And He teaches the humble His way.
19½Ã 25:10 All the paths of the LORD are lovingkindness and truth To those who keep His covenant and His testimonies.
19½Ã 25:11 For Thy name's sake, O LORD, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
19½Ã 25:12 Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way he should choose.
19½Ã 25:13 His soul will abide in prosperity, And his descendants will inherit the land.
19½Ã 25:14 The secret of the LORD is for those who fear Him, And He will make them know His covenant.
19½Ã 25:15 My eyes are continually toward the LORD, For He will pluck my feet out of the net.
19½Ã 25:16 Turn to me and be gracious to me, For I am lonely and afflicted.
19½Ã 25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged; Bring me out of my distresses.
19½Ã 25:18 Look upon my affliction and my trouble, And forgive all my sins.
19½Ã 25:19 Look upon my enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with violent hatred.
19½Ã 25:20 Guard my soul and deliver me; Do not let me be ashamed, for I take refuge in Thee.
19½Ã 25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for Thee.
19½Ã 25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles.
19½Ã 26:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity; And I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
19½Ã 26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my heart.
19½Ã 26:3 For Thy lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Thy truth.
19½Ã 26:4 I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with pretenders.
19½Ã 26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers, And I will not sit with the wicked.
19½Ã 26:6 I shall wash my hands in innocence, And I will go about Thine altar, O LORD,
19½Ã 26:7 That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, And declare all Thy wonders.
19½Ã 26:8 O LORD, I love the habitation of Thy house, And the place where Thy glory dwells.
19½Ã 26:9 Do not take my soul away [along] with sinners, Nor my life with men of bloodshed,
19½Ã 26:10 In whose hands is a wicked scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.
19½Ã 26:11 But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious to me.
19½Ã 26:12 My foot stands on a level place; In the congregations I shall bless the LORD.
19½Ã 27:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} The LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; Whom shall I dread?
19½Ã 27:2 When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.
19½Ã 27:3 Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear; Though war arise against me, In [spite of] this I shall be confident.
19½Ã 27:4 One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek£º That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD, And to meditate in His temple.
19½Ã 27:5 For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me; He will lift me up on a rock.
19½Ã 27:6 And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me; And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.
19½Ã 27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, And be gracious to me and answer me.
19½Ã 27:8 [When Thou didst say,] "Seek My face," my heart said to Thee, "Thy face, O LORD, I shall seek."
19½Ã 27:9 Do not hide Thy face from me, Do not turn Thy servant away in anger; Thou hast been my help; Do not abandon me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation!
19½Ã 27:10 For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the LORD will take me up.
19½Ã 27:11 Teach me Thy way, O LORD, And lead me in a level path, Because of my foes.
19½Ã 27:12 Do not deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence.
19½Ã 27:13 [I would have despaired] unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living.
19½Ã 27:14 Wait for the LORD; Be strong, and let your heart take courage; Yes, wait for the LORD.
19½Ã 28:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} To Thee, O LORD, I call; My rock, do not be deaf to me, Lest, if Thou be silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.
19½Ã 28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to Thee for help, When I lift up my hands toward Thy holy sanctuary.
19½Ã 28:3 Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who work iniquity; Who speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts.
19½Ã 28:4 Requite them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands; Repay them their recompense.
19½Ã 28:5 Because they do not regard the works of the LORD Nor the deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up.
19½Ã 28:6 Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplication.
19½Ã 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank Him.
19½Ã 28:8 The LORD is their strength, And He is a saving defense to His anointed.
19½Ã 28:9 Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; Be their shepherd also, and carry them forever.
19½Ã 29:1 {A Psalm of David.} Ascribe to the LORD, O sons of the mighty, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
19½Ã 29:2 Ascribe to the LORD the glory due to His name; Worship the LORD in holy array.
19½Ã 29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; The God of glory thunders, The LORD is over many waters.
19½Ã 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful, The voice of the LORD is majestic.
19½Ã 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; Yes, the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
19½Ã 29:6 And He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, And Sirion like a young wild ox.
19½Ã 29:7 The voice of the LORD hews out flames of fire.
19½Ã 29:8 The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
19½Ã 29:9 The voice of the LORD makes the deer to calve, And strips the forests bare, And in His temple everything says, "Glory!"
19½Ã 29:10 The LORD sat [as King] at the flood; Yes, the LORD sits as King forever.
19½Ã 29:11 The LORD will give strength to His people; The LORD will bless His people with peace.
19½Ã 30:1 {A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. [A Psalm] of David.} I will extol Thee, O LORD, for Thou hast lifted me up, And hast not let my enemies rejoice over me.
19½Ã 30:2 O LORD my God, I cried to Thee for help, and Thou didst heal me.
19½Ã 30:3 O LORD, Thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
19½Ã 30:4 Sing praise to the LORD, you His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy name.
19½Ã 30:5 For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy [comes] in the morning.
19½Ã 30:6 Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, "I will never be moved."
19½Ã 30:7 O LORD, by Thy favor Thou hast made my mountain to stand strong; Thou didst hide Thy face, I was dismayed.
19½Ã 30:8 To Thee, O LORD, I called, And to the Lord I made supplication£º
19½Ã 30:9 "What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise Thee? Will it declare Thy faithfulness?
19½Ã 30:10 "Hear, O LORD, and be gracious to me; O LORD, be Thou my helper."
19½Ã 30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness;
19½Ã 30:12 That [my] soul may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to Thee forever.
19½Ã 31:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} In Thee, O LORD, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; In Thy righteousness deliver me.
19½Ã 31:2 Incline Thine ear to me, rescue me quickly; Be Thou to me a rock of strength, A stronghold to save me.
19½Ã 31:3 For Thou art my rock and my fortress; For Thy name's sake Thou wilt lead me and guide me.
19½Ã 31:4 Thou wilt pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me; For Thou art my strength.
19½Ã 31:5 Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast ransomed me, O LORD, God of truth.
19½Ã 31:6 I hate those who regard vain idols; But I trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 31:7 I will rejoice and be glad in Thy lovingkindness, Because Thou hast seen my affliction; Thou hast known the troubles of my soul,
19½Ã 31:8 And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a large place.
19½Ã 31:9 Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; My eye is wasted away from grief, my soul and my body [also.]
19½Ã 31:10 For my life is spent with sorrow, And my years with sighing; My strength has failed because of my iniquity, And my body has wasted away.
19½Ã 31:11 Because of all my adversaries, I have become a reproach, Especially to my neighbors, And an object of dread to my acquaintances; Those who see me in the street flee from me.
19½Ã 31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind, I am like a broken vessel.
19½Ã 31:13 For I have heard the slander of many, Terror is on every side; While they took counsel together against me, They schemed to take away my life.
19½Ã 31:14 But as for me, I trust in Thee, O LORD, I say, "Thou art my God."
19½Ã 31:15 My times are in Thy hand; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
19½Ã 31:16 Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; Save me in Thy lovingkindness.
19½Ã 31:17 Let me not be put to shame, O LORD, for I call upon Thee; Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
19½Ã 31:18 Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak arrogantly against the righteous With pride and contempt.
19½Ã 31:19 How great is Thy goodness, Which Thou hast stored up for those who fear Thee, Which Thou hast wrought for those who take refuge in Thee, Before the sons of men!
19½Ã 31:20 Thou dost hide them in the secret place of Thy presence from the conspiracies of man; Thou dost keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues.
19½Ã 31:21 Blessed be the LORD, For He has made marvelous His lovingkindness to me in a besieged city.
19½Ã 31:22 As for me, I said in my alarm, "I am cut off from before Thine eyes"; Nevertheless Thou didst hear the voice of my supplications When I cried to Thee.
19½Ã 31:23 O love the LORD, all you His godly ones! The LORD preserves the faithful, And fully recompenses the proud doer.
19½Ã 31:24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, All you who hope in the LORD.
19½Ã 32:1 {[A Psalm] of David. A Maskil.} How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered!
19½Ã 32:2 How blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit!
19½Ã 32:3 When I kept silent [about my sin], my body wasted away Through my groaning all day long.
19½Ã 32:4 For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was drained away [as] with the fever heat of summer. Selah.
19½Ã 32:5 I acknowledged my sin to Thee, And my iniquity I did not hide; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"; And Thou didst forgive the guilt of my sin. Selah.
19½Ã 32:6 Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; Surely in a flood of great waters they shall not reach him.
19½Ã 32:7 Thou art my hiding place; Thou dost preserve me from trouble; Thou dost surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
19½Ã 32:8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye upon you.
19½Ã 32:9 Do not be as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, Whose trappings include bit and bridle to hold them in check, [Otherwise] they will not come near to you.
19½Ã 32:10 Many are the sorrows of the wicked; But he who trusts in the LORD, lovingkindness shall surround him.
19½Ã 32:11 Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous ones, And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
19½Ã 33:1 Sing for joy in the LORD, O you righteous ones; Praise is becoming to the upright.
19½Ã 33:2 Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings.
19½Ã 33:3 Sing to Him a new song; Play skillfully with a shout of joy.
19½Ã 33:4 For the word of the LORD is upright; And all His work is [done] in faithfulness.
19½Ã 33:5 He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.
19½Ã 33:6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.
19½Ã 33:7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
19½Ã 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
19½Ã 33:9 For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
19½Ã 33:10 The LORD nullifies the counsel of the nations; He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
19½Ã 33:11 The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His heart from generation to generation.
19½Ã 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, The people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance.
19½Ã 33:13 The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men;
19½Ã 33:14 From His dwelling place He looks out On all the inhabitants of the earth,
19½Ã 33:15 He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.
19½Ã 33:16 The king is not saved by a mighty army; A warrior is not delivered by great strength.
19½Ã 33:17 A horse is a false hope for victory; Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength.
19½Ã 33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him, On those who hope for His lovingkindness,
19½Ã 33:19 To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.
19½Ã 33:20 Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
19½Ã 33:21 For our heart rejoices in Him, Because we trust in His holy name.
19½Ã 33:22 Let Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, be upon us, According as we have hoped in Thee.
19½Ã 34:1 {[A Psalm] of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him} (away and he departed.) I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
19½Ã 34:2 My soul shall make its boast in the LORD; The humble shall hear it and rejoice.
19½Ã 34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt His name together.
19½Ã 34:4 I sought the LORD, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
19½Ã 34:5 They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces shall never be ashamed.
19½Ã 34:6 This poor man cried and the LORD heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.
19½Ã 34:7 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, And rescues them.
19½Ã 34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!
19½Ã 34:9 O fear the LORD, you His saints; For to those who fear Him, there is no want.
19½Ã 34:10 The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; But they who seek the LORD shall not be in want of any good thing.
19½Ã 34:11 Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
19½Ã 34:12 Who is the man who desires life, And loves [length of] days that he may see good?
19½Ã 34:13 Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.
19½Ã 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.
19½Ã 34:15 The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, And His ears are [open] to their cry.
19½Ã 34:16 The face of the LORD is against evildoers, To cut off the memory of them from the earth.
19½Ã 34:17 [The righteous] cry and the LORD hears, And delivers them out of all their troubles.
19½Ã 34:18 The LORD is near to the brokenhearted, And saves those who are crushed in spirit.
19½Ã 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But the LORD delivers him out of them all.
19½Ã 34:20 He keeps all his bones; Not one of them is broken.
19½Ã 34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked; And those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
19½Ã 34:22 The LORD redeems the soul of His servants; And none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
19½Ã 35:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; Fight against those who fight against me.
19½Ã 35:2 Take hold of buckler and shield, And rise up for my help.
19½Ã 35:3 Draw also the spear and the battle-axe to meet those who pursue me; Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
19½Ã 35:4 Let those be ashamed and dishonored who seek my life; Let those be turned back and humiliated who devise evil against me.
19½Ã 35:5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, With the angel of the LORD driving [them] on.
19½Ã 35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery, With the angel of the LORD pursuing them.
19½Ã 35:7 For without cause they hid their net for me; Without cause they dug a pit for my soul.
19½Ã 35:8 Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let the net which he hid catch himself; Into that very destruction let him fall.
19½Ã 35:9 And my soul shall rejoice in the LORD; It shall exult in His salvation.
19½Ã 35:10 All my bones will say, "LORD, who is like Thee, Who delivers the afflicted from him who is too strong for him, And the afflicted and the needy from him who robs him?"
19½Ã 35:11 Malicious witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I do not know.
19½Ã 35:12 They repay me evil for good, [To] the bereavement of my soul.
19½Ã 35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fasting; And my prayer kept returning to my bosom.
19½Ã 35:14 I went about as though it were my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one who sorrows for a mother.
19½Ã 35:15 But at my stumbling they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; The smiters whom I did not know gathered together against me, They slandered me without ceasing.
19½Ã 35:16 Like godless jesters at a feast, They gnashed at me with their teeth.
19½Ã 35:17 Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, My only [life] from the lions.
19½Ã 35:18 I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a mighty throng.
19½Ã 35:19 Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me; Neither let those who hate me without cause wink maliciously.
19½Ã 35:20 For they do not speak peace, But they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
19½Ã 35:21 And they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, "Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it!"
19½Ã 35:22 Thou hast seen it, O LORD, do not keep silent; O Lord, do not be far from me.
19½Ã 35:23 Stir up Thyself, and awake to my right, And to my cause, my God and my Lord.
19½Ã 35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness; And do not let them rejoice over me.
19½Ã 35:25 Do not let them say in their heart, "Aha, our desire!" Do not let them say, "We have swallowed him up!"
19½Ã 35:26 Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice at my distress; Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me.
19½Ã 35:27 Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication; And let them say continually, "The LORD be magnified, Who delights in the prosperity of His servant."
19½Ã 35:28 And my tongue shall declare Thy righteousness [And] Thy praise all day long.
19½Ã 36:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.} Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.
19½Ã 36:2 For it flatters him in his [own] eyes, Concerning the discovery of his iniquity [and] the hatred [of it.]
19½Ã 36:3 The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise [and] to do good.
19½Ã 36:4 He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil.
19½Ã 36:5 Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Thy faithfulness [reaches] to the skies.
19½Ã 36:6 Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are [ like] a great deep. O LORD, Thou preservest man and beast.
19½Ã 36:7 How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.
19½Ã 36:8 They drink their fill of the abundance of Thy house; And Thou dost give them to drink of the river of Thy delights.
19½Ã 36:9 For with Thee is the fountain of life; In Thy light we see light.
19½Ã 36:10 O continue Thy lovingkindness to those who know Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
19½Ã 36:11 Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
19½Ã 36:12 There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
19½Ã 37:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} Do not fret because of evildoers, Be not envious toward wrongdoers.
19½Ã 37:2 For they will wither quickly like the grass, And fade like the green herb.
19½Ã 37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
19½Ã 37:4 Delight yourself in the LORD; And He will give you the desires of your heart.
19½Ã 37:5 Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do it.
19½Ã 37:6 And He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your judgment as the noonday.
19½Ã 37:7 Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.
19½Ã 37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret, [it leads] only to evildoing.
19½Ã 37:9 For evildoers will be cut off, But those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land.
19½Ã 37:10 Yet a little while and the wicked man will be no more; And you will look carefully for his place, and he will not be [there.]
19½Ã 37:11 But the humble will inherit the land, And will delight themselves in abundant prosperity.
19½Ã 37:12 The wicked plots against the righteous, And gnashes at him with his teeth.
19½Ã 37:13 The Lord laughs at him; For He sees his day is coming.
19½Ã 37:14 The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow, To cast down the afflicted and the needy, To slay those who are upright in conduct.
19½Ã 37:15 Their sword will enter their own heart, And their bows will be broken.
19½Ã 37:16 Better is the little of the righteous Than the abundance of many wicked.
19½Ã 37:17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken; But the LORD sustains the righteous.
19½Ã 37:18 The LORD knows the days of the blameless; And their inheritance will be forever.
19½Ã 37:19 They will not be ashamed in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they will have abundance.
19½Ã 37:20 But the wicked will perish; And the enemies of the LORD will be like the glory of the pastures, They vanish-- like smoke they vanish away.
19½Ã 37:21 The wicked borrows and does not pay back, But the righteous is gracious and gives.
19½Ã 37:22 For those blessed by Him will inherit the land; But those cursed by Him will be cut off.
19½Ã 37:23 The steps of a man are established by the LORD; And He delights in his way.
19½Ã 37:24 When he falls, he shall not be hurled headlong; Because the LORD is the One who holds his hand.
19½Ã 37:25 I have been young, and now I am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his descendants begging bread.
19½Ã 37:26 All day long he is gracious and lends; And his descendants are a blessing.
19½Ã 37:27 Depart from evil, and do good, So you will abide forever.
19½Ã 37:28 For the LORD loves justice, And does not forsake His godly ones; They are preserved forever; But the descendants of the wicked will be cut off.
19½Ã 37:29 The righteous will inherit the land, And dwell in it forever.
19½Ã 37:30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, And his tongue speaks justice.
19½Ã 37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; His steps do not slip.
19½Ã 37:32 The wicked spies upon the righteous, And seeks to kill him.
19½Ã 37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, Or let him be condemned when he is judged.
19½Ã 37:34 Wait for the LORD, and keep His way, And He will exalt you to inherit the land; When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
19½Ã 37:35 I have seen a violent, wicked man Spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.
19½Ã 37:36 Then he passed away, and lo, he was no more; I sought for him, but he could not be found.
19½Ã 37:37 Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright; For the man of peace will have a posterity.
19½Ã 37:38 But transgressors will be altogether destroyed; The posterity of the wicked will be cut off.
19½Ã 37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their strength in time of trouble.
19½Ã 37:40 And the LORD helps them, and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they take refuge in Him.
19½Ã 38:1 {A Psalm of David, for a memorial.} O LORD, rebuke me not in Thy wrath; And chasten me not in Thy burning anger.
19½Ã 38:2 For Thine arrows have sunk deep into me, And Thy hand has pressed down on me.
19½Ã 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; There is no health in my bones because of my sin.
19½Ã 38:4 For my iniquities are gone over my head; As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me.
19½Ã 38:5 My wounds grow foul [and] fester. Because of my folly,
19½Ã 38:6 I am bent over and greatly bowed down; I go mourning all day long.
19½Ã 38:7 For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.
19½Ã 38:8 I am benumbed and badly crushed; I groan because of the agitation of my heart.
19½Ã 38:9 Lord, all my desire is before Thee; And my sighing is not hidden from Thee.
19½Ã 38:10 My heart throbs, my strength fails me; And the light of my eyes, even that has gone from me.
19½Ã 38:11 My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.
19½Ã 38:12 Those who seek my life lay snares [for me]; And those who seek to injure me have threatened destruction, And they devise treachery all day long.
19½Ã 38:13 But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; And I am like a dumb man who does not open his mouth.
19½Ã 38:14 Yes, I am like a man who does not hear, And in whose mouth are no arguments.
19½Ã 38:15 For I hope in Thee, O LORD; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.
19½Ã 38:16 For I said, "May they not rejoice over me, [Who,] when my foot slips, would magnify themselves against me."
19½Ã 38:17 For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.
19½Ã 38:18 For I confess my iniquity; I am full of anxiety because of my sin.
19½Ã 38:19 But my enemies are vigorous [and] strong; And many are those who hate me wrongfully.
19½Ã 38:20 And those who repay evil for good, They oppose me, because I follow what is good.
19½Ã 38:21 Do not forsake me, O LORD; O my God, do not be far from me!
19½Ã 38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
19½Ã 39:1 {For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.} I said, " I will guard my ways, That I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth as with a muzzle, While the wicked are in my presence. "
19½Ã 39:2 I was dumb and silent, I refrained [even] from good; And my sorrow grew worse.
19½Ã 39:3 My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned; [Then] I spoke with my tongue£º
19½Ã 39:4 "LORD, make me to know my end, And what is the extent of my days, Let me know how transient I am.
19½Ã 39:5 "Behold, Thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths, And my lifetime as nothing in Thy sight, Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Selah.
19½Ã 39:6 "Surely every man walks about as a phantom; Surely they make an uproar for nothing; He amasses [riches], and does not know who will gather them.
19½Ã 39:7 "And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in Thee.
19½Ã 39:8 "Deliver me from all my transgressions; Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
19½Ã 39:9 "I have become dumb, I do not open my mouth, Because it is Thou who hast done [it.]
19½Ã 39:10 "Remove Thy plague from me; Because of the opposition of Thy hand, I am perishing.
19½Ã 39:11 "With reproofs Thou dost chasten a man for iniquity; Thou dost consume as a moth what is precious to him; Surely every man is a mere breath. Selah.
19½Ã 39:12 "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with Thee, A sojourner like all my fathers.
19½Ã 39:13 "Turn Thy gaze away from me, that I may smile [again], Before I depart and am no more."
19½Ã 40:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} I waited patiently for the LORD; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry.
19½Ã 40:2 He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay; And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm.
19½Ã 40:3 And He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear, And will trust in the LORD.
19½Ã 40:4 How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.
19½Ã 40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders which Thou hast done, And Thy thoughts toward us; There is none to compare with Thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count.
19½Ã 40:6 Sacrifice and meal offering Thou hast not desired; My ears Thou hast opened; Burnt offering and sin offering Thou hast not required.
19½Ã 40:7 Then I said, "Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me;
19½Ã 40:8 I delight to do Thy will, O my God; Thy Law is within my heart. "
19½Ã 40:9 I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, O LORD, Thou knowest.
19½Ã 40:10 I have not hidden Thy righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth from the great congregation.
19½Ã 40:11 Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassion from me; Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth will continually preserve me.
19½Ã 40:12 For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.
19½Ã 40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; Make haste, O LORD, to help me.
19½Ã 40:14 Let those be ashamed and humiliated together Who seek my life to destroy it; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.
19½Ã 40:15 Let those be appalled because of their shame Who say to me, "Aha, aha!"
19½Ã 40:16 Let all who seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; Let those who love Thy salvation say continually, "The LORD be magnified!"
19½Ã 40:17 Since I am afflicted and needy, Let the Lord be mindful of me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; Do not delay, O my God.
19½Ã 41:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} How blessed is he who considers the helpless; The LORD will deliver him in a day of trouble.
19½Ã 41:2 The LORD will protect him, and keep him alive, And he shall be called blessed upon the earth; And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies.
19½Ã 41:3 The LORD will sustain him upon his sickbed; In his illness, Thou dost restore him to health.
19½Ã 41:4 As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee."
19½Ã 41:5 My enemies speak evil against me, "When will he die, and his name perish?"
19½Ã 41:6 And when he comes to see [me], he speaks falsehood; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; When he goes outside, he tells it.
19½Ã 41:7 All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt, [saying,]
19½Ã 41:8 "A wicked thing is poured out upon him, That when he lies down, he will not rise up again."
19½Ã 41:9 Even my close friend, in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.
19½Ã 41:10 But Thou, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, That I may repay them.
19½Ã 41:11 By this I know that Thou art pleased with me, Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
19½Ã 41:12 As for me, Thou dost uphold me in my integrity, And Thou dost set me in Thy presence forever.
19½Ã 41:13 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
19½Ã 42:1 {For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.} As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for Thee, O God.
19½Ã 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God?
19½Ã 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, While [they] say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19½Ã 42:4 These things I remember, and I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go along with the throng [and] lead them in procession to the house of God, With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.
19½Ã 42:5 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And [why] have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him [For] the help of His presence.
19½Ã 42:6 O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I remember Thee from the land of the Jordan, And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
19½Ã 42:7 Deep calls to deep at the sound of Thy waterfalls; All Thy breakers and Thy waves have rolled over me.
19½Ã 42:8 The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.
19½Ã 42:9 I will say to God my rock, "Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
19½Ã 42:10 As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19½Ã 42:11 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance, and my God.
19½Ã 43:1 Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
19½Ã 43:2 For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
19½Ã 43:3 O send out Thy light and Thy truth, let them lead me; Let them bring me to Thy holy hill, And to Thy dwelling places.
19½Ã 43:4 Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise Thee, O God, my God.
19½Ã 43:5 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him, The help of my countenance, and my God.
19½Ã 44:1 {For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.} O God, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us, The work that Thou didst in their days, In the days of old.
19½Ã 44:2 Thou with Thine own hand didst drive out the nations; Then Thou didst plant them; Thou didst afflict the peoples, Then Thou didst spread them abroad.
19½Ã 44:3 For by their own sword they did not possess the land; And their own arm did not save them; But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy presence, For Thou didst favor them.
19½Ã 44:4 Thou art my King, O God; Command victories for Jacob.
19½Ã 44:5 Through Thee we will push back our adversaries; Through Thy name we will trample down those who rise up against us.
19½Ã 44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, Nor will my sword save me.
19½Ã 44:7 But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And Thou hast put to shame those who hate us.
19½Ã 44:8 In God we have boasted all day long, And we will give thanks to Thy name forever. Selah.
19½Ã 44:9 Yet Thou hast rejected [us] and brought us to dishonor, And dost not go out with our armies.
19½Ã 44:10 Thou dost cause us to turn back from the adversary; And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.
19½Ã 44:11 Thou dost give us as sheep to be eaten, And hast scattered us among the nations.
19½Ã 44:12 Thou dost sell Thy people cheaply, And hast not profited by their sale.
19½Ã 44:13 Thou dost make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those around us.
19½Ã 44:14 Thou dost make us a byword among the nations, A laughingstock among the peoples.
19½Ã 44:15 All day long my dishonor is before me, And my humiliation has overwhelmed me,
19½Ã 44:16 Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, Because of the presence of the enemy and the avenger.
19½Ã 44:17 All this has come upon us, but we have not forgotten Thee, And we have not dealt falsely with Thy covenant.
19½Ã 44:18 Our heart has not turned back, And our steps have not deviated from Thy way,
19½Ã 44:19 Yet Thou hast crushed us in a place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
19½Ã 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or extended our hands to a strange god;
19½Ã 44:21 Would not God find this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
19½Ã 44:22 But for Thy sake we are killed all day long; We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
19½Ã 44:23 Arouse Thyself, why dost Thou sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not reject us forever.
19½Ã 44:24 Why dost Thou hide Thy face, And forget our affliction and our oppression?
19½Ã 44:25 For our soul has sunk down into the dust; Our body cleaves to the earth.
19½Ã 44:26 Rise up, be our help, And redeem us for the sake of Thy lovingkindness.
19½Ã 45:1 {For the choir director; according to the Shoshannim. A Maskil of the sons of} (Korah. A Song of Love.) My heart overflows with a good theme; I address my verses to the King; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
19½Ã 45:2 Thou art fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Thy lips; Therefore God has blessed Thee forever.
19½Ã 45:3 Gird Thy sword on [Thy] thigh, O Mighty One, [In] Thy splendor and Thy majesty!
19½Ã 45:4 And in Thy majesty ride on victoriously, For the cause of truth and meekness [and] righteousness; Let Thy right hand teach Thee awesome things.
19½Ã 45:5 Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under Thee; [Thine arrows are] in the heart of the King's enemies.
19½Ã 45:6 Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Thy kingdom.
19½Ã 45:7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; Therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee With the oil of joy above Thy fellows.
19½Ã 45:8 All Thy garments are [fragrant with] myrrh and aloes [and] cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made Thee glad.
19½Ã 45:9 Kings' daughters are among Thy noble ladies; At Thy right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.
19½Ã 45:10 Listen, O daughter, give attention and incline your ear; Forget your people and your father's house;
19½Ã 45:11 Then the King will desire your beauty; Because He is your Lord, bow down to Him.
19½Ã 45:12 And the daughter of Tyre [will come] with a gift; The rich among the people will entreat your favor.
19½Ã 45:13 The King's daughter is all glorious within; Her clothing is interwoven with gold.
19½Ã 45:14 She will be led to the King in embroidered work; The virgins, her companions who follow her, Will be brought to Thee.
19½Ã 45:15 They will be led forth with gladness and rejoicing; They will enter into the King's palace.
19½Ã 45:16 In place of your fathers will be your sons; You shall make them princes in all the earth.
19½Ã 45:17 I will cause Thy name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the peoples will give Thee thanks forever and ever.
19½Ã 46:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah, set to Alamoth. A Song.} God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.
19½Ã 46:2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, And though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea;
19½Ã 46:3 Though its waters roar [and] foam, Though the mountains quake at its swelling pride. Selah.
19½Ã 46:4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, The holy dwelling places of the Most High.
19½Ã 46:5 God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.
19½Ã 46:6 The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth melted.
19½Ã 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
19½Ã 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, Who has wrought desolations in the earth.
19½Ã 46:9 He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.
19½Ã 46:10 "Cease [striving] and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."
19½Ã 46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.
19½Ã 47:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.} O Clap your hands, all peoples; Shout to God with the voice of joy.
19½Ã 47:2 For the LORD Most High is to be feared, A great King over all the earth.
19½Ã 47:3 He subdues peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
19½Ã 47:4 He chooses our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom He loves. Selah.
19½Ã 47:5 God has ascended with a shout, The LORD, with the sound of a trumpet.
19½Ã 47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises; Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
19½Ã 47:7 For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with a skillful psalm.
19½Ã 47:8 God reigns over the nations, God sits on His holy throne.
19½Ã 47:9 The princes of the people have assembled themselves [as] the people of the God of Abraham; For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.
19½Ã 48:1 {A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.} Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, His holy mountain.
19½Ã 48:2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion [ in] the far north, The city of the great King.
19½Ã 48:3 God, in her palaces, Has made Himself known as a stronghold.
19½Ã 48:4 For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.
19½Ã 48:5 They saw [it], then they were amazed; They were terrified, they fled in alarm.
19½Ã 48:6 Panic seized them there, Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth.
19½Ã 48:7 With the east wind Thou dost break the ships of Tarshish.
19½Ã 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah.
19½Ã 48:9 We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of Thy temple.
19½Ã 48:10 As is Thy name, O God, So is Thy praise to the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
19½Ã 48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of Thy judgments.
19½Ã 48:12 Walk about Zion, and go around her; Count her towers;
19½Ã 48:13 Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces; That you may tell [ it] to the next generation.
19½Ã 48:14 For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will guide us until death.
19½Ã 49:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.} Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
19½Ã 49:2 Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
19½Ã 49:3 My mouth will speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart [will be] understanding.
19½Ã 49:4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will express my riddle on the harp.
19½Ã 49:5 Why should I fear in days of adversity, When the iniquity of my foes surrounds me,
19½Ã 49:6 Even those who trust in their wealth, And boast in the abundance of their riches?
19½Ã 49:7 No man can by any means redeem [his] brother, Or give to God a ransom for him--
19½Ã 49:8 For the redemption of his soul is costly, And he should cease [trying] forever--
19½Ã 49:9 That he should live on eternally; That he should not undergo decay.
19½Ã 49:10 For he sees [that even] wise men die; The stupid and the senseless alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.
19½Ã 49:11 Their inner thought is, [that] their houses are forever, [And] their dwelling places to all generations; They have called their lands after their own names.
19½Ã 49:12 But man in [his] pomp will not endure; He is like the beasts that perish.
19½Ã 49:13 This is the way of those who are foolish, And of those after them who approve their words. Selah.
19½Ã 49:14 As sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall rule over them in the morning; And their form shall be for Sheol to consume, So that they have no habitation.
19½Ã 49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For He will receive me. Selah.
19½Ã 49:16 Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the glory of his house is increased;
19½Ã 49:17 For when he dies he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.
19½Ã 49:18 Though while he lives he congratulates himself-- And though [men] praise you when you do well for yourself--
19½Ã 49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.
19½Ã 49:20 Man in [his] pomp, yet without understanding, Is like the beasts that perish.
19½Ã 50:1 {A Psalm of Asaph.} The Mighty One, God, the LORD, has spoken, And summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
19½Ã 50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.
19½Ã 50:3 May our God come and not keep silence; Fire devours before Him, And it is very tempestuous around Him.
19½Ã 50:4 He summons the heavens above, And the earth, to judge His people£º
19½Ã 50:5 "Gather My godly ones to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."
19½Ã 50:6 And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is judge. Selah.
19½Ã 50:7 "Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you; I am God, your God.
19½Ã 50:8 "I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, And your burnt offerings are continually before Me.
19½Ã 50:9 "I shall take no young bull out of your house, Nor male goats out of your folds.
19½Ã 50:10 "For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.
19½Ã 50:11 "I know every bird of the mountains, And everything that moves in the field is Mine.
19½Ã 50:12 "If I were hungry, I would not tell you; For the world is Mine, and all it contains.
19½Ã 50:13 "Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of male goats?
19½Ã 50:14 "Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And pay your vows to the Most High;
19½Ã 50:15 And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me. "
19½Ã 50:16 But to the wicked God says, "What right have you to tell of My statutes, And to take My covenant in your mouth?
19½Ã 50:17 "For you hate discipline, And you cast My words behind you.
19½Ã 50:18 "When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, And you associate with adulterers.
19½Ã 50:19 "You let your mouth loose in evil, And your tongue frames deceit.
19½Ã 50:20 "You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son.
19½Ã 50:21 "These things you have done, and I kept silence; You thought that I was just like you; I will reprove you, and state [the case] in order before your eyes.
19½Ã 50:22 "Now consider this, you who forget God, Lest I tear [you] in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
19½Ã 50:23 "He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; And to him who orders [his] way [aright] I shall show the salvation of God."
19½Ã 51:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him,} (after he had gone in to Bathsheba.) Be gracious to me, O God, according to Thy lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Thy compassion blot out my transgressions.
19½Ã 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.
19½Ã 51:3 For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
19½Ã 51:4 Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done what is evil in Thy sight, So that Thou art justified when Thou dost speak, And blameless when Thou dost judge.
19½Ã 51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.
19½Ã 51:6 Behold, Thou dost desire truth in the innermost being, And in the hidden part Thou wilt make me know wisdom.
19½Ã 51:7 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
19½Ã 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice.
19½Ã 51:9 Hide Thy face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities.
19½Ã 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19½Ã 51:11 Do not cast me away from Thy presence, And do not take Thy Holy Spirit from me.
19½Ã 51:12 Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And sustain me with a willing spirit.
19½Ã 51:13 [Then] I will teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners will be converted to Thee.
19½Ã 51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; [Then] my tongue will joyfully sing of Thy righteousness.
19½Ã 51:15 O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Thy praise.
19½Ã 51:16 For Thou dost not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; Thou art not pleased with burnt offering.
19½Ã 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.
19½Ã 51:18 By Thy favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.
19½Ã 51:19 Then Thou wilt delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then young bulls will be offered on Thine altar.
19½Ã 52:1 {For the choir director. A Maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told} (Saul, and said to him, "David has come to the house of Ahimelech.") Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God [endures] all day long.
19½Ã 52:2 Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit.
19½Ã 52:3 You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.
19½Ã 52:4 You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
19½Ã 52:5 But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up, and tear you away from [your] tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.
19½Ã 52:6 And the righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, [saying,]
19½Ã 52:7 "Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, [And] was strong in his [evil] desire."
19½Ã 52:8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.
19½Ã 52:9 I will give Thee thanks forever, because Thou hast done [it], And I will wait on Thy name, for [it is] good, in the presence of Thy godly ones.
19½Ã 53:1 {For the choir director; according to Mahalath. A Maskil of David.} The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God," They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good.
19½Ã 53:2 God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God.
19½Ã 53:3 Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.
19½Ã 53:4 Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up My people [as though] they ate bread, And have not called upon God?
19½Ã 53:5 There they were in great fear [where] no fear had been; For God scattered the bones of him who encamped against you; You put [them] to shame, because God had rejected them.
19½Ã 53:6 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores His captive people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
19½Ã 54:1 {For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the} (Ziphites came and said to Saul, "Is not David hiding himself among us?") Save me, O God, by Thy name, And vindicate me by Thy power.
19½Ã 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
19½Ã 54:3 For strangers have risen against me, And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah.
19½Ã 54:4 Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.
19½Ã 54:5 He will recompense the evil to my foes; Destroy them in Thy faithfulness.
19½Ã 54:6 Willingly I will sacrifice to Thee; I will give thanks to Thy name, O LORD, for it is good.
19½Ã 54:7 For He has delivered me from all trouble; And my eye has looked [with satisfaction] upon my enemies.
19½Ã 55:1 {For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Maskil of David.} Give ear to my prayer, O God; And do not hide Thyself from my supplication.
19½Ã 55:2 Give heed to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and am surely distracted,
19½Ã 55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the pressure of the wicked; For they bring down trouble upon me, And in anger they bear a grudge against me.
19½Ã 55:4 My heart is in anguish within me, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
19½Ã 55:5 Fear and trembling come upon me; And horror has overwhelmed me.
19½Ã 55:6 And I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
19½Ã 55:7 "Behold, I would wander far away, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.
19½Ã 55:8 "I would hasten to my place of refuge From the stormy wind [and] tempest."
19½Ã 55:9 Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongues, For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
19½Ã 55:10 Day and night they go around her upon her walls; And iniquity and mischief are in her midst.
19½Ã 55:11 Destruction is in her midst; Oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets.
19½Ã 55:12 For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, Then I could bear [it]; Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me, Then I could hide myself from him.
19½Ã 55:13 But it is you, a man my equal, My companion and my familiar friend.
19½Ã 55:14 We who had sweet fellowship together, Walked in the house of God in the throng.
19½Ã 55:15 Let death come deceitfully upon them; Let them go down alive to Sheol, For evil is in their dwelling, in their midst.
19½Ã 55:16 As for me, I shall call upon God, And the LORD will save me.
19½Ã 55:17 Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and murmur, And He will hear my voice.
19½Ã 55:18 He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle [which is] against me, For they are many [who strive] with me.
19½Ã 55:19 God will hear and answer them-- Even the one who sits enthroned from of old-- Selah. With whom there is no change, And who do not fear God.
19½Ã 55:20 He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has violated his covenant.
19½Ã 55:21 His speech was smoother than butter, But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords.
19½Ã 55:22 Cast your burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
19½Ã 55:23 But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down to the pit of destruction; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in Thee.
19½Ã 56:1 {For the choir director; according to Jonath elem rehokim. A Mikhtam of David,} (when the Philistines seized him in Gath.) Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled upon me; Fighting all day long he oppresses me.
19½Ã 56:2 My foes have trampled upon me all day long, For they are many who fight proudly against me.
19½Ã 56:3 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.
19½Ã 56:4 In God, whose word I praise, In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can [mere] man do to me?
19½Ã 56:5 All day long they distort my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
19½Ã 56:6 They attack, they lurk, They watch my steps, As they have waited [to take] my life.
19½Ã 56:7 Because of wickedness, cast them forth, In anger put down the peoples, O God!
19½Ã 56:8 Thou hast taken account of my wanderings; Put my tears in Thy bottle; Are [they] not in Thy book?
19½Ã 56:9 Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call; This I know, that God is for me.
19½Ã 56:10 In God, [whose] word I praise, In the LORD, [whose] word I praise,
19½Ã 56:11 In God I have put my trust, I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?
19½Ã 56:12 Thy vows are [binding] upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to Thee.
19½Ã 56:13 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living.
19½Ã 57:1 {For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David, when he fled} (from Saul, in the cave.) Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in Thee; And in the shadow of Thy wings I will take refuge, Until destruction passes by.
19½Ã 57:2 I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes [all things] for me.
19½Ã 57:3 He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth.
19½Ã 57:4 My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, [Even] the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
19½Ã 57:5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God; [Let] Thy glory [be] above all the earth.
19½Ã 57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They [themselves] have fallen into the midst of it. Selah.
19½Ã 57:7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!
19½Ã 57:8 Awake, my glory; Awake, harp and lyre, I will awaken the dawn!
19½Ã 57:9 I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
19½Ã 57:10 For Thy lovingkindness is great to the heavens, And Thy truth to the clouds.
19½Ã 57:11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God; [Let] Thy glory [be] above all the earth.
19½Ã 58:1 {For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David.} Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
19½Ã 58:2 No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
19½Ã 58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.
19½Ã 58:4 They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,
19½Ã 58:5 So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, [Or] a skillful caster of spells.
19½Ã 58:6 O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.
19½Ã 58:7 Let them flow away like water that runs off; [When] he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.
19½Ã 58:8 [Let them be] as a snail which melts away as it goes along, [Like] the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun.
19½Ã 58:9 Before your pots can feel [the fire of] thorns, He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
19½Ã 58:10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
19½Ã 58:11 And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!"
19½Ã 59:1 {For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of David, when Saul} (sent [men,] and they watched the house in order to kill him.) Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; Set me [securely] on high away from those who rise up against me.
19½Ã 59:2 Deliver me from those who do iniquity, And save me from men of bloodshed.
19½Ã 59:3 For behold, they have set an ambush for my life; Fierce men launch an attack against me, Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O LORD,
19½Ã 59:4 For no guilt of [mine], they run and set themselves against me. Arouse Thyself to help me, and see!
19½Ã 59:5 And Thou, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any [who are] treacherous in iniquity. Selah.
19½Ã 59:6 They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
19½Ã 59:7 Behold, they belch forth with their mouth; Swords are in their lips, For, [they say,] "Who hears?"
19½Ã 59:8 But Thou, O LORD, dost laugh at them; Thou dost scoff at all the nations.
19½Ã 59:9 [Because of] his strength I will watch for Thee, For God is my stronghold.
19½Ã 59:10 My God in His lovingkindness will meet me; God will let me look [triumphantly] upon my foes.
19½Ã 59:11 Do not slay them, lest my people forget; Scatter them by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
19½Ã 59:12 [On account of] the sin of their mouth [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be caught in their pride, And on account of curses and lies which they utter.
19½Ã 59:13 Destroy [them] in wrath, destroy [them], that they may be no more; That [men] may know that God rules in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.
19½Ã 59:14 And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go around the city.
19½Ã 59:15 They wander about for food, And growl if they are not satisfied.
19½Ã 59:16 But as for me, I shall sing of Thy strength; Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Thy lovingkindness in the morning, For Thou hast been my stronghold, And a refuge in the day of my distress.
19½Ã 59:17 O my strength, I will sing praises to Thee; For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me lovingkindness.
19½Ã 60:1 {For the choir director; according to Shushan Eduth. A Mikhtam of David, to} (teach; when he struggled with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab) (returned, and smote twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.) O God, Thou hast rejected us. Thou hast broken us; Thou hast been angry; O, restore us.
19½Ã 60:2 Thou hast made the land quake, Thou hast split it open; Heal its breaches, for it totters.
19½Ã 60:3 Thou hast made Thy people experience hardship; Thou hast given us wine to drink that makes us stagger.
19½Ã 60:4 Thou hast given a banner to those who fear Thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
19½Ã 60:5 That Thy beloved may be delivered, Save with Thy right hand, and answer us!
19½Ã 60:6 God has spoken in His holiness£º "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.
19½Ã 60:7 "Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
19½Ã 60:8 "Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me!"
19½Ã 60:9 Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19½Ã 60:10 Hast not Thou Thyself, O God, rejected us? And wilt Thou not go forth with our armies, O God?
19½Ã 60:11 O give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
19½Ã 60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly, And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
19½Ã 61:1 {For the choir director; on a stringed instrument. [A Psalm] of David.} Hear my cry, O God; Give heed to my prayer.
19½Ã 61:2 From the end of the earth I call to Thee, when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
19½Ã 61:3 For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy.
19½Ã 61:4 Let me dwell in Thy tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Thy wings. Selah.
19½Ã 61:5 For Thou hast heard my vows, O God; Thou hast given [me] the inheritance of those who fear Thy name.
19½Ã 61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life; His years will be as many generations.
19½Ã 61:7 He will abide before God forever; Appoint lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
19½Ã 61:8 So I will sing praise to Thy name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day.
19½Ã 62:1 {For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.} My soul [waits] in silence for God only; From Him is my salvation.
19½Ã 62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
19½Ã 62:3 How long will you assail a man, That you may murder [him,] all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
19½Ã 62:4 They have counseled only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah.
19½Ã 62:5 My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from Him.
19½Ã 62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
19½Ã 62:7 On God my salvation and my glory [rest]; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
19½Ã 62:8 Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.
19½Ã 62:9 Men of low degree are only vanity, and men of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up; They are together lighter than breath.
19½Ã 62:10 Do not trust in oppression, And do not vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, do not set [your] heart [upon them.]
19½Ã 62:11 Once God has spoken; Twice I have heard this£º That power belongs to God;
19½Ã 62:12 And lovingkindness is Thine, O Lord, For Thou dost recompense a man according to his work.
19½Ã 63:1 {A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.} O God, Thou art my God; I shall seek Thee earnestly; My soul thirsts for Thee, my flesh yearns for Thee, In a dry and weary land where there is no water.
19½Ã 63:2 Thus I have beheld Thee in the sanctuary, To see Thy power and Thy glory.
19½Ã 63:3 Because Thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips will praise Thee.
19½Ã 63:4 So I will bless Thee as long as I live; I will lift up my hands in Thy name.
19½Ã 63:5 My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth offers praises with joyful lips.
19½Ã 63:6 When I remember Thee on my bed, I meditate on Thee in the night watches,
19½Ã 63:7 For Thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing for joy.
19½Ã 63:8 My soul clings to Thee; Thy right hand upholds me.
19½Ã 63:9 But those who seek my life, to destroy it, Will go into the depths of the earth.
19½Ã 63:10 They will be delivered over to the power of the sword; They will be a prey for foxes.
19½Ã 63:11 But the king will rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him will glory, For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.
19½Ã 64:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
19½Ã 64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity,
19½Ã 64:3 Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech [as] their arrow,
19½Ã 64:4 To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear.
19½Ã 64:5 They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?"
19½Ã 64:6 They devise injustices, [saying,] "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.
19½Ã 64:7 But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.
19½Ã 64:8 So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head.
19½Ã 64:9 Then all men will fear, And will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done.
19½Ã 64:10 The righteous man will be glad in the LORD, and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory.
19½Ã 65:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David. A Song.} There will be silence before Thee, [and] praise in Zion, O God; And to Thee the vow will be performed.
19½Ã 65:2 O Thou who dost hear prayer, To Thee all men come.
19½Ã 65:3 Iniquities prevail against me; As for our transgressions, Thou dost forgive them.
19½Ã 65:4 How blessed is the one whom Thou dost choose, and bring near [to Thee], To dwell in Thy courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, Thy holy temple.
19½Ã 65:5 By awesome [deeds] Thou dost answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, Thou who art the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea;
19½Ã 65:6 Who dost establish the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;
19½Ã 65:7 Who dost still the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.
19½Ã 65:8 And they who dwell in the ends [of the earth] stand in awe of Thy signs; Thou dost make the dawn and the sunset shout for joy.
19½Ã 65:9 Thou dost visit the earth, and cause it to overflow; Thou dost greatly enrich it; The stream of God is full of water; Thou dost prepare their grain, for thus Thou dost prepare the earth.
19½Ã 65:10 Thou dost water its furrows abundantly; Thou dost settle its ridges; Thou dost soften it with showers; Thou dost bless its growth.
19½Ã 65:11 Thou hast crowned the year with Thy bounty, And Thy paths drip [with] fatness.
19½Ã 65:12 The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills gird themselves with rejoicing.
19½Ã 65:13 The meadows are clothed with flocks, And the valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy, yes, they sing.
19½Ã 66:1 {For the choir director. A Song. A Psalm.} Shout joyfully to God, all the earth;
19½Ã 66:2 Sing the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious.
19½Ã 66:3 Say to God, "How awesome are Thy works! Because of the greatness of Thy power Thine enemies will give feigned obedience to Thee.
19½Ã 66:4 "All the earth will worship Thee, And will sing praises to Thee; They will sing praises to Thy name." Selah.
19½Ã 66:5 Come and see the works of God, [Who is] awesome in [His] deeds toward the sons of men.
19½Ã 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land; They passed through the river on foot; There let us rejoice in Him!
19½Ã 66:7 He rules by His might forever; His eyes keep watch on the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
19½Ã 66:8 Bless our God, O peoples, And sound His praise abroad,
19½Ã 66:9 Who keeps us in life, And does not allow our feet to slip.
19½Ã 66:10 For Thou hast tried us, O God; Thou hast refined us as silver is refined.
19½Ã 66:11 Thou didst bring us into the net; Thou didst lay an oppressive burden upon our loins.
19½Ã 66:12 Thou didst make men ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; Yet Thou didst bring us out into [a place of] abundance.
19½Ã 66:13 I shall come into Thy house with burnt offerings; I shall pay Thee my vows,
19½Ã 66:14 Which my lips uttered And my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
19½Ã 66:15 I shall offer to Thee burnt offerings of fat beasts, With the smoke of rams; I shall make [an offering of] bulls with male goats. Selah.
19½Ã 66:16 Come [and] hear, all who fear God, And I will tell of what He has done for my soul.
19½Ã 66:17 I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue.
19½Ã 66:18 If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;
19½Ã 66:19 But certainly God has heard; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
19½Ã 66:20 Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His lovingkindness from me.
19½Ã 67:1 {For the choir director; with stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song.} God be gracious to us and bless us, [And] cause His face to shine upon us-- Selah.
19½Ã 67:2 That Thy way may be known on the earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
19½Ã 67:3 Let the peoples praise Thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise Thee.
19½Ã 67:4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For Thou wilt judge the peoples with uprightness, And guide the nations on the earth. Selah.
19½Ã 67:5 Let the peoples praise Thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise Thee.
19½Ã 67:6 The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us.
19½Ã 67:7 God blesses us, That all the ends of the earth may fear Him.
19½Ã 68:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David. A Song.} Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; And let those who hate Him flee before Him.
19½Ã 68:2 As smoke is driven away, [so] drive [them] away; As wax melts before the fire, [So] let the wicked perish before God.
19½Ã 68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God; Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
19½Ã 68:4 Sing to God, sing praises to His name; Lift up [a song] for Him who rides through the deserts, Whose name is the LORD, and exult before Him.
19½Ã 68:5 A father of the fatherless and a judge for the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.
19½Ã 68:6 God makes a home for the lonely; He leads out the prisoners into prosperity, Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
19½Ã 68:7 O God, when Thou didst go forth before Thy people, When Thou didst march through the wilderness, Selah.
19½Ã 68:8 The earth quaked; The heavens also dropped [rain] at the presence of God; Sinai itself [quaked] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
19½Ã 68:9 Thou didst shed abroad a plentiful rain, O God; Thou didst confirm Thine inheritance, when it was parched.
19½Ã 68:10 Thy creatures settled in it; Thou didst provide in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.
19½Ã 68:11 The Lord gives the command; The women who proclaim the [good] tidings are a great host£º
19½Ã 68:12 "Kings of armies flee, they flee, And she who remains at home will divide the spoil!"
19½Ã 68:13 When you lie down among the sheepfolds, [You are like] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And its pinions with glistening gold.
19½Ã 68:14 When the Almighty scattered the kings there, It was snowing in Zalmon.
19½Ã 68:15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A mountain [of many] peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
19½Ã 68:16 Why do you look with envy, O mountains with [many] peaks, At the mountain which God has desired for His abode? Surely, the LORD will dwell [ there] forever.
19½Ã 68:17 The chariots of God are myriads, thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them [as at] Sinai, in holiness.
19½Ã 68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captive [Thy] captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Even [among] the rebellious also, that the LORD God may dwell [there.]
19½Ã 68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, The God [who] is our salvation. Selah.
19½Ã 68:20 God is to us a God of deliverances; And to GOD the Lord belong escapes from death.
19½Ã 68:21 Surely God will shatter the head of His enemies, The hairy crown of him who goes on in his guilty deeds.
19½Ã 68:22 The Lord said, "I will bring [them] back from Bashan. I will bring [them] back from the depths of the sea;
19½Ã 68:23 That your foot may shatter [them] in blood, The tongue of your dogs [may have] its portion from [your] enemies. "
19½Ã 68:24 They have seen Thy procession, O God, The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
19½Ã 68:25 The singers went on, the musicians after [them], In the midst of the maidens beating tambourines.
19½Ã 68:26 Bless God in the congregations, [Even] the LORD, [you who are] of the fountain of Israel.
19½Ã 68:27 There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, The princes of Judah [in] their throng, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
19½Ã 68:28 Your God has commanded your strength; Show Thyself strong, O God, who hast acted on our behalf.
19½Ã 68:29 Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem Kings will bring gifts to Thee.
19½Ã 68:30 Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has scattered the peoples who delight in war.
19½Ã 68:31 Envoys will come out of Egypt; Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.
19½Ã 68:32 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; Sing praises to the Lord, Selah.
19½Ã 68:33 To Him who rides upon the highest heavens, which are from ancient times; Behold, He speaks forth with His voice, a mighty voice.
19½Ã 68:34 Ascribe strength to God; His majesty is over Israel, And His strength is in the skies.
19½Ã 68:35 O God, [Thou art] awesome from Thy sanctuary. The God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to the people. Blessed be God!
19½Ã 69:1 {For the choir director; according to Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.} Save me, O God, For the waters have threatened my life.
19½Ã 69:2 I have sunk in deep mire, and there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and a flood overflows me.
19½Ã 69:3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched; My eyes fail while I wait for my God.
19½Ã 69:4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; Those who would destroy me are powerful, being wrongfully my enemies, What I did not steal, I then have to restore.
19½Ã 69:5 O God, it is Thou who dost know my folly, And my wrongs are not hidden from Thee.
19½Ã 69:6 May those who wait for Thee not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; May those who seek Thee not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel,
19½Ã 69:7 Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; Dishonor has covered my face.
19½Ã 69:8 I have become estranged from my brothers, And an alien to my mother's sons.
19½Ã 69:9 For zeal for Thy house has consumed me, And the reproaches of those who reproach Thee have fallen on me.
19½Ã 69:10 When I wept in my soul with fasting, It became my reproach.
19½Ã 69:11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
19½Ã 69:12 Those who sit in the gate talk about me, And I [am] the song of the drunkards.
19½Ã 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is to Thee, O LORD, at an acceptable time; O God, in the greatness of Thy lovingkindness, Answer me with Thy saving truth.
19½Ã 69:14 Deliver me from the mire, and do not let me sink; May I be delivered from my foes, and from the deep waters.
19½Ã 69:15 May the flood of water not overflow me, And may the deep not swallow me up, And may the pit not shut its mouth on me.
19½Ã 69:16 Answer me, O LORD, for Thy lovingkindness is good; According to the greatness of Thy compassion, turn to me,
19½Ã 69:17 And do not hide Thy face from Thy servant, For I am in distress; answer me quickly.
19½Ã 69:18 Oh draw near to my soul [and] redeem it; Ransom me because of my enemies!
19½Ã 69:19 Thou dost know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor; All my adversaries are before Thee.
19½Ã 69:20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am so sick. And I looked for sympathy, but there was none, And for comforters, but I found none.
19½Ã 69:21 They also gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
19½Ã 69:22 May their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, [may it become] a trap.
19½Ã 69:23 May their eyes grow dim so that they cannot see, And make their loins shake continually.
19½Ã 69:24 Pour out Thine indignation on them, And may Thy burning anger overtake them.
19½Ã 69:25 May their camp be desolate; May none dwell in their tents.
19½Ã 69:26 For they have persecuted him whom Thou Thyself hast smitten, And they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded.
19½Ã 69:27 Do Thou add iniquity to their iniquity, And may they not come into Thy righteousness.
19½Ã 69:28 May they be blotted out of the book of life, And may they not be recorded with the righteous.
19½Ã 69:29 But I am afflicted and in pain; May Thy salvation, O God, set me [securely] on high.
19½Ã 69:30 I will praise the name of God with song, And shall magnify Him with thanksgiving.
19½Ã 69:31 And it will please the LORD better than an ox [Or] a young bull with horns and hoofs.
19½Ã 69:32 The humble have seen [it and] are glad; You who seek God, let your heart revive.
19½Ã 69:33 For the LORD hears the needy, And does not despise His [who are] prisoners.
19½Ã 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them.
19½Ã 69:35 For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell there and possess it.
19½Ã 69:36 And the descendants of His servants will inherit it, And those who love His name will dwell in it.
19½Ã 70:1 {For the choir director. [A Psalm] of David; for a memorial.} O God, [hasten] to deliver me; O LORD, hasten to my help!
19½Ã 70:2 Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.
19½Ã 70:3 Let those be turned back because of their shame Who say, "Aha, aha!"
19½Ã 70:4 Let all who seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; And let those who love Thy salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified."
19½Ã 70:5 But I am afflicted and needy; Hasten to me, O God! Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
19½Ã 71:1 In Thee, O LORD, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.
19½Ã 71:2 In Thy righteousness deliver me, and rescue me; Incline Thine ear to me, and save me.
19½Ã 71:3 Be Thou to me a rock of habitation, to which I may continually come; Thou hast given commandment to save me, For Thou art my rock and my fortress.
19½Ã 71:4 Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the grasp of the wrongdoer and ruthless man,
19½Ã 71:5 For Thou art my hope; O Lord GOD, [Thou art] my confidence from my youth.
19½Ã 71:6 By Thee I have been sustained from [my] birth; Thou art He who took me from my mother's womb; My praise is continually of Thee.
19½Ã 71:7 I have become a marvel to many; For Thou art my strong refuge.
19½Ã 71:8 My mouth is filled with Thy praise, And with Thy glory all day long.
19½Ã 71:9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age; Do not forsake me when my strength fails.
19½Ã 71:10 For my enemies have spoken against me; And those who watch for my life have consulted together,
19½Ã 71:11 Saying, "God has forsaken him; Pursue and seize him, for there is no one to deliver."
19½Ã 71:12 O God, do not be far from me; O my God, hasten to my help!
19½Ã 71:13 Let those who are adversaries of my soul be ashamed [and] consumed; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek to injure me.
19½Ã 71:14 But as for me, I will hope continually, And will praise Thee yet more and more.
19½Ã 71:15 My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness, [And] of Thy salvation all day long; For I do not know the sum [of them.]
19½Ã 71:16 I will come with the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD; I will make mention of Thy righteousness, Thine alone.
19½Ã 71:17 O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; And I still declare Thy wondrous deeds.
19½Ã 71:18 And even when [I am] old and gray, O God, do not forsake me, Until I declare Thy strength to [this] generation, Thy power to all who are to come.
19½Ã 71:19 For Thy righteousness, O God, [reaches] to the heavens, Thou who hast done great things; O God, who is like Thee?
19½Ã 71:20 Thou, who hast shown me many troubles and distresses, Wilt revive me again, And wilt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
19½Ã 71:21 Mayest Thou increase my greatness, And turn [to] comfort me.
19½Ã 71:22 I will also praise Thee with a harp, [Even] Thy truth, O my God; To Thee I will sing praises with the lyre, O Thou Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 71:23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to Thee; And my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.
19½Ã 71:24 My tongue also will utter Thy righteousness all day long; For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my hurt.
19½Ã 72:1 {[A Psalm] of Solomon.} Give the king Thy judgments, O God, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.
19½Ã 72:2 May he judge Thy people with righteousness, And Thine afflicted with justice.
19½Ã 72:3 Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills in righteousness.
19½Ã 72:4 May he vindicate the afflicted of the people, Save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.
19½Ã 72:5 Let them fear Thee while the sun [endures], And as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
19½Ã 72:6 May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers that water the earth.
19½Ã 72:7 In his days may the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
19½Ã 72:8 May he also rule from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
19½Ã 72:9 Let the nomads of the desert bow before him; And his enemies lick the dust.
19½Ã 72:10 Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
19½Ã 72:11 And let all kings bow down before him, All nations serve him.
19½Ã 72:12 For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help, The afflicted also, and him who has no helper.
19½Ã 72:13 He will have compassion on the poor and needy, And the lives of the needy he will save.
19½Ã 72:14 He will rescue their life from oppression and violence; And their blood will be precious in his sight;
19½Ã 72:15 So may he live; and may the gold of Sheba be given to him; And let them pray for him continually; Let them bless him all day long.
19½Ã 72:16 May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the mountains; Its fruit will wave like [the cedars of] Lebanon; And may those from the city flourish like vegetation of the earth.
19½Ã 72:17 May his name endure forever; May his name increase as long as the sun [shines]; And let [men] bless themselves by him; Let all nations call him blessed.
19½Ã 72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, Who alone works wonders.
19½Ã 72:19 And blessed be His glorious name forever; And may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.
19½Ã 72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
19½Ã 73:1 {A Psalm of Asaph.} Surely God is good to Israel, To those who are pure in heart!
19½Ã 73:2 But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling; My steps had almost slipped.
19½Ã 73:3 For I was envious of the arrogant, [As] I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19½Ã 73:4 For there are no pains in their death; And their body is fat.
19½Ã 73:5 They are not in trouble [as other] men; Nor are they plagued like mankind.
19½Ã 73:6 Therefore pride is their necklace; The garment of violence covers them.
19½Ã 73:7 Their eye bulges from fatness; The imaginations of [their] heart run riot.
19½Ã 73:8 They mock, and wickedly speak of oppression; They speak from on high.
19½Ã 73:9 They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue parades through the earth.
19½Ã 73:10 Therefore his people return to this place; And waters of abundance are drunk by them.
19½Ã 73:11 And they say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge with the Most High?"
19½Ã 73:12 Behold, these are the wicked; And always at ease, they have increased [in] wealth.
19½Ã 73:13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure, And washed my hands in innocence;
19½Ã 73:14 For I have been stricken all day long, And chastened every morning.
19½Ã 73:15 If I had said, "I will speak thus," Behold, I should have betrayed the generation of Thy children.
19½Ã 73:16 When I pondered to understand this, It was troublesome in my sight
19½Ã 73:17 Until I came into the sanctuary of God; [Then] I perceived their end.
19½Ã 73:18 Surely Thou dost set them in slippery places; Thou dost cast them down to destruction.
19½Ã 73:19 How they are destroyed in a moment! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors!
19½Ã 73:20 Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when aroused, Thou wilt despise their form.
19½Ã 73:21 When my heart was embittered, And I was pierced within,
19½Ã 73:22 Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was [like] a beast before Thee.
19½Ã 73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou hast taken hold of my right hand.
19½Ã 73:24 With Thy counsel Thou wilt guide me, And afterward receive me to glory.
19½Ã 73:25 Whom have I in heaven [but Thee]? And besides Thee, I desire nothing on earth.
19½Ã 73:26 My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19½Ã 73:27 For, behold, those who are far from Thee will perish; Thou hast destroyed all those who are unfaithful to Thee.
19½Ã 73:28 But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, That I may tell of all Thy works.
19½Ã 74:1 {A Maskil of Asaph.} O God, why hast Thou rejected [us] forever? Why does Thine anger smoke against the sheep of Thy pasture?
19½Ã 74:2 Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast purchased of old, Which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance; [And] this Mount Zion, where Thou hast dwelt.
19½Ã 74:3 Turn Thy footsteps toward the perpetual ruins; The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary.
19½Ã 74:4 Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting place; They have set up their own standards for signs.
19½Ã 74:5 It seems as if one had lifted up [His] axe in a forest of trees.
19½Ã 74:6 And now all its carved work They smash with hatchet and hammers.
19½Ã 74:7 They have burned Thy sanctuary to the ground; They have defiled the dwelling place of Thy name.
19½Ã 74:8 They said in their heart, "Let us completely subdue them." They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
19½Ã 74:9 We do not see our signs; There is no longer any prophet, Nor is there any among us who knows how long.
19½Ã 74:10 How long, O God, will the adversary revile, [And] the enemy spurn Thy name forever?
19½Ã 74:11 Why dost Thou withdraw Thy hand, even Thy right hand? From within Thy bosom, destroy [them]!
19½Ã 74:12 Yet God is my king from of old, Who works deeds of deliverance in the midst of the earth.
19½Ã 74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by Thy strength; Thou didst break the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
19½Ã 74:14 Thou didst crush the heads of Leviathan; Thou didst give him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
19½Ã 74:15 Thou didst break open springs and torrents; Thou didst dry up ever-flowing streams.
19½Ã 74:16 Thine is the day, Thine also is the night; Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
19½Ã 74:17 Thou hast established all the boundaries of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.
19½Ã 74:18 Remember this, O LORD, that the enemy has reviled; And a foolish people has spurned Thy name.
19½Ã 74:19 Do not deliver the soul of Thy turtledove to the wild beast; Do not forget the life of Thine afflicted forever.
19½Ã 74:20 Consider the covenant; For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
19½Ã 74:21 Let not the oppressed return dishonored; Let the afflicted and needy praise Thy name.
19½Ã 74:22 Do arise, O God, [and] plead Thine own cause; Remember how the foolish man reproaches Thee all day long.
19½Ã 74:23 Do not forget the voice of Thine adversaries, The uproar of those who rise against Thee which ascends continually.
19½Ã 75:1 {For the choir director; [set to] Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.} We give thanks to Thee, O God, we give thanks, For Thy name is near; Men declare Thy wondrous works.
19½Ã 75:2 "When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity.
19½Ã 75:3 "The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah.
19½Ã 75:4 "I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn;
19½Ã 75:5 Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride. ' "
19½Ã 75:6 For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert [comes] exaltation;
19½Ã 75:7 But God is the Judge; He puts down one, and exalts another.
19½Ã 75:8 For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain [and] drink down its dregs.
19½Ã 75:9 But as for me, I will declare [it] forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 75:10 And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, [But] the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
19½Ã 76:1 {For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.} God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
19½Ã 76:2 And His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion.
19½Ã 76:3 There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
19½Ã 76:4 Thou art resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey.
19½Ã 76:5 The stouthearted were plundered; They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands.
19½Ã 76:6 At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep.
19½Ã 76:7 Thou, even Thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in Thy presence when once Thou art angry?
19½Ã 76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
19½Ã 76:9 When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.
19½Ã 76:10 For the wrath of man shall praise Thee; With a remnant of wrath Thou shalt gird Thyself.
19½Ã 76:11 Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill [them]; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared.
19½Ã 76:12 He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
19½Ã 77:1 {For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.} My voice [rises] to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice [rises] to God, and He will hear me.
19½Ã 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted.
19½Ã 77:3 [When] I remember God, then I am disturbed; [When] I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah.
19½Ã 77:4 Thou hast held my eyelids [open]; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
19½Ã 77:5 I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.
19½Ã 77:6 I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart; And my spirit ponders.
19½Ã 77:7 Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again?
19½Ã 77:8 Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has [His] promise come to an end forever?
19½Ã 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.
19½Ã 77:10 Then I said, "It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed."
19½Ã 77:11 I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; Surely I will remember Thy wonders of old.
19½Ã 77:12 I will meditate on all Thy work, And muse on Thy deeds.
19½Ã 77:13 Thy way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?
19½Ã 77:14 Thou art the God who workest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.
19½Ã 77:15 Thou hast by Thy power redeemed Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
19½Ã 77:16 The waters saw Thee, O God; The waters saw Thee, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled.
19½Ã 77:17 The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Thy arrows flashed here and there.
19½Ã 77:18 The sound of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
19½Ã 77:19 Thy way was in the sea, And Thy paths in the mighty waters, And Thy footprints may not be known.
19½Ã 77:20 Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19½Ã 78:1 {A Maskil of Asaph.} Listen, O my people, to my instruction; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
19½Ã 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,
19½Ã 78:3 Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.
19½Ã 78:4 We will not conceal them from their children, But tell to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, And His strength and His wondrous works that He has done.
19½Ã 78:5 For He established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers, That they should teach them to their children,
19½Ã 78:6 That the generation to come might know, [even] the children [yet] to be born, [That] they may arise and tell [them] to their children,
19½Ã 78:7 That they should put their confidence in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments,
19½Ã 78:8 And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not prepare its heart, And whose spirit was not faithful to God.
19½Ã 78:9 The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows, [Yet] they turned back in the day of battle.
19½Ã 78:10 They did not keep the covenant of God, And refused to walk in His law;
19½Ã 78:11 And they forgot His deeds, And His miracles that He had shown them.
19½Ã 78:12 He wrought wonders before their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
19½Ã 78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; And He made the waters stand up like a heap.
19½Ã 78:14 Then He led them with the cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.
19½Ã 78:15 He split the rocks in the wilderness, And gave [them] abundant drink like the ocean depths.
19½Ã 78:16 He brought forth streams also from the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.
19½Ã 78:17 Yet they still continued to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
19½Ã 78:18 And in their heart they put God to the test By asking food according to their desire.
19½Ã 78:19 Then they spoke against God; They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
19½Ã 78:20 "Behold, He struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?"
19½Ã 78:21 Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath, And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also mounted against Israel;
19½Ã 78:22 Because they did not believe in God, And did not trust in His salvation.
19½Ã 78:23 Yet He commanded the clouds above, And opened the doors of heaven;
19½Ã 78:24 And He rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.
19½Ã 78:25 Man did eat the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.
19½Ã 78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by His power He directed the south wind.
19½Ã 78:27 When He rained meat upon them like the dust, Even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,
19½Ã 78:28 Then He let [them] fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their dwellings.
19½Ã 78:29 So they ate and were well filled; And their desire He gave to them.
19½Ã 78:30 Before they had satisfied their desire, While their food was in their mouths,
19½Ã 78:31 The anger of God rose against them, And killed some of their stoutest ones, And subdued the choice men of Israel.
19½Ã 78:32 In spite of all this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wonderful works.
19½Ã 78:33 So He brought their days to an end in futility, And their years in sudden terror.
19½Ã 78:34 When He killed them, then they sought Him, And returned and searched diligently for God;
19½Ã 78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer.
19½Ã 78:36 But they deceived Him with their mouth, And lied to Him with their tongue.
19½Ã 78:37 For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant.
19½Ã 78:38 But He, being compassionate, forgave [their] iniquity, and did not destroy [them]; And often He restrained His anger, And did not arouse all His wrath.
19½Ã 78:39 Thus He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passes and does not return.
19½Ã 78:40 How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness, And grieved Him in the desert!
19½Ã 78:41 And again and again they tempted God, And pained the Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 78:42 They did not remember His power, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,
19½Ã 78:43 When He performed His signs in Egypt, And His marvels in the field of Zoan,
19½Ã 78:44 And turned their rivers to blood, And their streams, they could not drink.
19½Ã 78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them.
19½Ã 78:46 He gave also their crops to the grasshopper, And the product of their labor to the locust.
19½Ã 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, And their sycamore trees with frost.
19½Ã 78:48 He gave over their cattle also to the hailstones, And their herds to bolts of lightning.
19½Ã 78:49 He sent upon them His burning anger, Fury, and indignation, and trouble, A band of destroying angels.
19½Ã 78:50 He leveled a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave over their life to the plague,
19½Ã 78:51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The first [issue] of their virility in the tents of Ham.
19½Ã 78:52 But He led forth His own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
19½Ã 78:53 And He led them safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea engulfed their enemies.
19½Ã 78:54 So He brought them to His holy land, To this hill country which His right hand had gained.
19½Ã 78:55 He also drove out the nations before them, And He apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
19½Ã 78:56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And did not keep His testimonies,
19½Ã 78:57 But turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; They turned aside like a treacherous bow.
19½Ã 78:58 For they provoked Him with their high places, And aroused His jealousy with their graven images.
19½Ã 78:59 When God heard, He was filled with wrath, And greatly abhorred Israel;
19½Ã 78:60 So that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, The tent which He had pitched among men,
19½Ã 78:61 And gave up His strength to captivity, And His glory into the hand of the adversary.
19½Ã 78:62 He also delivered His people to the sword, And was filled with wrath at His inheritance.
19½Ã 78:63 Fire devoured His young men; And His virgins had no wedding songs.
19½Ã 78:64 His priests fell by the sword; And His widows could not weep.
19½Ã 78:65 Then the Lord awoke as [if from] sleep, Like a warrior overcome by wine.
19½Ã 78:66 And He drove His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting reproach.
19½Ã 78:67 He also rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
19½Ã 78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.
19½Ã 78:69 And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has founded forever.
19½Ã 78:70 He also chose David His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;
19½Ã 78:71 From the care of the ewes with suckling lambs He brought him, To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance.
19½Ã 78:72 So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them with his skillful hands.
19½Ã 79:1 {A Psalm of Asaph.} O God, the nations have invaded Thine inheritance; They have defiled Thy holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
19½Ã 79:2 They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants for food to the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Thy godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
19½Ã 79:3 They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them.
19½Ã 79:4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to those around us.
19½Ã 79:5 How long, O LORD? Wilt Thou be angry forever? Will Thy jealousy burn like fire?
19½Ã 79:6 Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations which do not know Thee, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Thy name.
19½Ã 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.
19½Ã 79:8 Do not remember the iniquities of [our] forefathers against us; Let Thy compassion come quickly to meet us; For we are brought very low.
19½Ã 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.
19½Ã 79:10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let there be known among the nations in our sight, Vengeance for the blood of Thy servants, which has been shed.
19½Ã 79:11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; According to the greatness of Thy power preserve those who are doomed to die.
19½Ã 79:12 And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom The reproach with which they have reproached Thee, O Lord.
19½Ã 79:13 So we Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture Will give thanks to Thee forever; To all generations we will tell of Thy praise.
19½Ã 80:1 {For the choir director; [set to] El Shoshannim; Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.} Oh, give ear, Shepherd of Israel, Thou who dost lead Joseph like a flock; Thou who art enthroned [above] the cherubim, shine forth!
19½Ã 80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy power, And come to save us!
19½Ã 80:3 O God, restore us, And cause Thy face to shine [upon us], and we will be saved.
19½Ã 80:4 O LORD God [of] hosts, How long wilt Thou be angry with the prayer of Thy people?
19½Ã 80:5 Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And Thou hast made them to drink tears in large measure.
19½Ã 80:6 Thou dost make us an object of contention to our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.
19½Ã 80:7 O God [of] hosts, restore us, And cause Thy face to shine [upon us,] and we will be saved.
19½Ã 80:8 Thou didst remove a vine from Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.
19½Ã 80:9 Thou didst clear [the ground] before it, And it took deep root and filled the land.
19½Ã 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shadow; And the cedars of God with its boughs.
19½Ã 80:11 It was sending out its branches to the sea, And its shoots to the River.
19½Ã 80:12 Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, So that all who pass [that] way pick its [fruit]?
19½Ã 80:13 A boar from the forest eats it away, And whatever moves in the field feeds on it.
19½Ã 80:14 O God [of] hosts, turn again now, we beseech Thee; Look down from heaven and see, and take care of this vine,
19½Ã 80:15 Even the shoot which Thy right hand has planted, And on the son whom Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.
19½Ã 80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.
19½Ã 80:17 Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom Thou didst make strong for Thyself.
19½Ã 80:18 Then we shall not turn back from Thee; Revive us, and we will call upon Thy name.
19½Ã 80:19 O LORD God of hosts, restore us; Cause Thy face to shine [upon us,] and we will be saved.
19½Ã 81:1 {For the choir director; on the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph.} Sing for joy to God our strength; Shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 81:2 Raise a song, strike the timbrel, The sweet sounding lyre with the harp.
19½Ã 81:3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast day.
19½Ã 81:4 For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
19½Ã 81:5 He established it for a testimony in Joseph, When he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not know£º
19½Ã 81:6 "I relieved his shoulder of the burden, His hands were freed from the basket.
19½Ã 81:7 "You called in trouble, and I rescued you; I answered you in the hiding place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
19½Ã 81:8 "Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would listen to Me!
19½Ã 81:9 "Let there be no strange god among you; Nor shall you worship any foreign god.
19½Ã 81:10 "I, the LORD, am your God, Who brought you up from the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
19½Ã 81:11 "But My people did not listen to My voice; And Israel did not obey Me.
19½Ã 81:12 "So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart, To walk in their own devices.
19½Ã 81:13 "Oh that My people would listen to Me, That Israel would walk in My ways!
19½Ã 81:14 "I would quickly subdue their enemies, And turn My hand against their adversaries.
19½Ã 81:15 "Those who hate the LORD would pretend obedience to Him; And their time [of punishment] would be forever.
19½Ã 81:16 "But I would feed you with the finest of the wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you."
19½Ã 82:1 {A Psalm of Asaph.} God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers.
19½Ã 82:2 How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.
19½Ã 82:3 Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
19½Ã 82:4 Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver [them] out of the hand of the wicked.
19½Ã 82:5 They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
19½Ã 82:6 I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High.
19½Ã 82:7 "Nevertheless you will die like men, And fall like [any] one of the princes."
19½Ã 82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is Thou who dost possess all the nations.
19½Ã 83:1 {A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.} O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.
19½Ã 83:2 For, behold, Thine enemies make an uproar; And those who hate Thee have exalted themselves.
19½Ã 83:3 They make shrewd plans against Thy people, And conspire together against Thy treasured ones.
19½Ã 83:4 They have said, "Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation, That the name of Israel be remembered no more."
19½Ã 83:5 For they have conspired together with one mind; Against Thee do they make a covenant£º
19½Ã 83:6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
19½Ã 83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
19½Ã 83:8 Assyria also has joined with them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah.
19½Ã 83:9 Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera [and] Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
19½Ã 83:10 Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became as dung for the ground.
19½Ã 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, And all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
19½Ã 83:12 Who said, "Let us possess for ourselves The pastures of God."
19½Ã 83:13 O my God, make them like the whirling dust; Like chaff before the wind.
19½Ã 83:14 Like fire that burns the forest, And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,
19½Ã 83:15 So pursue them with Thy tempest, And terrify them with Thy storm.
19½Ã 83:16 Fill their faces with dishonor, That they may seek Thy name, O LORD.
19½Ã 83:17 Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever; And let them be humiliated and perish,
19½Ã 83:18 That they may know that Thou alone, whose name is the LORD, Art the Most High over all the earth.
19½Ã 84:1 {For the choir director; on the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.} How lovely are Thy dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!
19½Ã 84:2 My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.
19½Ã 84:3 The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even Thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God.
19½Ã 84:4 How blessed are those who dwell in Thy house! They are ever praising Thee. Selah.
19½Ã 84:5 How blessed is the man whose strength is in Thee; In whose heart are the highways [to Zion]!
19½Ã 84:6 Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a spring, The early rain also covers it with blessings.
19½Ã 84:7 They go from strength to strength, [Every one of them] appears before God in Zion.
19½Ã 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah.
19½Ã 84:9 Behold our shield, O God, And look upon the face of Thine anointed.
19½Ã 84:10 For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand [outside.] I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
19½Ã 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
19½Ã 84:12 O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in Thee!
19½Ã 85:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.} O LORD, Thou didst show favor to Thy land; Thou didst restore the captivity of Jacob.
19½Ã 85:2 Thou didst forgive the iniquity of Thy people; Thou didst cover all their sin. Selah.
19½Ã 85:3 Thou didst withdraw all Thy fury; Thou didst turn away from Thy burning anger.
19½Ã 85:4 Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Thine indignation toward us to cease.
19½Ã 85:5 Wilt Thou be angry with us forever? Wilt Thou prolong Thine anger to all generations?
19½Ã 85:6 Wilt Thou not Thyself revive us again, That Thy people may rejoice in Thee?
19½Ã 85:7 Show us Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, And grant us Thy salvation.
19½Ã 85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will say; For He will speak peace to His people, to His godly ones; But let them not turn back to folly.
19½Ã 85:9 Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land.
19½Ã 85:10 Lovingkindness and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
19½Ã 85:11 Truth springs from the earth; And righteousness looks down from heaven.
19½Ã 85:12 Indeed, the LORD will give what is good; And our land will yield its produce.
19½Ã 85:13 Righteousness will go before Him, And will make His footsteps into a way.
19½Ã 86:1 {A Prayer of David.} Incline Thine ear, O LORD, [and] answer me; For I am afflicted and needy.
19½Ã 86:2 Do preserve my soul, for I am a godly man; O Thou my God, save Thy servant who trusts in Thee.
19½Ã 86:3 Be gracious to me, O Lord, For to Thee I cry all day long.
19½Ã 86:4 Make glad the soul of Thy servant, For to Thee, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 86:5 For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon Thee.
19½Ã 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; And give heed to the voice of my supplications!
19½Ã 86:7 In the day of my trouble I shall call upon Thee, For Thou wilt answer me.
19½Ã 86:8 There is no one like Thee among the gods, O Lord; Nor are there any works like Thine.
19½Ã 86:9 All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify Thy name.
19½Ã 86:10 For Thou art great and doest wondrous deeds; Thou alone art God.
19½Ã 86:11 Teach me Thy way, O LORD; I will walk in Thy truth; Unite my heart to fear Thy name.
19½Ã 86:12 I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And will glorify Thy name forever.
19½Ã 86:13 For Thy lovingkindness toward me is great, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
19½Ã 86:14 O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a band of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set Thee before them.
19½Ã 86:15 But Thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
19½Ã 86:16 Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Oh grant Thy strength to Thy servant, And save the son of Thy handmaid.
19½Ã 86:17 Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see [it], and be ashamed, Because Thou, O LORD, hast helped me and comforted me.
19½Ã 87:1 {A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A Song.} His foundation is in the holy mountains.
19½Ã 87:2 The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the [other] dwelling places of Jacob.
19½Ã 87:3 Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah.
19½Ã 87:4 "I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia£º 'This one was born there.'"
19½Ã 87:5 But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her.
19½Ã 87:6 The LORD shall count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.
19½Ã 87:7 Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes [shall say], "All my springs [of joy] are in you."
19½Ã 88:1 {A Song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director; according to} (Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.) O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried out by day and in the night before Thee.
19½Ã 88:2 Let my prayer come before Thee; Incline Thine ear to my cry!
19½Ã 88:3 For my soul has had enough troubles, And my life has drawn near to Sheol.
19½Ã 88:4 I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit; I have become like a man without strength,
19½Ã 88:5 Forsaken among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom Thou dost remember no more, And they are cut off from Thy hand.
19½Ã 88:6 Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.
19½Ã 88:7 Thy wrath has rested upon me, And Thou hast afflicted me with all Thy waves. Selah.
19½Ã 88:8 Thou hast removed my acquaintances far from me; Thou hast made me an object of loathing to them; I am shut up and cannot go out.
19½Ã 88:9 My eye has wasted away because of affliction; I have called upon Thee every day, O LORD; I have spread out my hands to Thee.
19½Ã 88:10 Wilt Thou perform wonders for the dead? Will the departed spirits rise [and] praise Thee? Selah.
19½Ã 88:11 Will Thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave, Thy faithfulness in Abaddon?
19½Ã 88:12 Will Thy wonders be made known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
19½Ã 88:13 But I, O LORD, have cried out to Thee for help, And in the morning my prayer comes before Thee.
19½Ã 88:14 O LORD, why dost Thou reject my soul? [Why] dost Thou hide Thy face from me?
19½Ã 88:15 I was afflicted and about to die from my youth on; I suffer Thy terrors; I am overcome.
19½Ã 88:16 Thy burning anger has passed over me; Thy terrors have destroyed me.
19½Ã 88:17 They have surrounded me like water all day long; They have encompassed me altogether.
19½Ã 88:18 Thou hast removed lover and friend far from me; My acquaintances are [in] darkness.
19½Ã 89:1 {A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.} I will sing of the lovingkindness of the LORD forever; To all generations I will make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth.
19½Ã 89:2 For I have said, "Lovingkindness will be built up forever; In the heavens Thou wilt establish Thy faithfulness."
19½Ã 89:3 "I have made a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn to David My servant,
19½Ã 89:4 I will establish your seed forever, And build up your throne to all generations. "Selah.
19½Ã 89:5 And the heavens will praise Thy wonders, O LORD; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
19½Ã 89:6 For who in the skies is comparable to the LORD? Who among the sons of the mighty is like the LORD,
19½Ã 89:7 A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, And awesome above all those who are around Him?
19½Ã 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is like Thee, O mighty LORD? Thy faithfulness also surrounds Thee.
19½Ã 89:9 Thou dost rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, Thou dost still them.
19½Ã 89:10 Thou Thyself didst crush Rahab like one who is slain; Thou didst scatter Thine enemies with Thy mighty arm.
19½Ã 89:11 The heavens are Thine, the earth also is Thine; The world and all it contains, Thou hast founded them.
19½Ã 89:12 The north and the south, Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Thy name.
19½Ã 89:13 Thou hast a strong arm; Thy hand is mighty, Thy right hand is exalted.
19½Ã 89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Thy throne; Lovingkindness and truth go before Thee.
19½Ã 89:15 How blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! O LORD, they walk in the light of Thy countenance.
19½Ã 89:16 In Thy name they rejoice all the day, And by Thy righteousness they are exalted.
19½Ã 89:17 For Thou art the glory of their strength, And by Thy favor our horn is exalted.
19½Ã 89:18 For our shield belongs to the LORD, And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
19½Ã 89:19 Once Thou didst speak in vision to Thy godly ones, And didst say, "I have given help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
19½Ã 89:20 "I have found David My servant; With My holy oil I have anointed him,
19½Ã 89:21 With whom My hand will be established; My arm also will strengthen him.
19½Ã 89:22 "The enemy will not deceive him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
19½Ã 89:23 "But I shall crush his adversaries before him, And strike those who hate him.
19½Ã 89:24 "And My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with him, And in My name his horn will be exalted.
19½Ã 89:25 "I shall also set his hand on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.
19½Ã 89:26 "He will cry to Me, 'Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'
19½Ã 89:27 "I also shall make him [My] first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.
19½Ã 89:28 "My lovingkindness I will keep for him forever, And My covenant shall be confirmed to him.
19½Ã 89:29 "So I will establish his descendants forever, And his throne as the days of heaven.
19½Ã 89:30 "If his sons forsake My law, And do not walk in My judgments,
19½Ã 89:31 If they violate My statutes, And do not keep My commandments,
19½Ã 89:32 Then I will visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.
19½Ã 89:33 "But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him, Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.
19½Ã 89:34 "My covenant I will not violate, Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips.
19½Ã 89:35 "Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David.
19½Ã 89:36 "His descendants shall endure forever, And his throne as the sun before Me.
19½Ã 89:37 "It shall be established forever like the moon, And the witness in the sky is faithful." Selah.
19½Ã 89:38 But Thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been full of wrath against Thine anointed.
19½Ã 89:39 Thou hast spurned the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned his crown in the dust.
19½Ã 89:40 Thou hast broken down all his walls; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
19½Ã 89:41 All who pass along the way plunder him; He has become a reproach to his neighbors.
19½Ã 89:42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies rejoice.
19½Ã 89:43 Thou dost also turn back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him stand in battle.
19½Ã 89:44 Thou hast made his splendor to cease, And cast his throne to the ground.
19½Ã 89:45 Thou hast shortened the days of his youth; Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
19½Ã 89:46 How long, O LORD? Wilt Thou hide Thyself forever? Will Thy wrath burn like fire?
19½Ã 89:47 Remember what my span of life is; For what vanity Thou hast created all the sons of men!
19½Ã 89:48 What man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.
19½Ã 89:49 Where are Thy former lovingkindnesses, O Lord, Which Thou didst swear to David in Thy faithfulness?
19½Ã 89:50 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] all the many peoples,
19½Ã 89:51 With which Thine enemies have reproached, O LORD, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Thine anointed.
19½Ã 89:52 Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.
19½Ã 90:1 {A Prayer of Moses the man of God.} Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
19½Ã 90:2 Before the mountains were born, Or Thou didst give birth to the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.
19½Ã 90:3 Thou dost turn man back into dust, And dost say, "Return, O children of men."
19½Ã 90:4 For a thousand years in Thy sight Are like yesterday when it passes by, Or [as] a watch in the night.
19½Ã 90:5 Thou hast swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep; In the morning they are like grass which sprouts anew.
19½Ã 90:6 In the morning it flourishes, and sprouts anew; Toward evening it fades, and withers away.
19½Ã 90:7 For we have been consumed by Thine anger, And by Thy wrath we have been dismayed.
19½Ã 90:8 Thou hast placed our iniquities before Thee, Our secret [sins] in the light of Thy presence.
19½Ã 90:9 For all our days have declined in Thy fury; We have finished our years like a sigh.
19½Ã 90:10 As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is [but] labor and sorrow; For soon it is gone and we fly away.
19½Ã 90:11 Who understands the power of Thine anger, And Thy fury, according to the fear that is due Thee?
19½Ã 90:12 So teach us to number our days, That we may present to Thee a heart of wisdom.
19½Ã 90:13 Do return, O LORD; how long [will it be]? And be sorry for Thy servants.
19½Ã 90:14 O satisfy us in the morning with Thy lovingkindness, That we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
19½Ã 90:15 Make us glad according to the days Thou hast afflicted us, [And] the years we have seen evil.
19½Ã 90:16 Let Thy work appear to Thy servants, And Thy majesty to their children.
19½Ã 90:17 And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And do confirm for us the work of our hands; Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
19½Ã 91:1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
19½Ã 91:2 I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust!"
19½Ã 91:3 For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper, And from the deadly pestilence.
19½Ã 91:4 He will cover you with His pinions, And under His wings you may seek refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.
19½Ã 91:5 You will not be afraid of the terror by night, Or of the arrow that flies by day;
19½Ã 91:6 Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.
19½Ã 91:7 A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; [But] it shall not approach you.
19½Ã 91:8 You will only look on with your eyes, And see the recompense of the wicked.
19½Ã 91:9 For you have made the LORD, my refuge, [Even] the Most High, your dwelling place.
19½Ã 91:10 No evil will befall you, Nor will any plague come near your tent.
19½Ã 91:11 For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.
19½Ã 91:12 They will bear you up in their hands, Lest you strike your foot against a stone.
19½Ã 91:13 You will tread upon the lion and cobra, The young lion and the serpent you will trample down.
19½Ã 91:14 "Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him [securely] on high, because he has known My name.
19½Ã 91:15 "He will call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him, and honor him.
19½Ã 91:16 "With a long life I will satisfy him, And let him behold My salvation."
19½Ã 92:1 {A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath day.} It is good to give thanks to the LORD, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High;
19½Ã 92:2 To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, And Thy faithfulness by night,
19½Ã 92:3 With the ten-stringed lute, and with the harp; With resounding music upon the lyre.
19½Ã 92:4 For Thou, O LORD, hast made me glad by what Thou hast done, I will sing for joy at the works of Thy hands.
19½Ã 92:5 How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep.
19½Ã 92:6 A senseless man has no knowledge; Nor does a stupid man understand this£º
19½Ã 92:7 That when the wicked sprouted up like grass, And all who did iniquity flourished, It [was only] that they might be destroyed forevermore.
19½Ã 92:8 But Thou, O LORD, art on high forever.
19½Ã 92:9 For, behold, Thine enemies, O LORD, For, behold, Thine enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered.
19½Ã 92:10 But Thou hast exalted my horn like [that of] the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
19½Ã 92:11 And my eye has looked [exultantly] upon my foes, My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.
19½Ã 92:12 The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19½Ã 92:13 Planted in the house of the LORD, They will flourish in the courts of our God.
19½Ã 92:14 They will still yield fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and very green,
19½Ã 92:15 To declare that the LORD is upright; [He is] my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
19½Ã 93:1 The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.
19½Ã 93:2 Thy throne is established from of old; Thou art from everlasting.
19½Ã 93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their pounding waves.
19½Ã 93:4 More than the sounds of many waters, [Than] the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty.
19½Ã 93:5 Thy testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness befits Thy house, O LORD, forevermore.
19½Ã 94:1 O LORD, God of vengeance; God of vengeance, shine forth!
19½Ã 94:2 Rise up, O Judge of the earth; Render recompense to the proud.
19½Ã 94:3 How long shall the wicked, O LORD, How long shall the wicked exult?
19½Ã 94:4 They pour forth [words], they speak arrogantly; All who do wickedness vaunt themselves.
19½Ã 94:5 They crush Thy people, O LORD, And afflict Thy heritage.
19½Ã 94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the orphans.
19½Ã 94:7 And they have said, "The LORD does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed."
19½Ã 94:8 Pay heed, you senseless among the people; And when will you understand, stupid ones?
19½Ã 94:9 He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?
19½Ã 94:10 He who chastens the nations, will He not rebuke, [Even] He who teaches man knowledge?
19½Ã 94:11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man, That they are a [mere] breath.
19½Ã 94:12 Blessed is the man whom Thou dost chasten, O LORD, And dost teach out of Thy law;
19½Ã 94:13 That Thou mayest grant him relief from the days of adversity, Until a pit is dug for the wicked.
19½Ã 94:14 For the LORD will not abandon His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
19½Ã 94:15 For judgment will again be righteous; And all the upright in heart will follow it.
19½Ã 94:16 Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness?
19½Ã 94:17 If the LORD had not been my help, My soul would soon have dwelt in [the abode of] silence.
19½Ã 94:18 If I should say, "My foot has slipped," Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, will hold me up.
19½Ã 94:19 When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Thy consolations delight my soul.
19½Ã 94:20 Can a throne of destruction be allied with Thee, One which devises mischief by decree?
19½Ã 94:21 They band themselves together against the life of the righteous, And condemn the innocent to death.
19½Ã 94:22 But the LORD has been my stronghold, And my God the rock of my refuge.
19½Ã 94:23 And He has brought back their wickedness upon them, And will destroy them in their evil; The LORD our God will destroy them.
19½Ã 95:1 O come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
19½Ã 95:2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.
19½Ã 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, And a great King above all gods,
19½Ã 95:4 In whose hand are the depths of the earth; The peaks of the mountains are His also.
19½Ã 95:5 The sea is His, for it was He who made it; And His hands formed the dry land.
19½Ã 95:6 Come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.
19½Ã 95:7 For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice,
19½Ã 95:8 Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
19½Ã 95:9 "When your fathers tested Me, They tried Me, though they had seen My work.
19½Ã 95:10 "For forty years I loathed [that] generation, And said they are a people who err in their heart, And they do not know My ways.
19½Ã 95:11 "Therefore I swore in My anger, Truly they shall not enter into My rest."
19½Ã 96:1 Sing to the LORD a new song; Sing to the LORD, all the earth.
19½Ã 96:2 Sing to the LORD, bless His name; Proclaim good tidings of His salvation from day to day.
19½Ã 96:3 Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.
19½Ã 96:4 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
19½Ã 96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens.
19½Ã 96:6 Splendor and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
19½Ã 96:7 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
19½Ã 96:8 Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
19½Ã 96:9 Worship the LORD in holy attire; Tremble before Him, all the earth.
19½Ã 96:10 Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity."
19½Ã 96:11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and all it contains;
19½Ã 96:12 Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
19½Ã 96:13 Before the LORD, for He is coming; For He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness.
19½Ã 97:1 The LORD reigns; let the earth rejoice; Let the many islands be glad.
19½Ã 97:2 Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
19½Ã 97:3 Fire goes before Him, And burns up His adversaries round about.
19½Ã 97:4 His lightnings lit up the world; The earth saw and trembled.
19½Ã 97:5 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
19½Ã 97:6 The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His glory.
19½Ã 97:7 Let all those be ashamed who serve graven images, Who boast themselves of idols; Worship Him, all you gods.
19½Ã 97:8 Zion heard [this] and was glad, And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced Because of Thy judgments, O LORD.
19½Ã 97:9 For Thou art the LORD Most High over all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods.
19½Ã 97:10 Hate evil, you who love the LORD, Who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
19½Ã 97:11 Light is sown [like seed] for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.
19½Ã 97:12 Be glad in the LORD, you righteous ones; And give thanks to His holy name.
19½Ã 98:1 {A Psalm.} O Sing to the LORD a new song, For He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.
19½Ã 98:2 The LORD has made known His salvation; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
19½Ã 98:3 He has remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19½Ã 98:4 Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth; Break forth and sing for joy and sing praises.
19½Ã 98:5 Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre; With the lyre and the sound of melody.
19½Ã 98:6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn Shout joyfully before the King, the LORD.
19½Ã 98:7 Let the sea roar and all it contains, The world and those who dwell in it.
19½Ã 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands; Let the mountains sing together for joy
19½Ã 98:9 Before the LORD; for He is coming to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.
19½Ã 99:1 The LORD reigns, let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned [above] the cherubim, let the earth shake!
19½Ã 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion, And He is exalted above all the peoples.
19½Ã 99:3 Let them praise Thy great and awesome name; Holy is He.
19½Ã 99:4 And the strength of the King loves justice; Thou hast established equity; Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
19½Ã 99:5 Exalt the LORD our God, And worship at His footstool; Holy is He.
19½Ã 99:6 Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called on His name; They called upon the LORD, and He answered them.
19½Ã 99:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; They kept His testimonies, And the statute that He gave them.
19½Ã 99:8 O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them; Thou wast a forgiving God to them, And [yet] an avenger of their [evil] deeds.
19½Ã 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, And worship at His holy hill; For holy is the LORD our God.
19½Ã 100:1 {A Psalm for Thanksgiving.} Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth.
19½Ã 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before Him with joyful singing.
19½Ã 100:3 Know that the LORD Himself is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; [We are] His people and the sheep of His pasture.
19½Ã 100:4 Enter His gates with thanksgiving, [And] His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His name.
19½Ã 100:5 For the LORD is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting, And His faithfulness to all generations.
19½Ã 101:1 {A Psalm of David.} I will sing of lovingkindness and justice, To Thee, O LORD, I will sing praises.
19½Ã 101:2 I will give heed to the blameless way. When wilt Thou come to me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
19½Ã 101:3 I will set no worthless thing before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not fasten its grip on me.
19½Ã 101:4 A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil.
19½Ã 101:5 Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.
19½Ã 101:6 My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; He who walks in a blameless way is the one who will minister to me.
19½Ã 101:7 He who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me.
19½Ã 101:8 Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, So as to cut off from the city of the LORD all those who do iniquity.
19½Ã 102:1 {A Prayer of the Afflicted, when he is faint, and pours out his complaint} (before the LORD.) Hear my prayer, O LORD! And let my cry for help come to Thee.
19½Ã 102:2 Do not hide Thy face from me in the day of my distress; Incline Thine ear to me; In the day when I call answer me quickly.
19½Ã 102:3 For my days have been consumed in smoke, And my bones have been scorched like a hearth.
19½Ã 102:4 My heart has been smitten like grass and has withered away, Indeed, I forget to eat my bread.
19½Ã 102:5 Because of the loudness of my groaning My bones cling to my flesh.
19½Ã 102:6 I resemble a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl of the waste places.
19½Ã 102:7 I lie awake, I have become like a lonely bird on a housetop.
19½Ã 102:8 My enemies have reproached me all day long; Those who deride me have used my [name] as a curse.
19½Ã 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,
19½Ã 102:10 Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; For Thou hast lifted me up and cast me away.
19½Ã 102:11 My days are like a lengthened shadow; And I wither away like grass.
19½Ã 102:12 But Thou, O LORD, dost abide forever; And Thy name to all generations.
19½Ã 102:13 Thou wilt arise [and] have compassion on Zion; For it is time to be gracious to her, For the appointed time has come.
19½Ã 102:14 Surely Thy servants find pleasure in her stones, And feel pity for her dust.
19½Ã 102:15 So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, And all the kings of the earth Thy glory.
19½Ã 102:16 For the LORD has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.
19½Ã 102:17 He has regarded the prayer of the destitute, And has not despised their prayer.
19½Ã 102:18 This will be written for the generation to come; That a people yet to be created may praise the LORD.
19½Ã 102:19 For He looked down from His holy height; From heaven the LORD gazed upon the earth,
19½Ã 102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; To set free those who were doomed to death;
19½Ã 102:21 That [men] may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, And His praise in Jerusalem;
19½Ã 102:22 When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
19½Ã 102:23 He has weakened my strength in the way; He has shortened my days.
19½Ã 102:24 I say, "O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days, Thy years are throughout all generations.
19½Ã 102:25 "Of old Thou didst found the earth; And the heavens are the work of Thy hands.
19½Ã 102:26 "Even they will perish, but Thou dost endure; And all of them will wear out like a garment; Like clothing Thou wilt change them, and they will be changed.
19½Ã 102:27 "But Thou art the same, And Thy years will not come to an end.
19½Ã 102:28 "The children of Thy servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before Thee."
19½Ã 103:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} Bless the LORD, O my soul; And all that is within me, [bless] His holy name.
19½Ã 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, And forget none of His benefits;
19½Ã 103:3 Who pardons all your iniquities; Who heals all your diseases;
19½Ã 103:4 Who redeems your life from the pit; Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion;
19½Ã 103:5 Who satisfies your years with good things, [So that] your youth is renewed like the eagle.
19½Ã 103:6 The LORD performs righteous deeds, And judgments for all who are oppressed.
19½Ã 103:7 He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel.
19½Ã 103:8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness.
19½Ã 103:9 He will not always strive [with us]; Nor will He keep [His anger] forever.
19½Ã 103:10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
19½Ã 103:11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him.
19½Ã 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
19½Ã 103:13 Just as a father has compassion on [his] children, So the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
19½Ã 103:14 For He Himself knows our frame; He is mindful that we are [but] dust.
19½Ã 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
19½Ã 103:16 When the wind has passed over it, it is no more; And its place acknowledges it no longer.
19½Ã 103:17 But the lovingkindness of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children,
19½Ã 103:18 To those who keep His covenant, And who remember His precepts to do them.
19½Ã 103:19 The LORD has established His throne in the heavens; And His sovereignty rules over all.
19½Ã 103:20 Bless the LORD, you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word!
19½Ã 103:21 Bless the LORD, all you His hosts, You who serve Him, doing His will.
19½Ã 103:22 Bless the LORD, all you works of His, In all places of His dominion; Bless the LORD, O my soul!
19½Ã 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with splendor and majesty,
19½Ã 104:2 Covering Thyself with light as with a cloak, Stretching out heaven like a [tent] curtain.
19½Ã 104:3 He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks upon the wings of the wind;
19½Ã 104:4 He makes the winds His messengers, Flaming fire His ministers.
19½Ã 104:5 He established the earth upon its foundations, So that it will not totter forever and ever.
19½Ã 104:6 Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment; The waters were standing above the mountains.
19½Ã 104:7 At Thy rebuke they fled; At the sound of Thy thunder they hurried away.
19½Ã 104:8 The mountains rose; the valleys sank down To the place which Thou didst establish for them.
19½Ã 104:9 Thou didst set a boundary that they may not pass over; That they may not return to cover the earth.
19½Ã 104:10 He sends forth springs in the valleys; They flow between the mountains;
19½Ã 104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19½Ã 104:12 Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; They lift up [their] voices among the branches.
19½Ã 104:13 He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.
19½Ã 104:14 He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the labor of man, So that he may bring forth food from the earth,
19½Ã 104:15 And wine which makes man's heart glad, So that he may make [his] face glisten with oil, And food which sustains man's heart.
19½Ã 104:16 The trees of the LORD drink their fill, The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,
19½Ã 104:17 Where the birds build their nests, [And] the stork, whose home is the fir trees.
19½Ã 104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.
19½Ã 104:19 He made the moon for the seasons; The sun knows the place of its setting.
19½Ã 104:20 Thou dost appoint darkness and it becomes night, In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about.
19½Ã 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.
19½Ã 104:22 [When] the sun rises they withdraw, And lie down in their dens.
19½Ã 104:23 Man goes forth to his work And to his labor until evening.
19½Ã 104:24 O LORD, how many are Thy works! In wisdom Thou hast made them all; The earth is full of Thy possessions.
19½Ã 104:25 There is the sea, great and broad, In which are swarms without number, Animals both small and great.
19½Ã 104:26 There the ships move along, [And] Leviathan, which Thou hast formed to sport in it.
19½Ã 104:27 They all wait for Thee, To give them their food in due season.
19½Ã 104:28 Thou dost give to them, they gather [it] up; Thou dost open Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
19½Ã 104:29 Thou dost hide Thy face, they are dismayed; Thou dost take away their spirit, they expire, And return to their dust.
19½Ã 104:30 Thou dost send forth Thy Spirit, they are created; And Thou dost renew the face of the ground.
19½Ã 104:31 Let the glory of the LORD endure forever; Let the LORD be glad in His works;
19½Ã 104:32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
19½Ã 104:33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
19½Ã 104:34 Let my meditation be pleasing to Him; As for me, I shall be glad in the LORD.
19½Ã 104:35 Let sinners be consumed from the earth, And let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 105:1 Oh give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples.
19½Ã 105:2 Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; Speak of all His wonders.
19½Ã 105:3 Glory in His holy name; Let the heart of those who seek the LORD be glad.
19½Ã 105:4 Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.
19½Ã 105:5 Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels, and the judgments uttered by His mouth,
19½Ã 105:6 O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!
19½Ã 105:7 He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
19½Ã 105:8 He has remembered His covenant forever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
19½Ã 105:9 [The covenant] which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac.
19½Ã 105:10 Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
19½Ã 105:11 Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the portion of your inheritance,"
19½Ã 105:12 When they were only a few men in number, Very few, and strangers in it.
19½Ã 105:13 And they wandered about from nation to nation, From [one] kingdom to another people.
19½Ã 105:14 He permitted no man to oppress them, And He reproved kings for their sakes£º
19½Ã 105:15 "Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm."
19½Ã 105:16 And He called for a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.
19½Ã 105:17 He sent a man before them, Joseph, [who] was sold as a slave.
19½Ã 105:18 They afflicted his feet with fetters, He himself was laid in irons;
19½Ã 105:19 Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the LORD tested him.
19½Ã 105:20 The king sent and released him, The ruler of peoples, and set him free.
19½Ã 105:21 He made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions,
19½Ã 105:22 To imprison his princes at will, That he might teach his elders wisdom.
19½Ã 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; Thus Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
19½Ã 105:24 And He caused His people to be very fruitful, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
19½Ã 105:25 He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants.
19½Ã 105:26 He sent Moses His servant, [And] Aaron whom He had chosen.
19½Ã 105:27 They performed His wondrous acts among them, And miracles in the land of Ham.
19½Ã 105:28 He sent darkness and made [it] dark; And they did not rebel against His words.
19½Ã 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, And caused their fish to die.
19½Ã 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs [Even] in the chambers of their kings.
19½Ã 105:31 He spoke, and there came a swarm of flies [And] gnats in all their territory.
19½Ã 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land.
19½Ã 105:33 He struck down their vines also and their fig trees, And shattered the trees of their territory.
19½Ã 105:34 He spoke, and locusts came, And young locusts, even without number,
19½Ã 105:35 And ate up all vegetation in their land, And ate up the fruit of their ground.
19½Ã 105:36 He also struck down all the first-born in their land, The first fruits of all their vigor.
19½Ã 105:37 Then He brought them out with silver and gold; And among His tribes there was not one who stumbled.
19½Ã 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed; For the dread of them had fallen upon them.
19½Ã 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to illumine by night.
19½Ã 105:40 They asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
19½Ã 105:41 He opened the rock, and water flowed out; It ran in the dry places [like] a river.
19½Ã 105:42 For He remembered His holy word [With] Abraham His servant;
19½Ã 105:43 And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with a joyful shout.
19½Ã 105:44 He gave them also the lands of the nations, That they might take possession of [the fruit of] the peoples' labor,
19½Ã 105:45 So that they might keep His statutes, And observe His laws, Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 106:1 Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 106:2 Who can speak of the mighty deeds of the LORD, Or can show forth all His praise?
19½Ã 106:3 How blessed are those who keep justice, Who practice righteousness at all times!
19½Ã 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, in [Thy] favor toward Thy people; Visit me with Thy salvation,
19½Ã 106:5 That I may see the prosperity of Thy chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, That I may glory with Thine inheritance.
19½Ã 106:6 We have sinned like our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have behaved wickedly.
19½Ã 106:7 Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Thy wonders; They did not remember Thine abundant kindnesses, But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.
19½Ã 106:8 Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, That He might make His power known.
19½Ã 106:9 Thus He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up; And He led them through the deeps, as through the wilderness.
19½Ã 106:10 So He saved them from the hand of the one who hated [them,] And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
19½Ã 106:11 And the waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left.
19½Ã 106:12 Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.
19½Ã 106:13 They quickly forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,
19½Ã 106:14 But craved intensely in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.
19½Ã 106:15 So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease among them.
19½Ã 106:16 When they became envious of Moses in the camp, And of Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,
19½Ã 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And engulfed the company of Abiram.
19½Ã 106:18 And a fire blazed up in their company; The flame consumed the wicked.
19½Ã 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, And worshiped a molten image.
19½Ã 106:20 Thus they exchanged their glory For the image of an ox that eats grass.
19½Ã 106:21 They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,
19½Ã 106:22 Wonders in the land of Ham, [And] awesome things by the Red Sea.
19½Ã 106:23 Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood in the breach before Him, To turn away His wrath from destroying [them.]
19½Ã 106:24 Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe in His word,
19½Ã 106:25 But grumbled in their tents; They did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
19½Ã 106:26 Therefore He swore to them, That He would cast them down in the wilderness,
19½Ã 106:27 And that He would cast their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.
19½Ã 106:28 They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
19½Ã 106:29 Thus they provoked [Him] to anger with their deeds; And the plague broke out among them.
19½Ã 106:30 Then Phinehas stood up and interposed; And so the plague was stayed.
19½Ã 106:31 And it was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forever.
19½Ã 106:32 They also provoked [Him] to wrath at the waters of Meribah, So that it went hard with Moses on their account;
19½Ã 106:33 Because they were rebellious against His Spirit, He spoke rashly with his lips.
19½Ã 106:34 They did not destroy the peoples, As the LORD commanded them,
19½Ã 106:35 But they mingled with the nations, And learned their practices,
19½Ã 106:36 And served their idols, Which became a snare to them.
19½Ã 106:37 They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons,
19½Ã 106:38 And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with the blood.
19½Ã 106:39 Thus they became unclean in their practices, And played the harlot in their deeds.
19½Ã 106:40 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people, And He abhorred His inheritance.
19½Ã 106:41 Then He gave them into the hand of the nations; And those who hated them ruled over them.
19½Ã 106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were subdued under their power.
19½Ã 106:43 Many times He would deliver them; They, however, were rebellious in their counsel, And [so] sank down in their iniquity.
19½Ã 106:44 Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, When He heard their cry;
19½Ã 106:45 And He remembered His covenant for their sake, And relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.
19½Ã 106:46 He also made them [objects] of compassion In the presence of all their captors.
19½Ã 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, And glory in Thy praise.
19½Ã 106:48 Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 107:1 Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say [so], Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
19½Ã 107:3 And gathered from the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
19½Ã 107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region; They did not find a way to an inhabited city.
19½Ã 107:5 [They were] hungry and thirsty; Their soul fainted within them.
19½Ã 107:6 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He delivered them out of their distresses.
19½Ã 107:7 He led them also by a straight way, To go to an inhabited city.
19½Ã 107:8 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
19½Ã 107:9 For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, And the hungry soul He has filled with what is good.
19½Ã 107:10 There were those who dwelt in darkness and in the shadow of death, Prisoners in misery and chains,
19½Ã 107:11 Because they had rebelled against the words of God, And spurned the counsel of the Most High.
19½Ã 107:12 Therefore He humbled their heart with labor; They stumbled and there was none to help.
19½Ã 107:13 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them out of their distresses.
19½Ã 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their bands apart.
19½Ã 107:15 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
19½Ã 107:16 For He has shattered gates of bronze, And cut bars of iron asunder.
19½Ã 107:17 Fools, because of their rebellious way, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
19½Ã 107:18 Their soul abhorred all kinds of food; And they drew near to the gates of death.
19½Ã 107:19 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them out of their distresses.
19½Ã 107:20 He sent His word and healed them, And delivered [them] from their destructions.
19½Ã 107:21 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
19½Ã 107:22 Let them also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, And tell of His works with joyful singing.
19½Ã 107:23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business on great waters;
19½Ã 107:24 They have seen the works of the LORD, And His wonders in the deep.
19½Ã 107:25 For He spoke and raised up a stormy wind, Which lifted up the waves of the sea.
19½Ã 107:26 They rose up to the heavens, they went down to the depths; Their soul melted away in [their] misery.
19½Ã 107:27 They reeled and staggered like a drunken man, And were at their wits' end.
19½Ã 107:28 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, And He brought them out of their distresses.
19½Ã 107:29 He caused the storm to be still, So that the waves of the sea were hushed.
19½Ã 107:30 Then they were glad because they were quiet; So He guided them to their desired haven.
19½Ã 107:31 Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness, And for His wonders to the sons of men!
19½Ã 107:32 Let them extol Him also in the congregation of the people, And praise Him at the seat of the elders.
19½Ã 107:33 He changes rivers into a wilderness, And springs of water into a thirsty ground;
19½Ã 107:34 A fruitful land into a salt waste, Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
19½Ã 107:35 He changes a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into springs of water;
19½Ã 107:36 And there He makes the hungry to dwell, So that they may establish an inhabited city,
19½Ã 107:37 And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And gather a fruitful harvest.
19½Ã 107:38 Also He blesses them and they multiply greatly; And He does not let their cattle decrease.
19½Ã 107:39 When they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, misery, and sorrow,
19½Ã 107:40 He pours contempt upon princes, And makes them wander in a pathless waste.
19½Ã 107:41 But He sets the needy securely on high away from affliction, And makes [his] families like a flock.
19½Ã 107:42 The upright see it, and are glad; But all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
19½Ã 107:43 Who is wise? Let him give heed to these things; And consider the lovingkindnesses of the LORD.
19½Ã 108:1 {A Song, a Psalm of David.} My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.
19½Ã 108:2 Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!
19½Ã 108:3 I will give thanks to Thee, O LORD, among the peoples; And I will sing praises to Thee among the nations.
19½Ã 108:4 For Thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And Thy truth [ reaches] to the skies.
19½Ã 108:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Thy glory above all the earth.
19½Ã 108:6 That Thy beloved may be delivered, Save with Thy right hand, and answer me!
19½Ã 108:7 God has spoken in His holiness£º "I will exult, I will portion out Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth.
19½Ã 108:8 "Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter.
19½Ã 108:9 "Moab is My washbowl; Over Edom I shall throw My shoe; Over Philistia I will shout aloud."
19½Ã 108:10 Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19½Ã 108:11 Hast not Thou Thyself, O God, rejected us? And wilt Thou not go forth with our armies, O God?
19½Ã 108:12 Oh give us help against the adversary, For deliverance by man is in vain.
19½Ã 108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly; And it is He who will tread down our adversaries.
19½Ã 109:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} O God of my praise, Do not be silent!
19½Ã 109:2 For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me; They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
19½Ã 109:3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, And fought against me without cause.
19½Ã 109:4 In return for my love they act as my accusers; But I am [in] prayer.
19½Ã 109:5 Thus they have repaid me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
19½Ã 109:6 Appoint a wicked man over him; And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
19½Ã 109:7 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer become sin.
19½Ã 109:8 Let his days be few; Let another take his office.
19½Ã 109:9 Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.
19½Ã 109:10 Let his children wander about and beg; And let them seek [sustenance] far from their ruined homes.
19½Ã 109:11 Let the creditor seize all that he has; And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.
19½Ã 109:12 Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him, Nor any to be gracious to his fatherless children.
19½Ã 109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; In a following generation let their name be blotted out.
19½Ã 109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, And do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
19½Ã 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, That He may cut off their memory from the earth;
19½Ã 109:16 Because he did not remember to show lovingkindness, But persecuted the afflicted and needy man, And the despondent in heart, to put [ them] to death.
19½Ã 109:17 He also loved cursing, so it came to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so it was far from him.
19½Ã 109:18 But he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, And it entered into his body like water, And like oil into his bones.
19½Ã 109:19 Let it be to him as a garment with which he covers himself, And for a belt with which he constantly girds himself.
19½Ã 109:20 Let this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, And of those who speak evil against my soul.
19½Ã 109:21 But Thou, O GOD, the Lord, deal [kindly] with me for Thy name's sake; Because Thy lovingkindness is good, deliver me;
19½Ã 109:22 For I am afflicted and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.
19½Ã 109:23 I am passing like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like the locust.
19½Ã 109:24 My knees are weak from fasting; And my flesh has grown lean, without fatness.
19½Ã 109:25 I also have become a reproach to them; When they see me, they wag their head.
19½Ã 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God; Save me according to Thy lovingkindness.
19½Ã 109:27 And let them know that this is Thy hand; Thou, LORD, hast done it.
19½Ã 109:28 Let them curse, but do Thou bless; When they arise, they shall be ashamed, But Thy servant shall be glad.
19½Ã 109:29 Let my accusers be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
19½Ã 109:30 With my mouth I will give thanks abundantly to the LORD; And in the midst of many I will praise Him.
19½Ã 109:31 For He stands at the right hand of the needy, To save him from those who judge his soul.
19½Ã 110:1 {A Psalm of David.} The LORD says to my Lord£º "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Thine enemies a footstool for Thy feet."
19½Ã 110:2 The LORD will stretch forth Thy strong scepter from Zion, [saying], "Rule in the midst of Thine enemies."
19½Ã 110:3 Thy people will volunteer freely in the day of Thy power; In holy array, from the womb of the dawn, Thy youth are to Thee [as] the dew.
19½Ã 110:4 The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind, "Thou art a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."
19½Ã 110:5 The Lord is at Thy right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.
19½Ã 110:6 He will judge among the nations, He will fill [them] with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country.
19½Ã 110:7 He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up [His] head.
19½Ã 111:1 Praise the LORD! I will give thanks to the LORD with all [my] heart, In the company of the upright and in the assembly.
19½Ã 111:2 Great are the works of the LORD; [They are] studied by all who delight in them.
19½Ã 111:3 Splendid and majestic is His work; And His righteousness endures forever.
19½Ã 111:4 He has made His wonders to be remembered; The LORD is gracious and compassionate.
19½Ã 111:5 He has given food to those who fear Him; He will remember His covenant forever.
19½Ã 111:6 He has made known to His people the power of His works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.
19½Ã 111:7 The works of His hands are truth and justice; All His precepts are sure.
19½Ã 111:8 They are upheld forever and ever; They are performed in truth and uprightness.
19½Ã 111:9 He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever; Holy and awesome is His name.
19½Ã 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all those who do [His commandments]; His praise endures forever.
19½Ã 112:1 Praise the LORD! How blessed is the man who fears the LORD, Who greatly delights in His commandments.
19½Ã 112:2 His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed.
19½Ã 112:3 Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.
19½Ã 112:4 Light arises in the darkness for the upright; [He is] gracious and compassionate and righteous.
19½Ã 112:5 It is well with the man who is gracious and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment.
19½Ã 112:6 For he will never be shaken; The righteous will be remembered forever.
19½Ã 112:7 He will not fear evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.
19½Ã 112:8 His heart is upheld, he will not fear, Until he looks [with satisfaction] on his adversaries.
19½Ã 112:9 He has given freely to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted in honor.
19½Ã 112:10 The wicked will see it and be vexed; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish.
19½Ã 113:1 Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth and forever.
19½Ã 113:3 From the rising of the sun to its setting The name of the LORD is to be praised.
19½Ã 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.
19½Ã 113:5 Who is like the LORD our God, Who is enthroned on high,
19½Ã 113:6 Who humbles Himself to behold [The things that are] in heaven and in the earth?
19½Ã 113:7 He raises the poor from the dust, And lifts the needy from the ash heap,
19½Ã 113:8 To make [them] sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
19½Ã 113:9 He makes the barren woman abide in the house [As] a joyful mother of children. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 114:1 When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
19½Ã 114:2 Judah became His sanctuary, Israel, His dominion.
19½Ã 114:3 The sea looked and fled; The Jordan turned back.
19½Ã 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, The hills, like lambs.
19½Ã 114:5 What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
19½Ã 114:6 O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
19½Ã 114:7 Tremble, O earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob,
19½Ã 114:8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.
19½Ã 115:1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, But to Thy name give glory Because of Thy lovingkindness, because of Thy truth.
19½Ã 115:2 Why should the nations say, "Where, now, is their God?"
19½Ã 115:3 But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.
19½Ã 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, The work of man's hands.
19½Ã 115:5 They have mouths, but they cannot speak; They have eyes, but they cannot see;
19½Ã 115:6 They have ears, but they cannot hear; They have noses, but they cannot smell;
19½Ã 115:7 They have hands, but they cannot feel; They have feet, but they cannot walk; They cannot make a sound with their throat.
19½Ã 115:8 Those who make them will become like them, Everyone who trusts in them.
19½Ã 115:9 O Israel, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:11 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD; He is their help and their shield.
19½Ã 115:12 The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless [us]; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
19½Ã 115:13 He will bless those who fear the LORD, The small together with the great.
19½Ã 115:14 May the LORD give you increase, You and your children.
19½Ã 115:15 May you be blessed of the LORD, Maker of heaven and earth.
19½Ã 115:16 The heavens are the heavens of the LORD; But the earth He has given to the sons of men.
19½Ã 115:17 The dead do not praise the LORD, Nor [do] any who go down into silence;
19½Ã 115:18 But as for us, we will bless the LORD From this time forth and forever. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 116:1 I love the LORD, because He hears My voice [and] my supplications.
19½Ã 116:2 Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I shall call [upon Him] as long as I live.
19½Ã 116:3 The cords of death encompassed me, And the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.
19½Ã 116:4 Then I called upon the name of the LORD£º "O LORD, I beseech Thee, save my life!"
19½Ã 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yes, our God is compassionate.
19½Ã 116:6 The LORD preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
19½Ã 116:7 Return to your rest, O my soul, For the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.
19½Ã 116:8 For Thou hast rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from stumbling.
19½Ã 116:9 I shall walk before the LORD In the land of the living.
19½Ã 116:10 I believed when I said, "I am greatly afflicted."
19½Ã 116:11 I said in my alarm, "All men are liars."
19½Ã 116:12 What shall I render to the LORD For all His benefits toward me?
19½Ã 116:13 I shall lift up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 116:14 I shall pay my vows to the LORD, Oh [may it be] in the presence of all His people.
19½Ã 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His godly ones.
19½Ã 116:16 O LORD, surely I am Thy servant, I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast loosed my bonds.
19½Ã 116:17 To Thee I shall offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And call upon the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 116:18 I shall pay my vows to the LORD, Oh [may it be] in the presence of all His people,
19½Ã 116:19 In the courts of the Lord's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 117:1 Praise the LORD, all nations; Laud Him, all peoples!
19½Ã 117:2 For His lovingkindness is great toward us, And the truth of the LORD is everlasting. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 118:1 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 118:2 Oh let Israel say, "His lovingkindness is everlasting."
19½Ã 118:3 Oh let the house of Aaron say, "His lovingkindness is everlasting."
19½Ã 118:4 Oh let those who fear the LORD say, "His lovingkindness is everlasting."
19½Ã 118:5 From [my] distress I called upon the LORD; The LORD answered me [and set me] in a large place.
19½Ã 118:6 The LORD is for me; I will not fear; What can man do to me?
19½Ã 118:7 The LORD is for me among those who help me; Therefore I shall look [with satisfaction] on those who hate me.
19½Ã 118:8 It is better to take refuge in the LORD Than to trust in man.
19½Ã 118:9 It is better to take refuge in the LORD Than to trust in princes.
19½Ã 118:10 All nations surrounded me; In the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.
19½Ã 118:11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me; In the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.
19½Ã 118:12 They surrounded me like bees; They were extinguished as a fire of thorns; In the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.
19½Ã 118:13 You pushed me violently so that I was falling, But the LORD helped me.
19½Ã 118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation.
19½Ã 118:15 The sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
19½Ã 118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted; The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.
19½Ã 118:17 I shall not die, but live, And tell of the works of the LORD.
19½Ã 118:18 The LORD has disciplined me severely, But He has not given me over to death.
19½Ã 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness; I shall enter through them, I shall give thanks to the LORD.
19½Ã 118:20 This is the gate of the LORD; The righteous will enter through it.
19½Ã 118:21 I shall give thanks to Thee, for Thou hast answered me; And Thou hast become my salvation.
19½Ã 118:22 The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief corner [stone.]
19½Ã 118:23 This is the Lord's doing; It is marvelous in our eyes.
19½Ã 118:24 This is the day which the LORD has made; Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
19½Ã 118:25 O LORD, do save, we beseech Thee; O LORD, we beseech Thee, do send prosperity!
19½Ã 118:26 Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the LORD; We have blessed you from the house of the LORD.
19½Ã 118:27 The LORD is God, and He has given us light; Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.
19½Ã 118:28 Thou art my God, and I give thanks to Thee; [Thou art] my God, I extol Thee.
19½Ã 118:29 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 119:1 How blessed are those whose way is blameless, Who walk in the law of the LORD.
19½Ã 119:2 How blessed are those who observe His testimonies, Who seek Him with all [their] heart.
19½Ã 119:3 They also do no unrighteousness; They walk in His ways.
19½Ã 119:4 Thou hast ordained Thy precepts, That we should keep [them] diligently.
19½Ã 119:5 Oh that my ways may be established To keep Thy statutes!
19½Ã 119:6 Then I shall not be ashamed When I look upon all Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:7 I shall give thanks to Thee with uprightness of heart, When I learn Thy righteous judgments.
19½Ã 119:8 I shall keep Thy statutes; Do not forsake me utterly!
19½Ã 119:9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping [it] according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:10 With all my heart I have sought Thee; Do not let me wander from Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:11 Thy word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not sin against Thee.
19½Ã 119:12 Blessed art Thou, O LORD; Teach me Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:13 With my lips I have told of All the ordinances of Thy mouth.
19½Ã 119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of Thy testimonies, As much as in all riches.
19½Ã 119:15 I will meditate on Thy precepts, And regard Thy ways.
19½Ã 119:16 I shall delight in Thy statutes; I shall not forget Thy word.
19½Ã 119:17 Deal bountifully with Thy servant, That I may live and keep Thy word.
19½Ã 119:18 Open my eyes, that I may behold Wonderful things from Thy law.
19½Ã 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth; Do not hide Thy commandments from me.
19½Ã 119:20 My soul is crushed with longing After Thine ordinances at all times.
19½Ã 119:21 Thou dost rebuke the arrogant, the cursed, Who wander from Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:22 Take away reproach and contempt from me, For I observe Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:23 Even though princes sit and talk against me, Thy servant meditates on Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight; [They are] my counselors.
19½Ã 119:25 My soul cleaves to the dust; Revive me according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:26 I have told of my ways, and Thou hast answered me; Teach me Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:27 Make me understand the way of Thy precepts, So I will meditate on Thy wonders.
19½Ã 119:28 My soul weeps because of grief; Strengthen me according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:29 Remove the false way from me, And graciously grant me Thy law.
19½Ã 119:30 I have chosen the faithful way; I have placed Thine ordinances [before me.]
19½Ã 119:31 I cleave to Thy testimonies; O LORD, do not put me to shame!
19½Ã 119:32 I shall run the way of Thy commandments, For Thou wilt enlarge my heart.
19½Ã 119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of Thy statutes, And I shall observe it to the end.
19½Ã 119:34 Give me understanding, that I may observe Thy law, And keep it with all [my] heart.
19½Ã 119:35 Make me walk in the path of Thy commandments, For I delight in it.
19½Ã 119:36 Incline my heart to Thy testimonies, And not to [dishonest] gain.
19½Ã 119:37 Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And revive me in Thy ways.
19½Ã 119:38 Establish Thy word to Thy servant, As that which produces reverence for Thee.
19½Ã 119:39 Turn away my reproach which I dread, For Thine ordinances are good.
19½Ã 119:40 Behold, I long for Thy precepts; Revive me through Thy righteousness.
19½Ã 119:41 May Thy lovingkindnesses also come to me, O LORD, Thy salvation according to Thy word;
19½Ã 119:42 So I shall have an answer for him who reproaches me, For I trust in Thy word.
19½Ã 119:43 And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, For I wait for Thine ordinances.
19½Ã 119:44 So I will keep Thy law continually, Forever and ever.
19½Ã 119:45 And I will walk at liberty, For I seek Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:46 I will also speak of Thy testimonies before kings, And shall not be ashamed.
19½Ã 119:47 And I shall delight in Thy commandments, Which I love.
19½Ã 119:48 And I shall lift up my hands to Thy commandments, Which I love; And I will meditate on Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:49 Remember the word to Thy servant, In which Thou hast made me hope.
19½Ã 119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction, That Thy word has revived me.
19½Ã 119:51 The arrogant utterly deride me, [Yet] I do not turn aside from Thy law.
19½Ã 119:52 I have remembered Thine ordinances from of old, O LORD, And comfort myself.
19½Ã 119:53 Burning indignation has seized me because of the wicked, Who forsake Thy law.
19½Ã 119:54 Thy statutes are my songs In the house of my pilgrimage.
19½Ã 119:55 O LORD, I remember Thy name in the night, And keep Thy law.
19½Ã 119:56 This has become mine, That I observe Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:57 The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep Thy words.
19½Ã 119:58 I entreated Thy favor with all [my] heart; Be gracious to me according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:59 I considered my ways, And turned my feet to Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:60 I hastened and did not delay To keep Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:61 The cords of the wicked have encircled me, [But] I have not forgotten Thy law.
19½Ã 119:62 At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to Thee Because of Thy righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:63 I am a companion of all those who fear Thee, And of those who keep Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:64 The earth is full of Thy lovingkindness, O LORD; Teach me Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:65 Thou hast dealt well with Thy servant, O LORD, according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:66 Teach me good discernment and knowledge, For I believe in Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray, But now I keep Thy word.
19½Ã 119:68 Thou art good and doest good; Teach me Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:69 The arrogant have forged a lie against me; With all [my] heart I will observe Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:70 Their heart is covered with fat, [But] I delight in Thy law.
19½Ã 119:71 It is good for me that I was afflicted, That I may learn Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:72 The law of Thy mouth is better to me Than thousands of gold and silver [pieces].
19½Ã 119:73 Thy hands made me and fashioned me; Give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:74 May those who fear Thee see me and be glad, Because I wait for Thy word.
19½Ã 119:75 I know, O LORD, that Thy judgments are righteous, And that in faithfulness Thou hast afflicted me.
19½Ã 119:76 O may Thy lovingkindness comfort me, According to Thy word to Thy servant.
19½Ã 119:77 May Thy compassion come to me that I may live, For Thy law is my delight.
19½Ã 119:78 May the arrogant be ashamed, for they subvert me with a lie; [But] I shall meditate on Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:79 May those who fear Thee turn to me, Even those who know Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:80 May my heart be blameless in Thy statutes, That I may not be ashamed.
19½Ã 119:81 My soul languishes for Thy salvation; I wait for Thy word.
19½Ã 119:82 My eyes fail [with longing] for Thy word, While I say, "When wilt Thou comfort me?"
19½Ã 119:83 Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:84 How many are the days of Thy servant? When wilt Thou execute judgment on those who persecute me?
19½Ã 119:85 The arrogant have dug pits for me, [Men] who are not in accord with Thy law.
19½Ã 119:86 All Thy commandments are faithful; They have persecuted me with a lie; help me!
19½Ã 119:87 They almost destroyed me on earth, But as for me, I did not forsake Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:88 Revive me according to Thy lovingkindness, So that I may keep the testimony of Thy mouth.
19½Ã 119:89 Forever, O LORD, Thy word is settled in heaven.
19½Ã 119:90 Thy faithfulness [continues] throughout all generations; Thou didst establish the earth, and it stands.
19½Ã 119:91 They stand this day according to Thine ordinances, For all things are Thy servants.
19½Ã 119:92 If Thy law had not been my delight, Then I would have perished in my affliction.
19½Ã 119:93 I will never forget Thy precepts, For by them Thou hast revived me.
19½Ã 119:94 I am Thine, save me; For I have sought Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:95 The wicked wait for me to destroy me; I shall diligently consider Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:96 I have seen a limit to all perfection; Thy commandment is exceedingly broad.
19½Ã 119:97 O how I love Thy law! It is my meditation all the day.
19½Ã 119:98 Thy commandments make me wiser than my enemies, For they are ever mine.
19½Ã 119:99 I have more insight than all my teachers, For Thy testimonies are my meditation.
19½Ã 119:100 I understand more than the aged, Because I have observed Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:101 I have restrained my feet from every evil way, That I may keep Thy word.
19½Ã 119:102 I have not turned aside from Thine ordinances, For Thou Thyself hast taught me.
19½Ã 119:103 How sweet are Thy words to my taste! [Yes, sweeter] than honey to my mouth!
19½Ã 119:104 From Thy precepts I get understanding; Therefore I hate every false way.
19½Ã 119:105 Thy word is a lamp to my feet, And a light to my path.
19½Ã 119:106 I have sworn, and I will confirm it, That I will keep Thy righteous ordinances.
19½Ã 119:107 I am exceedingly afflicted; Revive me, O LORD, according to Thy word.
19½Ã 119:108 O accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, And teach me Thine ordinances.
19½Ã 119:109 My life is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget Thy law.
19½Ã 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, Yet I have not gone astray from Thy precepts.
19½Ã 119:111 I have inherited Thy testimonies forever, For they are the joy of my heart.
19½Ã 119:112 I have inclined my heart to perform Thy statutes Forever, [even] to the end.
19½Ã 119:113 I hate those who are double-minded, But I love Thy law.
19½Ã 119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield; I wait for Thy word.
19½Ã 119:115 Depart from me, evildoers, That I may observe the commandments of my God.
19½Ã 119:116 Sustain me according to Thy word, that I may live; And do not let me be ashamed of my hope.
19½Ã 119:117 Uphold me that I may be safe, That I may have regard for Thy statutes continually.
19½Ã 119:118 Thou hast rejected all those who wander from Thy statutes, For their deceitfulness is useless.
19½Ã 119:119 Thou hast removed all the wicked of the earth [like] dross; Therefore I love Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of Thee, And I am afraid of Thy judgments.
19½Ã 119:121 I have done justice and righteousness; Do not leave me to my oppressors.
19½Ã 119:122 Be surety for Thy servant for good; Do not let the arrogant oppress me.
19½Ã 119:123 My eyes fail [with longing] for Thy salvation, And for Thy righteous word.
19½Ã 119:124 Deal with Thy servant according to Thy lovingkindness, And teach me Thy statutes.
19½Ã 119:125 I am Thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know Thy testimonies.
19½Ã 119:126 It is time for the LORD to act, [For] they have broken Thy law.
19½Ã 119:127 Therefore I love Thy commandments Above gold, yes, above fine gold.
19½Ã 119:128 Therefore I esteem right all [Thy] precepts concerning everything, I hate every false way.
19½Ã 119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful; Therefore my soul observes them.
19½Ã 119:130 The unfolding of Thy words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple.
19½Ã 119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, For I longed for Thy commandments.
19½Ã 119:132 Turn to me and be gracious to me, After Thy manner with those who love Thy name.

19½Ã 120:1 {A Song of Ascents.} In my trouble I cried to the LORD, And He answered me.
19½Ã 120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue.
19½Ã 120:3 What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, You deceitful tongue?
19½Ã 120:4 Sharp arrows of the warrior, With the [burning] coals of the broom tree.
19½Ã 120:5 Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech, For I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
19½Ã 120:6 Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace.
19½Ã 120:7 I am [for] peace, but when I speak, They are for war.
19½Ã 121:1 {A Song of Ascents.} I Will lift up my eyes to the mountains; From whence shall my help come?
19½Ã 121:2 My help [comes] from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 121:3 He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber.
19½Ã 121:4 Behold, He who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
19½Ã 121:5 The LORD is your keeper; The LORD is your shade on your right hand.
19½Ã 121:6 The sun will not smite you by day, Nor the moon by night.
19½Ã 121:7 The LORD will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul.
19½Ã 121:8 The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in From this time forth and forever.
19½Ã 122:1 {A Song of Ascents, of David.} I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."
19½Ã 122:2 Our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem,
19½Ã 122:3 Jerusalem, that is built As a city that is compact together;
19½Ã 122:4 To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD-- An ordinance for Israel-- To give thanks to the name of the LORD.
19½Ã 122:5 For there thrones were set for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
19½Ã 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem£º "May they prosper who love you.
19½Ã 122:7 "May peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces."
19½Ã 122:8 For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, "May peace be within you."
19½Ã 122:9 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek your good.
19½Ã 123:1 {A Song of Ascents.} To Thee I lift up my eyes, O Thou who art enthroned in the heavens!
19½Ã 123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; So our eyes [look] to the LORD our God, Until He shall be gracious to us.
19½Ã 123:3 Be gracious to us, O LORD, be gracious to us; For we are greatly filled with contempt.
19½Ã 123:4 Our soul is greatly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, [And] with the contempt of the proud.
19½Ã 124:1 {A Song of Ascents, of David.} "Had it not been the LORD who was on our side," Let Israel now say,
19½Ã 124:2 "Had it not been the LORD who was on our side, When men rose up against us;
19½Ã 124:3 Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their anger was kindled against us;
19½Ã 124:4 Then the waters would have engulfed us, The stream would have swept over our soul;
19½Ã 124:5 Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul. "
19½Ã 124:6 Blessed be the LORD, Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth.
19½Ã 124:7 Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper; The snare is broken and we have escaped.
19½Ã 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 125:1 {A Song of Ascents.} Those who trust in the LORD Are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
19½Ã 125:2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the LORD surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.
19½Ã 125:3 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the righteous; That the righteous may not put forth their hands to do wrong.
19½Ã 125:4 Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.
19½Ã 125:5 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, The LORD will lead them away with the doers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
19½Ã 126:1 {A Song of Ascents.} When the LORD brought back the captive ones of Zion, We were like those who dream.
19½Ã 126:2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."
19½Ã 126:3 The LORD has done great things for us; We are glad.
19½Ã 126:4 Restore our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South.
19½Ã 126:5 Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.
19½Ã 126:6 He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying [his] bag of seed, Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves [with him].
19½Ã 127:1 {A Song of Ascents, of Solomon.} Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain.
19½Ã 127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, To retire late, To eat the bread of painful labors; For He gives to His beloved [even in his] sleep.
19½Ã 127:3 Behold, children are a gift of the LORD; The fruit of the womb is a reward.
19½Ã 127:4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth.
19½Ã 127:5 How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They shall not be ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
19½Ã 128:1 {A Song of Ascents.} How blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, Who walks in His ways.
19½Ã 128:2 When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You will be happy and it will be well with you.
19½Ã 128:3 Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine, Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table.
19½Ã 128:4 Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the LORD.
19½Ã 128:5 The LORD bless you from Zion, And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
19½Ã 128:6 Indeed, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
19½Ã 129:1 {A Song of Ascents.} "Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up," Let Israel now say,
19½Ã 129:2 "Many times they have persecuted me from my youth up; Yet they have not prevailed against me.
19½Ã 129:3 "The plowers plowed upon my back; They lengthened their furrows."
19½Ã 129:4 The LORD is righteous; He has cut in two the cords of the wicked.
19½Ã 129:5 May all who hate Zion, Be put to shame and turned backward,
19½Ã 129:6 Let them be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;
19½Ã 129:7 With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Or the binder of sheaves his bosom;
19½Ã 129:8 Nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD."
19½Ã 130:1 {A Song of Ascents.} Out of the depths I have cried to Thee, O LORD.
19½Ã 130:2 Lord, hear my voice! Let Thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
19½Ã 130:3 If Thou, LORD, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
19½Ã 130:4 But there is forgiveness with Thee, That Thou mayest be feared.
19½Ã 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait, And in His word do I hope.
19½Ã 130:6 My soul [waits] for the Lord More than the watchmen for the morning; [Indeed, more than] the watchmen for the morning.
19½Ã 130:7 O Israel, hope in the LORD; For with the LORD there is lovingkindness, And with Him is abundant redemption.
19½Ã 130:8 And He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
19½Ã 131:1 {A Song of Ascents, of David.} O LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty; Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too difficult for me.
19½Ã 131:2 Surely I have composed and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child [rests] against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me.
19½Ã 131:3 O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and forever.
19½Ã 132:1 {A Song of Ascents.} Remember, O LORD, on David's behalf, All his affliction;
19½Ã 132:2 How he swore to the LORD, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
19½Ã 132:3 "Surely I will not enter my house, Nor lie on my bed;
19½Ã 132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids;
19½Ã 132:5 Until I find a place for the LORD, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob. "
19½Ã 132:6 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the field of Jaar.
19½Ã 132:7 Let us go into His dwelling place; Let us worship at His footstool.
19½Ã 132:8 Arise, O LORD, to Thy resting place; Thou and the ark of Thy strength.
19½Ã 132:9 Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; And let Thy godly ones sing for joy.
19½Ã 132:10 For the sake of David Thy servant, Do not turn away the face of Thine anointed.
19½Ã 132:11 The LORD has sworn to David, A truth from which He will not turn back; "Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.
19½Ã 132:12 "If your sons will keep My covenant, And My testimony which I will teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forever."
19½Ã 132:13 For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.
19½Ã 132:14 "This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
19½Ã 132:15 "I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy with bread.
19½Ã 132:16 "Her priests also I will clothe with salvation; And her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.
19½Ã 132:17 "There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.
19½Ã 132:18 "His enemies I will clothe with shame; But upon himself his crown shall shine."
19½Ã 133:1 {A Song of Ascents, of David.} Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity!
19½Ã 133:2 It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard, [Even] Aaron's beard, Coming down upon the edge of his robes.
19½Ã 133:3 It is like the dew of Hermon, Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the LORD commanded the blessing-- life forever.
19½Ã 134:1 {A Song of Ascents.} Behold, bless the LORD, all servants of the LORD, Who serve by night in the house of the LORD!
19½Ã 134:2 Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And bless the LORD.
19½Ã 134:3 May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.
19½Ã 135:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD; Praise HIM, O servants of the LORD,
19½Ã 135:2 You who stand in the house of the LORD, In the courts of the house of our God!
19½Ã 135:3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; Sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.
19½Ã 135:4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel for His own possession.
19½Ã 135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.
19½Ã 135:6 Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.
19½Ã 135:7 He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who makes lightnings for the rain; Who brings forth the wind from His treasuries.
19½Ã 135:8 He smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast.
19½Ã 135:9 He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
19½Ã 135:10 He smote many nations, And slew mighty kings,
19½Ã 135:11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, And Og, king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan;
19½Ã 135:12 And He gave their land as a heritage, A heritage to Israel His people.
19½Ã 135:13 Thy name, O LORD, is everlasting, Thy remembrance, O LORD, throughout all generations.
19½Ã 135:14 For the LORD will judge His people, And will have compassion on His servants.
19½Ã 135:15 The idols of the nations are [but] silver and gold, The work of man's hands.
19½Ã 135:16 They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;
19½Ã 135:17 They have ears, but they do not hear; Nor is there any breath at all in their mouths.
19½Ã 135:18 Those who make them will be like them, [Yes,] everyone who trusts in them.
19½Ã 135:19 O house of Israel, bless the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless the LORD;
19½Ã 135:20 O house of Levi, bless the LORD; You who revere the LORD, bless the LORD.
19½Ã 135:21 Blessed be the LORD from Zion, Who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 136:1 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:2 Give thanks to the God of gods, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:3 Give thanks to the Lord of lords, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.

19½Ã 136:5 To Him who made the heavens with skill, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:6 To Him who spread out the earth above the waters, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:7 To Him who made [the] great lights, For His lovingkindness is everlasting£º
19½Ã 136:8 The sun to rule by day, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:10 To Him who smote the Egyptians in their first-born, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:11 And brought Israel out from their midst, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:12 With a strong hand and an outstretched arm, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:13 To Him who divided the Red Sea asunder, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:14 And made Israel pass through the midst of it, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:15 But He overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:16 To Him who led His people through the wilderness, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:17 To Him who smote great kings, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:18 And slew mighty kings, For His lovingkindness is everlasting£º
19½Ã 136:19 Sihon, king of the Amorites, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:20 And Og, king of Bashan, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:21 And gave their land as a heritage, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:22 Even a heritage to Israel His servant, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate, For His lovingkindness is everlasting,
19½Ã 136:24 And has rescued us from our adversaries, For His lovingkindness is everlasting;
19½Ã 136:25 Who gives food to all flesh, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 136:26 Give thanks to the God of heaven, For His lovingkindness is everlasting.
19½Ã 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down and wept, When we remembered Zion.
19½Ã 137:2 Upon the willows in the midst of it We hung our harps.
19½Ã 137:3 For there our captors demanded of us songs, And our tormentors mirth, [saying], "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
19½Ã 137:4 How can we sing the Lord's song In a foreign land?
19½Ã 137:5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, May my right hand forget [her skill.]
19½Ã 137:6 May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.
19½Ã 137:7 Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation."
19½Ã 137:8 O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid us.
19½Ã 137:9 How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock.
19½Ã 138:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} I will give Thee thanks with all my heart; I will sing praises to Thee before the gods.
19½Ã 138:2 I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, And give thanks to Thy name for Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth; For Thou hast magnified Thy word according to all Thy name.
19½Ã 138:3 On the day I called Thou didst answer me; Thou didst make me bold with strength in my soul.
19½Ã 138:4 All the kings of the earth will give thanks to Thee, O LORD, When they have heard the words of Thy mouth.
19½Ã 138:5 And they will sing of the ways of the LORD. For great is the glory of the LORD.
19½Ã 138:6 For though the LORD is exalted, Yet He regards the lowly; But the haughty He knows from afar.
19½Ã 138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth Thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, And Thy right hand will save me.
19½Ã 138:8 The LORD will accomplish what concerns me; Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is everlasting; Do not forsake the works of Thy hands.
19½Ã 139:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} O LORD, Thou hast searched me and known [me.]
19½Ã 139:2 Thou dost know when I sit down and when I rise up; Thou dost understand my thought from afar.
19½Ã 139:3 Thou dost scrutinize my path and my lying down, And art intimately acquainted with all my ways.
19½Ã 139:4 Even before there is a word on my tongue, Behold, O LORD, Thou dost know it all.
19½Ã 139:5 Thou hast enclosed me behind and before, And laid Thy hand upon me.
19½Ã 139:6 [Such] knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is [too] high, I cannot attain to it.
19½Ã 139:7 Where can I go from Thy Spirit? Or where can I flee from Thy presence?
19½Ã 139:8 If I ascend to heaven, Thou art there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, Thou art there.
19½Ã 139:9 If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,
19½Ã 139:10 Even there Thy hand will lead me, And Thy right hand will lay hold of me.
19½Ã 139:11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, And the light around me will be night,"
19½Ã 139:12 Even the darkness is not dark to Thee, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike [to Thee.]
19½Ã 139:13 For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb.
19½Ã 139:14 I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well.
19½Ã 139:15 My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, [And] skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth.
19½Ã 139:16 Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy book they were all written, The days that were ordained [for me], When as yet there was not one of them.
19½Ã 139:17 How precious also are Thy thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
19½Ã 139:18 If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with Thee.
19½Ã 139:19 O that Thou wouldst slay the wicked, O God; Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.
19½Ã 139:20 For they speak against Thee wickedly, And Thine enemies take [Thy name] in vain.
19½Ã 139:21 Do I not hate those who hate Thee, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against Thee?
19½Ã 139:22 I hate them with the utmost hatred; They have become my enemies.
19½Ã 139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts;
19½Ã 139:24 And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.
19½Ã 140:1 {For the choir director. A Psalm of David.} Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men,
19½Ã 140:2 Who devise evil things in [their] hearts; They continually stir up wars.
19½Ã 140:3 They sharpen their tongues as a serpent; Poison of a viper is under their lips. Selah.
19½Ã 140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to trip up my feet.
19½Ã 140:5 The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.
19½Ã 140:6 I said to the LORD, "Thou art my God; Give ear, O LORD, to the voice of my supplications.
19½Ã 140:7 "O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
19½Ã 140:8 "Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; Do not promote his [evil] device, [lest] they be exalted. Selah.
19½Ã 140:9 "As for the head of those who surround me, May the mischief of their lips cover them.
19½Ã 140:10 "May burning coals fall upon them; May they be cast into the fire, Into deep pits from which they cannot rise.
19½Ã 140:11 "May a slanderer not be established in the earth; May evil hunt the violent man speedily."
19½Ã 140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor.
19½Ã 140:13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to Thy name; The upright will dwell in Thy presence.
19½Ã 141:1 {A Psalm of David.} O Lord, I call upon Thee; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to Thee!
19½Ã 141:2 May my prayer be counted as incense before Thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
19½Ã 141:3 Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.
19½Ã 141:4 Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice deeds of wickedness With men who do iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.
19½Ã 141:5 Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me; It is oil upon the head; Do not let my head refuse it, For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.
19½Ã 141:6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, And they hear my words, for they are pleasant.
19½Ã 141:7 As when one plows and breaks open the earth, Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
19½Ã 141:8 For my eyes are toward Thee, O GOD, the Lord; In Thee I take refuge; do not leave me defenseless.
19½Ã 141:9 Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, And from the snares of those who do iniquity.
19½Ã 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I pass by safely.
19½Ã 142:1 {Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.} I cry aloud with my voice to the LORD; I make supplication with my voice to the LORD.
19½Ã 142:2 I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him.
19½Ã 142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou didst know my path. In the way where I walk They have hidden a trap for me.
19½Ã 142:4 Look to the right and see; For there is no one who regards me; There is no escape for me; No one cares for my soul.
19½Ã 142:5 I cried out to Thee, O LORD; I said, "Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
19½Ã 142:6 "Give heed to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.
19½Ã 142:7 "Bring my soul out of prison, So that I may give thanks to Thy name; The righteous will surround me, For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me."
19½Ã 143:1 {A Psalm of David.} Hear my prayer, O LORD, Give ear to my supplications! Answer me in Thy faithfulness, in Thy righteousness!
19½Ã 143:2 And do not enter into judgment with Thy servant, For in Thy sight no man living is righteous.
19½Ã 143:3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.
19½Ã 143:4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart is appalled within me.
19½Ã 143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doings; I muse on the work of Thy hands.
19½Ã 143:6 I stretch out my hands to Thee; My soul [longs] for Thee, as a parched land. Selah.
19½Ã 143:7 Answer me quickly, O LORD, my spirit fails; Do not hide Thy face from me, Lest I become like those who go down to the pit.
19½Ã 143:8 Let me hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning; For I trust in Thee; Teach me the way in which I should walk; For to Thee I lift up my soul.
19½Ã 143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies; I take refuge in Thee.
19½Ã 143:10 Teach me to do Thy will, For Thou art my God; Let Thy good Spirit lead me on level ground.
19½Ã 143:11 For the sake of Thy name, O LORD, revive me. In Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
19½Ã 143:12 And in Thy lovingkindness cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am Thy servant.
19½Ã 144:1 {[A Psalm] of David.} Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my hands for war, [And] my fingers for battle;
19½Ã 144:2 My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer; My shield and He in whom I take refuge; Who subdues my people under me.
19½Ã 144:3 O LORD, what is man, that Thou dost take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that Thou dost think of him?
19½Ã 144:4 Man is like a mere breath; His days are like a passing shadow.
19½Ã 144:5 Bow Thy heavens, O LORD, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
19½Ã 144:6 Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Send out Thine arrows and confuse them.
19½Ã 144:7 Stretch forth Thy hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens
19½Ã 144:8 Whose mouths speak deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
19½Ã 144:9 I will sing a new song to Thee, O God; Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to Thee,
19½Ã 144:10 Who dost give salvation to kings; Who dost rescue David His servant from the evil sword.
19½Ã 144:11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaks deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
19½Ã 144:12 Let our sons in their youth be as grown-up plants, And our daughters as corner pillars fashioned as for a palace;
19½Ã 144:13 [Let] our garners be full, furnishing every kind of produce, [And] our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
19½Ã 144:14 [Let] our cattle bear, Without mishap and without loss, [Let there be] no outcry in our streets!
19½Ã 144:15 How blessed are the people who are so situated; How blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!
19½Ã 145:1 {[A Psalm of] Praise, of David.} I will extol Thee, my God, O King; And I will bless Thy name forever and ever.
19½Ã 145:2 Every day I will bless Thee, And I will praise Thy name forever and ever.
19½Ã 145:3 Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.
19½Ã 145:4 One generation shall praise Thy works to another, And shall declare Thy mighty acts.
19½Ã 145:5 On the glorious splendor of Thy majesty, And on Thy wonderful works, I will meditate.
19½Ã 145:6 And men shall speak of the power of Thine awesome acts; And I will tell of Thy greatness.
19½Ã 145:7 They shall eagerly utter the memory of Thine abundant goodness, And shall shout joyfully of Thy righteousness.
19½Ã 145:8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness.
19½Ã 145:9 The LORD is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works.
19½Ã 145:10 All Thy works shall give thanks to Thee, O LORD, And Thy godly ones shall bless Thee.
19½Ã 145:11 They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, And talk of Thy power;
19½Ã 145:12 To make known to the sons of men Thy mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of Thy kingdom.
19½Ã 145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Thy dominion [endures] throughout all generations.
19½Ã 145:14 The LORD sustains all who fall, And raises up all who are bowed down.
19½Ã 145:15 The eyes of all look to Thee, And Thou dost give them their food in due time.
19½Ã 145:16 Thou dost open Thy hand, And dost satisfy the desire of every living thing.
19½Ã 145:17 The LORD is righteous in all His ways, And kind in all His deeds.
19½Ã 145:18 The LORD is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.
19½Ã 145:19 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry and will save them.
19½Ã 145:20 The LORD keeps all who love Him; But all the wicked, He will destroy.
19½Ã 145:21 My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD; And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.
19½Ã 146:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!
19½Ã 146:2 I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
19½Ã 146:3 Do not trust in princes, In mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.
19½Ã 146:4 His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.
19½Ã 146:5 How blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the LORD his God;
19½Ã 146:6 Who made heaven and earth, The sea and all that is in them; Who keeps faith forever;
19½Ã 146:7 Who executes justice for the oppressed; Who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free.
19½Ã 146:8 The LORD opens [the eyes of] the blind; The LORD raises up those who are bowed down; The LORD loves the righteous;
19½Ã 146:9 The LORD protects the strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow; But He thwarts the way of the wicked.
19½Ã 146:10 The LORD will reign forever, Thy God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 147:1 Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; For it is pleasant [and] praise is becoming.
19½Ã 147:2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.
19½Ã 147:3 He heals the brokenhearted, And binds up their wounds.
19½Ã 147:4 He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.
19½Ã 147:5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite.
19½Ã 147:6 The LORD supports the afflicted; He brings down the wicked to the ground.
19½Ã 147:7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; Sing praises to our God on the lyre,
19½Ã 147:8 Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who provides rain for the earth, Who makes grass to grow on the mountains.
19½Ã 147:9 He gives to the beast its food, [And] to the young ravens which cry.
19½Ã 147:10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.
19½Ã 147:11 The LORD favors those who fear Him, Those who wait for His lovingkindness.
19½Ã 147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!
19½Ã 147:13 For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons within you.
19½Ã 147:14 He makes peace in your borders; He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat.
19½Ã 147:15 He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly.
19½Ã 147:16 He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes.
19½Ã 147:17 He casts forth His ice as fragments; Who can stand before His cold?
19½Ã 147:18 He sends forth His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow and the waters to flow.
19½Ã 147:19 He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.
19½Ã 147:20 He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His ordinances, they have not known them. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 148:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; Praise Him in the heights!
19½Ã 148:2 Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts!
19½Ã 148:3 Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all stars of light!
19½Ã 148:4 Praise Him, highest heavens, And the waters that are above the heavens!
19½Ã 148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD, For He commanded and they were created.
19½Ã 148:6 He has also established them forever and ever; He has made a decree which will not pass away.
19½Ã 148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, Sea monsters and all deeps;
19½Ã 148:8 Fire and hail, snow and clouds; Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;
19½Ã 148:9 Mountains and all hills; Fruit trees and all cedars;
19½Ã 148:10 Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and winged fowl;
19½Ã 148:11 Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;
19½Ã 148:12 Both young men and virgins; Old men and children.
19½Ã 148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD, For His name alone is exalted; His glory is above earth and heaven.
19½Ã 148:14 And He has lifted up a horn for His people, Praise for all His godly ones; [Even] for the sons of Israel, a people near to Him. Praise the LORD !
19½Ã 149:1 Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, And His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.

19½Ã 149:4 For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the afflicted ones with salvation.
19½Ã 149:5 Let the godly ones exult in glory; Let them sing for joy on their beds.
19½Ã 149:6 [Let] the high praises of God [be] in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,
19½Ã 149:7 To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishment on the peoples;
19½Ã 149:8 To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
19½Ã 149:9 To execute on them the judgment written; This is an honor for all His godly ones. Praise the LORD!
19½Ã 150:1 Praise the LORD! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty expanse.
19½Ã 150:2 Praise Him for His mighty deeds; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.
19½Ã 150:3 Praise Him with trumpet sound; Praise Him with harp and lyre.
19½Ã 150:4 Praise Him with timbrel and dancing; Praise Him with stringed instruments and pipe.
19½Ã 150:5 Praise Him with loud cymbals; Praise Him with resounding cymbals.
19½Ã 150:6 Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!

20Àá 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel£º
20Àá 1:2 To know wisdom and instruction, To discern the sayings of understanding,
20Àá 1:3 To receive instruction in wise behavior, Righteousness, justice and equity;
20Àá 1:4 To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and discretion,
20Àá 1:5 A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel,
20Àá 1:6 To understand a proverb and a figure, The words of the wise and their riddles.
20Àá 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.
20Àá 1:8 Hear, my son, your father's instruction, And do not forsake your mother's teaching;
20Àá 1:9 Indeed, they are a graceful wreath to your head, And ornaments about your neck.
20Àá 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.
20Àá 1:11 If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without cause;
20Àá 1:12 Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who go down to the pit;
20Àá 1:13 We shall find all [kinds] of precious wealth, We shall fill our houses with spoil;
20Àá 1:14 Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have one purse, "
20Àá 1:15 My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path,
20Àá 1:16 For their feet run to evil, And they hasten to shed blood.
20Àá 1:17 Indeed, it is useless to spread the net In the eyes of any bird;
20Àá 1:18 But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their own lives.
20Àá 1:19 So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the life of its possessors.
20Àá 1:20 Wisdom shouts in the street, She lifts her voice in the square;
20Àá 1:21 At the head of the noisy [streets] she cries out; At the entrance of the gates in the city, she utters her sayings£º
20Àá 1:22 "How long, O naive ones, will you love simplicity? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?
20Àá 1:23 "Turn to my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.
20Àá 1:24 "Because I called, and you refused; I stretched out my hand, and no one paid attention;
20Àá 1:25 And you neglected all my counsel, And did not want my reproof;
20Àá 1:26 I will even laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes,
20Àá 1:27 When your dread comes like a storm, And your calamity comes on like a whirlwind, When distress [and] anguish come on you.
20Àá 1:28 "Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me,
20Àá 1:29 Because they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of the LORD.
20Àá 1:30 "They would not accept my counsel, They spurned all my reproof.
20Àá 1:31 "So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, And be satiated with their own devices.
20Àá 1:32 "For the waywardness of the naive shall kill them, And the complacency of fools shall destroy them.
20Àá 1:33 "But he who listens to me shall live securely, And shall be at ease from the dread of evil."
20Àá 2:1 My son, if you will receive my sayings, And treasure my commandments within you,
20Àá 2:2 Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to understanding;
20Àá 2:3 For if you cry for discernment, Lift your voice for understanding;
20Àá 2:4 If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures;
20Àá 2:5 Then you will discern the fear of the LORD, And discover the knowledge of God.
20Àá 2:6 For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.
20Àá 2:7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; [He is] a shield to those who walk in integrity,
20Àá 2:8 Guarding the paths of justice, And He preserves the way of His godly ones.
20Àá 2:9 Then you will discern righteousness and justice And equity [and] every good course.
20Àá 2:10 For wisdom will enter your heart, And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
20Àá 2:11 Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over you,
20Àá 2:12 To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things;
20Àá 2:13 From those who leave the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
20Àá 2:14 Who delight in doing evil, And rejoice in the perversity of evil;
20Àá 2:15 Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways;
20Àá 2:16 To deliver you from the strange woman, From the adulteress who flatters with her words;
20Àá 2:17 That leaves the companion of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God;
20Àá 2:18 For her house sinks down to death, And her tracks [lead] to the dead;
20Àá 2:19 None who go to her return again, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
20Àá 2:20 So you will walk in the way of good men, And keep to the paths of the righteous.
20Àá 2:21 For the upright will live in the land, And the blameless will remain in it;
20Àá 2:22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land, And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
20Àá 3:1 My son, do not forget my teaching, But let your heart keep my commandments;
20Àá 3:2 For length of days and years of life, And peace they will add to you.
20Àá 3:3 Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Àá 3:4 So you will find favor and good repute In the sight of God and man.
20Àá 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And do not lean on your own understanding.
20Àá 3:6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight.
20Àá 3:7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
20Àá 3:8 It will be healing to your body, And refreshment to your bones.
20Àá 3:9 Honor the LORD from your wealth, And from the first of all your produce;
20Àá 3:10 So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine.
20Àá 3:11 My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, Or loathe His reproof,
20Àá 3:12 For whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father, the son in whom he delights.
20Àá 3:13 How blessed is the man who finds wisdom, And the man who gains understanding.
20Àá 3:14 For its profit is better than the profit of silver, And its gain than fine gold.
20Àá 3:15 She is more precious than jewels; And nothing you desire compares with her.
20Àá 3:16 Long life is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.
20Àá 3:17 Her ways are pleasant ways, And all her paths are peace.
20Àá 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy are all who hold her fast.
20Àá 3:19 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens.
20Àá 3:20 By His knowledge the deeps were broken up, And the skies drip with dew.
20Àá 3:21 My son, let them not depart from your sight; Keep sound wisdom and discretion,
20Àá 3:22 So they will be life to your soul, And adornment to your neck.
20Àá 3:23 Then you will walk in your way securely, And your foot will not stumble.
20Àá 3:24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid; When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20Àá 3:25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear, Nor of the onslaught of the wicked when it comes;
20Àá 3:26 For the LORD will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught.
20Àá 3:27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in your power to do [it.]
20Àá 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give [it,]" When you have it with you.
20Àá 3:29 Do not devise harm against your neighbor, While he lives in security beside you.
20Àá 3:30 Do not contend with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm.
20Àá 3:31 Do not envy a man of violence, And do not choose any of his ways.
20Àá 3:32 For the crooked [man] is an abomination to the LORD; But He is intimate with the upright.
20Àá 3:33 The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
20Àá 3:34 Though He scoffs at the scoffers, Yet He gives grace to the afflicted.
20Àá 3:35 The wise will inherit honor, But fools display dishonor.
20Àá 4:1 Hear, [O] sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention that you may gain understanding,
20Àá 4:2 For I give you sound teaching; Do not abandon my instruction.
20Àá 4:3 When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother,
20Àá 4:4 Then he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live;
20Àá 4:5 Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
20Àá 4:6 "Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch over you.
20Àá 4:7 "The beginning of wisdom [is:] Acquire wisdom; And with all your acquiring, get understanding.
20Àá 4:8 "Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her.
20Àá 4:9 "She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty."
20Àá 4:10 Hear, my son, and accept my sayings, And the years of your life will be many.
20Àá 4:11 I have directed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths.
20Àá 4:12 When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; And if you run, you will not stumble.
20Àá 4:13 Take hold of instruction; do not let go. Guard her, for she is your life.
20Àá 4:14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not proceed in the way of evil men.
20Àá 4:15 Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on.
20Àá 4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; And they are robbed of sleep unless they make [someone] stumble.
20Àá 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
20Àá 4:18 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, That shines brighter and brighter until the full day.
20Àá 4:19 The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know over what they stumble.
20Àá 4:20 My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.
20Àá 4:21 Do not let them depart from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart.
20Àá 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their whole body.
20Àá 4:23 Watch over your heart with all diligence, For from it [flow] the springs of life.
20Àá 4:24 Put away from you a deceitful mouth, And put devious lips far from you.
20Àá 4:25 Let your eyes look directly ahead, And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you.
20Àá 4:26 Watch the path of your feet, And all your ways will be established.
20Àá 4:27 Do not turn to the right nor to the left; Turn your foot from evil.
20Àá 5:1 My son, give attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my understanding;
20Àá 5:2 That you may observe discretion, And your lips may reserve knowledge.
20Àá 5:3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, And smoother than oil is her speech;
20Àá 5:4 But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
20Àá 5:5 Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of Sheol.
20Àá 5:6 She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable, she does not know [it].
20Àá 5:7 Now then, [my] sons, listen to me, And do not depart from the words of my mouth.
20Àá 5:8 Keep your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house,
20Àá 5:9 Lest you give your vigor to others, And your years to the cruel one;
20Àá 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with your strength, And your hard-earned goods [go] to the house of an alien;
20Àá 5:11 And you groan at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed;
20Àá 5:12 And you say, "How I have hated instruction! And my heart spurned reproof!
20Àá 5:13 "And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to my instructors!
20Àá 5:14 "I was almost in utter ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation."
20Àá 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, And fresh water from your own well.
20Àá 5:16 Should your springs be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets?
20Àá 5:17 Let them be yours alone, And not for strangers with you.
20Àá 5:18 Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your youth.
20Àá 5:19 [As] a loving hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be exhilarated always with her love.
20Àá 5:20 For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
20Àá 5:21 For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He watches all his paths.
20Àá 5:22 His own iniquities will capture the wicked, And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
20Àá 5:23 He will die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
20Àá 6:1 My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, Have given a pledge for a stranger,
20Àá 6:2 [If] you have been snared with the words of your mouth, Have been caught with the words of your mouth,
20Àá 6:3 Do this then, my son, and deliver yourself; Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor, Go, humble yourself, and importune your neighbor.
20Àá 6:4 Do not give sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids;
20Àá 6:5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from [the hunter's] hand, And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
20Àá 6:6 Go to the ant, O sluggard, Observe her ways and be wise,
20Àá 6:7 Which, having no chief, Officer or ruler,
20Àá 6:8 Prepares her food in the summer, [And] gathers her provision in the harvest.
20Àá 6:9 How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?
20Àá 6:10 "A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest"--
20Àá 6:11 And your poverty will come in like a vagabond, And your need like an armed man.
20Àá 6:12 A worthless person, a wicked man, Is the one who walks with a false mouth,
20Àá 6:13 Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who points with his fingers;
20Àá 6:14 Who [with] perversity in his heart devises evil continually, Who spreads strife.
20Àá 6:15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; Instantly he will be broken, and there will be no healing.
20Àá 6:16 There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him£º
20Àá 6:17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood,
20Àá 6:18 A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to evil,
20Àá 6:19 A false witness [who] utters lies, And one who spreads strife among brothers.
20Àá 6:20 My son, observe the commandment of your father, And do not forsake the teaching of your mother;
20Àá 6:21 Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them around your neck.
20Àá 6:22 When you walk about, they will guide you; When you sleep, they will watch over you; And when you awake, they will talk to you.
20Àá 6:23 For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light; And reproofs for discipline are the way of life,
20Àá 6:24 To keep you from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
20Àá 6:25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her catch you with her eyelids.
20Àá 6:26 For on account of a harlot [one is reduced] to a loaf of bread, And an adulteress hunts for the precious life.
20Àá 6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
20Àá 6:28 Or can a man walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
20Àá 6:29 So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.
20Àá 6:30 Men do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry;
20Àá 6:31 But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold; He must give all the substance of his house.
20Àá 6:32 The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He who would destroy himself does it.
20Àá 6:33 Wounds and disgrace he will find, And his reproach will not be blotted out.
20Àá 6:34 For jealousy enrages a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
20Àá 6:35 He will not accept any ransom, Nor will he be content though you give many gifts.
20Àá 7:1 My son, keep my words, And treasure my commandments within you.
20Àá 7:2 Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye.
20Àá 7:3 Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Àá 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," And call understanding [your] intimate friend;
20Àá 7:5 That they may keep you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.
20Àá 7:6 For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,
20Àá 7:7 And I saw among the naive, I discerned among the youths, A young man lacking sense,
20Àá 7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; And he takes the way to her house,
20Àá 7:9 In the twilight, in the evening, In the middle of the night and [in] the darkness.
20Àá 7:10 And behold, a woman [comes] to meet him, Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.
20Àá 7:11 She is boisterous and rebellious; Her feet do not remain at home;
20Àá 7:12 [She is] now in the streets, now in the squares, And lurks by every corner.
20Àá 7:13 So she seizes him and kisses him, And with a brazen face she says to him£º
20Àá 7:14 "I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows.
20Àá 7:15 "Therefore I have come out to meet you, To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you.
20Àá 7:16 "I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of Egypt.
20Àá 7:17 "I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
20Àá 7:18 "Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses.
20Àá 7:19 "For the man is not at home, He has gone on a long journey;
20Àá 7:20 He has taken a bag of money with him, At full moon he will come home. "
20Àá 7:21 With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering lips she seduces him.
20Àá 7:22 Suddenly he follows her, As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the discipline of a fool,
20Àá 7:23 Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it [will cost him] his life.
20Àá 7:24 Now therefore, [my] sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth.
20Àá 7:25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths.
20Àá 7:26 For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are all her slain.
20Àá 7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death.
20Àá 8:1 Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice?
20Àá 8:2 On top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
20Àá 8:3 Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she cries out£º
20Àá 8:4 "To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.
20Àá 8:5 "O naive ones, discern prudence; And, O fools, discern wisdom.
20Àá 8:6 "Listen, for I shall speak noble things; And the opening of my lips [ will produce] right things.
20Àá 8:7 "For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
20Àá 8:8 "All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.
20Àá 8:9 "They are all straightforward to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge.
20Àá 8:10 "Take my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choicest gold.
20Àá 8:11 "For wisdom is better than jewels; And all desirable things can not compare with her.
20Àá 8:12 "I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And I find knowledge [and] discretion.
20Àá 8:13 "The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way, And the perverted mouth, I hate.
20Àá 8:14 "Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.
20Àá 8:15 "By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice.
20Àá 8:16 "By me princes rule, and nobles, All who judge rightly.
20Àá 8:17 "I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me will find me.
20Àá 8:18 "Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and righteousness.
20Àá 8:19 "My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield than choicest silver.
20Àá 8:20 "I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice,
20Àá 8:21 To endow those who love me with wealth, That I may fill their treasuries.
20Àá 8:22 "The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old.
20Àá 8:23 "From everlasting I was established, From the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.
20Àá 8:24 "When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no springs abounding with water.
20Àá 8:25 "Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills I was brought forth;
20Àá 8:26 While He had not yet made the earth and the fields, Nor the first dust of the world.
20Àá 8:27 "When He established the heavens, I was there, When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,
20Àá 8:28 When He made firm the skies above, When the springs of the deep became fixed,
20Àá 8:29 When He set for the sea its boundary, So that the water should not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth;
20Àá 8:30 Then I was beside Him, [as] a master workman; And I was daily [His] delight, Rejoicing always before Him,
20Àá 8:31 Rejoicing in the world, His earth, And [having] my delight in the sons of men.
20Àá 8:32 "Now therefore, [O] sons, listen to me, For blessed are they who keep my ways.
20Àá 8:33 "Heed instruction and be wise, And do not neglect [it.]
20Àá 8:34 "Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.
20Àá 8:35 "For he who finds me finds life, And obtains favor from the LORD.
20Àá 8:36 "But he who sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love death."
20Àá 9:1 Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars;
20Àá 9:2 She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table;
20Àá 9:3 She has sent out her maidens, she calls From the tops of the heights of the city£º
20Àá 9:4 "Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks understanding she says,
20Àá 9:5 "Come, eat of my food, And drink of the wine I have mixed.
20Àá 9:6 "Forsake [your] folly and live, And proceed in the way of understanding."
20Àá 9:7 He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And he who reproves a wicked man [gets] insults for himself.
20Àá 9:8 Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you, Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
20Àá 9:9 Give [instruction] to a wise man, and he will be still wiser, Teach a righteous man, and he will increase [his] learning.
20Àá 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
20Àá 9:11 For by me your days will be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you.
20Àá 9:12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
20Àá 9:13 The woman of folly is boisterous, [She is] naive, and knows nothing.
20Àá 9:14 And she sits at the doorway of her house, On a seat by the high places of the city,
20Àá 9:15 Calling to those who pass by, Who are making their paths straight£º
20Àá 9:16 "Whoever is naive, let him turn in here," And to him who lacks understanding she says,
20Àá 9:17 "Stolen water is sweet; And bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant."
20Àá 9:18 But he does not know that the dead are there, [That] her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
20Àá 10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
20Àá 10:2 Ill-gotten gains do not profit, But righteousness delivers from death.
20Àá 10:3 The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, But He will thrust [aside] the craving of the wicked.
20Àá 10:4 Poor is he who works with a negligent hand, But the hand of the diligent makes rich.
20Àá 10:5 He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, [But] he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.
20Àá 10:6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous, But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
20Àá 10:7 The memory of the righteous is blessed, But the name of the wicked will rot.
20Àá 10:8 The wise of heart will receive commands, But a babbling fool will be thrown down.
20Àá 10:9 He who walks in integrity walks securely, But he who perverts his ways will be found out.
20Àá 10:10 He who winks the eye causes trouble, And a babbling fool will be thrown down.
20Àá 10:11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
20Àá 10:12 Hatred stirs up strife, But love covers all transgressions.
20Àá 10:13 On the lips of the discerning, wisdom is found, But a rod is for the back of him who lacks understanding.
20Àá 10:14 Wise men store up knowledge, But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand.
20Àá 10:15 The rich man's wealth is his fortress, The ruin of the poor is their poverty.
20Àá 10:16 The wages of the righteous is life, The income of the wicked, punishment.
20Àá 10:17 He is [on] the path of life who heeds instruction, But he who forsakes reproof goes astray.
20Àá 10:18 He who conceals hatred [has] lying lips, And he who spreads slander is a fool.
20Àá 10:19 When there are many words, transgression is unavoidable, But he who restrains his lips is wise.
20Àá 10:20 The tongue of the righteous is [as] choice silver, The heart of the wicked is [worth] little.
20Àá 10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many, But fools die for lack of understanding.
20Àá 10:22 It is the blessing of the LORD that makes rich, And He adds no sorrow to it.
20Àá 10:23 Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool; And [so is] wisdom to a man of understanding.
20Àá 10:24 What the wicked fears will come upon him, And the desire of the righteous will be granted.
20Àá 10:25 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, But the righteous [has] an everlasting foundation.
20Àá 10:26 Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So is the lazy one to those who send him.
20Àá 10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongs life, But the years of the wicked will be shortened.
20Àá 10:28 The hope of the righteous is gladness, But the expectation of the wicked perishes.
20Àá 10:29 The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright, But ruin to the workers of iniquity.
20Àá 10:30 The righteous will never be shaken, But the wicked will not dwell in the land.
20Àá 10:31 The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, But the perverted tongue will be cut out.
20Àá 10:32 The lips of the righteous bring forth what is acceptable, But the mouth of the wicked, what is perverted.
20Àá 11:1 A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, But a just weight is His delight.
20Àá 11:2 When pride comes, then comes dishonor, But with the humble is wisdom.
20Àá 11:3 The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the falseness of the treacherous will destroy them.
20Àá 11:4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers from death.
20Àá 11:5 The righteousness of the blameless will smooth his way, But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.
20Àá 11:6 The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, But the treacherous will be caught by [their own] greed.
20Àá 11:7 When a wicked man dies, [his] expectation will perish, And the hope of strong men perishes.
20Àá 11:8 The righteous is delivered from trouble, But the wicked takes his place.
20Àá 11:9 With [his] mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.
20Àá 11:10 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices, And when the wicked perish, there is glad shouting.
20Àá 11:11 By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.
20Àá 11:12 He who despises his neighbor lacks sense, But a man of understanding keeps silent.
20Àá 11:13 He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets, But he who is trustworthy conceals a matter.
20Àá 11:14 Where there is no guidance, the people fall, But in abundance of counselors there is victory.
20Àá 11:15 He who is surety for a stranger will surely suffer for it, But he who hates going surety is safe.
20Àá 11:16 A gracious woman attains honor, And violent men attain riches.
20Àá 11:17 The merciful man does himself good, But the cruel man does himself harm.
20Àá 11:18 The wicked earns deceptive wages, But he who sows righteousness [gets] a true reward.
20Àá 11:19 He who is steadfast in righteousness [will attain] to life, And he who pursues evil [will bring about] his own death.
20Àá 11:20 The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, But the blameless in [their] walk are His delight.
20Àá 11:21 Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished, But the descendants of the righteous will be delivered.
20Àá 11:22 [As] a ring of gold in a swine's snout, [So is] a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.
20Àá 11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good, [But] the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
20Àá 11:24 There is one who scatters, yet increases all the more, And there is one who withholds what is justly due, but [it results] only in want.
20Àá 11:25 The generous man will be prosperous, And he who waters will himself be watered.
20Àá 11:26 He who withholds grain, the people will curse him, But blessing will be on the head of him who sells [it.]
20Àá 11:27 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, But he who searches after evil, it will come to him.
20Àá 11:28 He who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like the [green] leaf.
20Àá 11:29 He who troubles his own house will inherit wind, And the foolish will be servant to the wisehearted.
20Àá 11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And he who is wise wins souls.
20Àá 11:31 If the righteous will be rewarded in the earth, How much more the wicked and the sinner!
20Àá 12:1 Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, But he who hates reproof is stupid.
20Àá 12:2 A good man will obtain favor from the LORD, But He will condemn a man who devises evil.
20Àá 12:3 A man will not be established by wickedness, But the root of the righteous will not be moved.
20Àá 12:4 An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, But she who shames [ him] is as rottenness in his bones.
20Àá 12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are just, [But] the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.
20Àá 12:6 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, But the mouth of the upright will deliver them.
20Àá 12:7 The wicked are overthrown and are no more, But the house of the righteous will stand.
20Àá 12:8 A man will be praised according to his insight, But one of perverse mind will be despised.
20Àá 12:9 Better is he who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, Than he who honors himself and lacks bread.
20Àá 12:10 A righteous man has regard for the life of his beast, But the compassion of the wicked is cruel.
20Àá 12:11 He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who pursues vain [things] lacks sense.
20Àá 12:12 The wicked desires the booty of evil men, But the root of the righteous yields [fruit.]
20Àá 12:13 An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips, But the righteous will escape from trouble.
20Àá 12:14 A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his words, And the deeds of a man's hands will return to him.
20Àá 12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, But a wise man is he who listens to counsel.
20Àá 12:16 A fool's vexation is known at once, But a prudent man conceals dishonor.
20Àá 12:17 He who speaks truth tells what is right, But a false witness, deceit.
20Àá 12:18 There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, But the tongue of the wise brings healing.
20Àá 12:19 Truthful lips will be established forever, But a lying tongue is only for a moment.
20Àá 12:20 Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, But counselors of peace have joy.
20Àá 12:21 No harm befalls the righteous, But the wicked are filled with trouble.
20Àá 12:22 Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, But those who deal faithfully are His delight.
20Àá 12:23 A prudent man conceals knowledge, But the heart of fools proclaims folly.
20Àá 12:24 The hand of the diligent will rule, But the slack [hand] will be put to forced labor.
20Àá 12:25 Anxiety in the heart of a man weighs it down, But a good word makes it glad.
20Àá 12:26 The righteous is a guide to his neighbor, But the way of the wicked leads them astray.
20Àá 12:27 A slothful man does not roast his prey, But the precious possession of a man [is] diligence.
20Àá 12:28 In the way of righteousness is life, And in [its] pathway there is no death.
20Àá 13:1 A wise son [accepts his] father's discipline, But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
20Àá 13:2 From the fruit of a man's mouth he enjoys good, But the desire of the treacherous is violence.
20Àá 13:3 The one who guards his mouth preserves his life; The one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
20Àá 13:4 The soul of the sluggard craves and [gets] nothing, But the soul of the diligent is made fat.
20Àá 13:5 A righteous man hates falsehood, But a wicked man acts disgustingly and shamefully.
20Àá 13:6 Righteousness guards the one whose way is blameless, But wickedness subverts the sinner.
20Àá 13:7 There is one who pretends to be rich, but has nothing; [Another] pretends to be poor, but has great wealth.
20Àá 13:8 The ransom of a man's life is his riches, But the poor hears no rebuke.
20Àá 13:9 The light of the righteous rejoices, But the lamp of the wicked goes out.
20Àá 13:10 Through presumption comes nothing but strife, But with those who receive counsel is wisdom.
20Àá 13:11 Wealth [obtained] by fraud dwindles, But the one who gathers by labor increases [it.]
20Àá 13:12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, But desire fulfilled is a tree of life.
20Àá 13:13 The one who despises the word will be in debt to it, But the one who fears the commandment will be rewarded.
20Àá 13:14 The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, To turn aside from the snares of death.
20Àá 13:15 Good understanding produces favor, But the way of the treacherous is hard.
20Àá 13:16 Every prudent man acts with knowledge, But a fool displays folly.
20Àá 13:17 A wicked messenger falls into adversity, But a faithful envoy [brings] healing.
20Àá 13:18 Poverty and shame [will come] to him who neglects discipline, But he who regards reproof will be honored.
20Àá 13:19 Desire realized is sweet to the soul, But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.
20Àá 13:20 He who walks with wise men will be wise, But the companion of fools will suffer harm.
20Àá 13:21 Adversity pursues sinners, But the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity.
20Àá 13:22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.
20Àá 13:23 Abundant food [is in] the fallow ground of the poor, But it is swept away by injustice.
20Àá 13:24 He who spares his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him diligently.
20Àá 13:25 The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, But the stomach of the wicked is in want.
20Àá 14:1 The wise woman builds her house, But the foolish tears it down with her own hands.
20Àá 14:2 He who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD, But he who is crooked in his ways despises Him.
20Àá 14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for [his] back, But the lips of the wise will preserve them.
20Àá 14:4 Where no oxen are, the manger is clean, But much increase [comes] by the strength of the ox.
20Àá 14:5 A faithful witness will not lie, But a false witness speaks lies.
20Àá 14:6 A scoffer seeks wisdom, and [finds] none, But knowledge is easy to him who has understanding.
20Àá 14:7 Leave the presence of a fool, Or you will not discern words of knowledge.
20Àá 14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way, But the folly of fools is deceit.
20Àá 14:9 Fools mock at sin, But among the upright there is good will.
20Àá 14:10 The heart knows its own bitterness, And a stranger does not share its joy.
20Àá 14:11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed, But the tent of the upright will flourish.
20Àá 14:12 There is a way [which seems] right to a man, But its end is the way of death.
20Àá 14:13 Even in laughter the heart may be in pain, And the end of joy may be grief.
20Àá 14:14 The backslider in heart will have his fill of his own ways, But a good man will [be satisfied] with his.
20Àá 14:15 The naive believes everything, But the prudent man considers his steps.
20Àá 14:16 A wise man is cautious and turns away from evil, But a fool is arrogant and careless.
20Àá 14:17 A quick-tempered man acts foolishly, And a man of evil devices is hated.
20Àá 14:18 The naive inherit folly, But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
20Àá 14:19 The evil will bow down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
20Àá 14:20 The poor is hated even by his neighbor, But those who love the rich are many.
20Àá 14:21 He who despises his neighbor sins, But happy is he who is gracious to the poor.
20Àá 14:22 Will they not go astray who devise evil? But kindness and truth [will be to] those who devise good.
20Àá 14:23 In all labor there is profit, But mere talk [leads] only to poverty.
20Àá 14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches, [But] the folly of fools is foolishness.
20Àá 14:25 A truthful witness saves lives, But he who speaks lies is treacherous.
20Àá 14:26 In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, And his children will have refuge.
20Àá 14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, That one may avoid the snares of death.
20Àá 14:28 In a multitude of people is a king's glory, But in the dearth of people is a prince's ruin.
20Àá 14:29 He who is slow to anger has great understanding, But he who is quick-tempered exalts folly.
20Àá 14:30 A tranquil heart is life to the body, But passion is rottenness to the bones.
20Àá 14:31 He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker, But he who is gracious to the needy honors Him.
20Àá 14:32 The wicked is thrust down by his wrongdoing, But the righteous has a refuge when he dies.
20Àá 14:33 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, But in the bosom of fools it is made known.
20Àá 14:34 Righteousness exalts a nation, But sin is a disgrace to [any] people.
20Àá 14:35 The king's favor is toward a servant who acts wisely, But his anger is toward him who acts shamefully.
20Àá 15:1 A gentle answer turns away wrath, But a harsh word stirs up anger.
20Àá 15:2 The tongue of the wise makes knowledge acceptable, But the mouth of fools spouts folly.
20Àá 15:3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Watching the evil and the good.
20Àá 15:4 A soothing tongue is a tree of life, But perversion in it crushes the spirit.
20Àá 15:5 A fool rejects his father's discipline, But he who regards reproof is prudent.
20Àá 15:6 Much wealth is [in] the house of the righteous, But trouble is in the income of the wicked.
20Àá 15:7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge, But the hearts of fools are not so.
20Àá 15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, But the prayer of the upright is His delight.
20Àá 15:9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, But He loves him who pursues righteousness.
20Àá 15:10 Stern discipline is for him who forsakes the way; He who hates reproof will die.
20Àá 15:11 Sheol and Abaddon [lie open] before the LORD, How much more the hearts of men!
20Àá 15:12 A scoffer does not love one who reproves him, He will not go to the wise.
20Àá 15:13 A joyful heart makes a cheerful face, But when the heart is sad, the spirit is broken.
20Àá 15:14 The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.
20Àá 15:15 All the days of the afflicted are bad, But a cheerful heart [has] a continual feast.
20Àá 15:16 Better is a little with the fear of the LORD, Than great treasure and turmoil with it.
20Àá 15:17 Better is a dish of vegetables where love is, Than a fattened ox and hatred with it.
20Àá 15:18 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, But the slow to anger pacifies contention.
20Àá 15:19 The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns, But the path of the upright is a highway.
20Àá 15:20 A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother.
20Àá 15:21 Folly is joy to him who lacks sense, But a man of understanding walks straight.
20Àá 15:22 Without consultation, plans are frustrated, But with many counselors they succeed.
20Àá 15:23 A man has joy in an apt answer, And how delightful is a timely word!
20Àá 15:24 The path of life [leads] upward for the wise, That he may keep away from Sheol below.
20Àá 15:25 The LORD will tear down the house of the proud, But He will establish the boundary of the widow.
20Àá 15:26 Evil plans are an abomination to the LORD, But pleasant words are pure.
20Àá 15:27 He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, But he who hates bribes will live.
20Àá 15:28 The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.
20Àá 15:29 The LORD is far from the wicked, But He hears the prayer of the righteous.
20Àá 15:30 Bright eyes gladden the heart; Good news puts fat on the bones.
20Àá 15:31 He whose ear listens to the life-giving reproof Will dwell among the wise.
20Àá 15:32 He who neglects discipline despises himself, But he who listens to reproof acquires understanding.
20Àá 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction for wisdom, And before honor [comes] humility.
20Àá 16:1 The plans of the heart belong to man, But the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.
20Àá 16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, But the LORD weighs the motives.
20Àá 16:3 Commit your works to the LORD, And your plans will be established.
20Àá 16:4 The LORD has made everything for its own purpose, Even the wicked for the day of evil.
20Àá 16:5 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; Assuredly, he will not be unpunished.
20Àá 16:6 By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.
20Àá 16:7 When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
20Àá 16:8 Better is a little with righteousness Than great income with injustice.
20Àá 16:9 The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.
20Àá 16:10 A divine decision is in the lips of the king; His mouth should not err in judgment.
20Àá 16:11 A just balance and scales belong to the LORD; All the weights of the bag are His concern.
20Àá 16:12 It is an abomination for kings to commit wickedness, For a throne is established on righteousness.
20Àá 16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And he who speaks right is loved.
20Àá 16:14 The wrath of a king is [as] messengers of death, But a wise man will appease it.
20Àá 16:15 In the light of a king's face is life, And his favor is like a cloud with the spring rain.
20Àá 16:16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver.
20Àá 16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; He who watches his way preserves his life.
20Àá 16:18 Pride [goes] before destruction, And a haughty spirit before stumbling.
20Àá 16:19 It is better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
20Àá 16:20 He who gives attention to the word shall find good, And blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.
20Àá 16:21 The wise in heart will be called discerning, And sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness.
20Àá 16:22 Understanding is a fountain of life to him who has it, But the discipline of fools is folly.
20Àá 16:23 The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, And adds persuasiveness to his lips.
20Àá 16:24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
20Àá 16:25 There is a way [which seems] right to a man, But its end is the way of death.
20Àá 16:26 A worker's appetite works for him, For his hunger urges him [on.]
20Àá 16:27 A worthless man digs up evil, While his words are as a scorching fire.
20Àá 16:28 A perverse man spreads strife, And a slanderer separates intimate friends.
20Àá 16:29 A man of violence entices his neighbor, And leads him in a way that is not good.
20Àá 16:30 He who winks his eyes [does so] to devise perverse things; He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.
20Àá 16:31 A gray head is a crown of glory; It is found in the way of righteousness.
20Àá 16:32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit, than he who captures a city.
20Àá 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision is from the LORD.
20Àá 17:1 Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it Than a house full of feasting with strife.
20Àá 17:2 A servant who acts wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully, And will share in the inheritance among brothers.
20Àá 17:3 The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, But the LORD tests hearts.
20Àá 17:4 An evildoer listens to wicked lips, A liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.
20Àá 17:5 He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.
20Àá 17:6 Grandchildren are the crown of old men, And the glory of sons is their fathers.
20Àá 17:7 Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool; Much less are lying lips to a prince.
20Àá 17:8 A bribe is a charm in the sight of its owner; Wherever he turns, he prospers.
20Àá 17:9 He who covers a transgression seeks love, But he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends.
20Àá 17:10 A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding Than a hundred blows into a fool.
20Àá 17:11 A rebellious man seeks only evil, So a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
20Àá 17:12 Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs, Rather than a fool in his folly.
20Àá 17:13 He who returns evil for good, Evil will not depart from his house.
20Àá 17:14 The beginning of strife is [like] letting out water, So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.
20Àá 17:15 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.
20Àá 17:16 Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, When he has no sense?
20Àá 17:17 A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.
20Àá 17:18 A man lacking in sense pledges, And becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.
20Àá 17:19 He who loves transgression loves strife; He who raises his door seeks destruction.
20Àá 17:20 He who has a crooked mind finds no good, And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil.
20Àá 17:21 He who begets a fool [does so] to his sorrow, And the father of a fool has no joy.
20Àá 17:22 A joyful heart is good medicine, But a broken spirit dries up the bones.
20Àá 17:23 A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosom To pervert the ways of justice.
20Àá 17:24 Wisdom is in the presence of the one who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.
20Àá 17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him.
20Àá 17:26 It is also not good to fine the righteous, [Nor] to strike the noble for [their] uprightness.
20Àá 17:27 He who restrains his words has knowledge, And he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
20Àá 17:28 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise; When he closes his lips, he is [counted] prudent.
20Àá 18:1 He who separates himself seeks [his own] desire, He quarrels against all sound wisdom.
20Àá 18:2 A fool does not delight in understanding, But only in revealing his own mind.
20Àá 18:3 When a wicked man comes, contempt also comes, And with dishonor [comes] reproach.
20Àá 18:4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.
20Àá 18:5 To show partiality to the wicked is not good, [Nor] to thrust aside the righteous in judgment.
20Àá 18:6 A fool's lips bring strife, And his mouth calls for blows.
20Àá 18:7 A fool's mouth is his ruin, And his lips are the snare of his soul.
20Àá 18:8 The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
20Àá 18:9 He also who is slack in his work Is brother to him who destroys.
20Àá 18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it and is safe.
20Àá 18:11 A rich man's wealth is his strong city, And like a high wall in his own imagination.
20Àá 18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, But humility [goes] before honor.
20Àá 18:13 He who gives an answer before he hears, It is folly and shame to him.
20Àá 18:14 The spirit of a man can endure his sickness, But a broken spirit who can bear?
20Àá 18:15 The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.
20Àá 18:16 A man's gift makes room for him, And brings him before great men.
20Àá 18:17 The first to plead his case [seems] just, [Until] another comes and examines him.
20Àá 18:18 The lot puts an end to contentions, And decides between the mighty.
20Àá 18:19 A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city, And contentions are like the bars of a castle.
20Àá 18:20 With the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach will be satisfied; He will be satisfied [with] the product of his lips.
20Àá 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit.
20Àá 18:22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favor from the LORD.
20Àá 18:23 The poor man utters supplications, But the rich man answers roughly.
20Àá 18:24 A man of [many] friends [comes] to ruin, But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
20Àá 19:1 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity Than he who is perverse in speech and is a fool.
20Àá 19:2 Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, And he who makes haste with his feet errs.
20Àá 19:3 The foolishness of man subverts his way, And his heart rages against the LORD.
20Àá 19:4 Wealth adds many friends, But a poor man is separated from his friend.
20Àá 19:5 A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who tells lies will not escape.
20Àá 19:6 Many will entreat the favor of a generous man, And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.
20Àá 19:7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues [them with] words, [but] they are gone.
20Àá 19:8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good.
20Àá 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who tells lies will perish.
20Àá 19:10 Luxury is not fitting for a fool; Much less for a slave to rule over princes.
20Àá 19:11 A man's discretion makes him slow to anger, And it is his glory to overlook a transgression.
20Àá 19:12 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, But his favor is like dew on the grass.
20Àá 19:13 A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the contentions of a wife are a constant dripping.
20Àá 19:14 House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD.
20Àá 19:15 Laziness casts into a deep sleep, And an idle man will suffer hunger.
20Àá 19:16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, [But] he who is careless of his ways will die.
20Àá 19:17 He who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, And He will repay him for his good deed.
20Àá 19:18 Discipline your son while there is hope, And do not desire his death.
20Àá 19:19 [A man of] great anger shall bear the penalty, For if you rescue [ him,] you will only have to do it again.
20Àá 19:20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline, That you may be wise the rest of your days.
20Àá 19:21 Many are the plans in a man's heart, But the counsel of the LORD, it will stand.
20Àá 19:22 What is desirable in a man is his kindness, And [it is] better to be a poor man than a liar.
20Àá 19:23 The fear of the LORD [leads] to life, So that one may sleep satisfied, untouched by evil.
20Àá 19:24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, [And] will not even bring it back to his mouth.
20Àá 19:25 Strike a scoffer and the naive may become shrewd, But reprove one who has understanding and he will gain knowledge.
20Àá 19:26 He who assaults [his] father [and] drives [his] mother away Is a shameful and disgraceful son.
20Àá 19:27 Cease listening, my son, to discipline, [And you will] stray from the words of knowledge.
20Àá 19:28 A rascally witness makes a mockery of justice, And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity.
20Àá 19:29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And blows for the back of fools.
20Àá 20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise.
20Àá 20:2 The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion; He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
20Àá 20:3 Keeping away from strife is an honor for a man, But any fool will quarrel.
20Àá 20:4 The sluggard does not plow after the autumn, So he begs during the harvest and has nothing.
20Àá 20:5 A plan in the heart of a man is [like] deep water, But a man of understanding draws it out.
20Àá 20:6 Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, But who can find a trustworthy man?
20Àá 20:7 A righteous man who walks in his integrity-- How blessed are his sons after him.
20Àá 20:8 A king who sits on the throne of justice Disperses all evil with his eyes.
20Àá 20:9 Who can say, "I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin"?
20Àá 20:10 Differing weights and differing measures, Both of them are abominable to the LORD.
20Àá 20:11 It is by his deeds that a lad distinguishes himself If his conduct is pure and right.
20Àá 20:12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye, The LORD has made both of them.
20Àá 20:13 Do not love sleep, lest you become poor; Open your eyes, [and] you will be satisfied with food.
20Àá 20:14 "Bad, bad," says the buyer; But when he goes his way, then he boasts.
20Àá 20:15 There is gold, and an abundance of jewels; But the lips of knowledge are a more precious thing.
20Àá 20:16 Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger; And for foreigners, hold him in pledge.
20Àá 20:17 Bread obtained by falsehood is sweet to a man, But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.
20Àá 20:18 Prepare plans by consultation, And make war by wise guidance.
20Àá 20:19 He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets, Therefore do not associate with a gossip.
20Àá 20:20 He who curses his father or his mother, His lamp will go out in time of darkness.
20Àá 20:21 An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning, Will not be blessed in the end.
20Àá 20:22 Do not say, "I will repay evil"; Wait for the LORD, and He will save you.
20Àá 20:23 Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD, And a false scale is not good.
20Àá 20:24 Man's steps are [ordained] by the LORD, How then can man understand his way?
20Àá 20:25 It is a snare for a man to say rashly, "It is holy!" And after the vows to make inquiry.
20Àá 20:26 A wise king winnows the wicked, And drives the [threshing] wheel over them.
20Àá 20:27 The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the innermost parts of his being.
20Àá 20:28 Loyalty and truth preserve the king, And he upholds his throne by righteousness.
20Àá 20:29 The glory of young men is their strength, And the honor of old men is their gray hair.
20Àá 20:30 Stripes that wound scour away evil, And strokes [reach] the innermost parts.
20Àá 21:1 The king's heart is [like] channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He wishes.
20Àá 21:2 Every man's way is right in his own eyes, But the LORD weighs the hearts.
20Àá 21:3 To do righteousness and justice Is desired by the LORD rather than sacrifice.
20Àá 21:4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart, The lamp of the wicked, is sin.
20Àá 21:5 The plans of the diligent [lead] surely to advantage, But everyone who is hasty [comes] surely to poverty.
20Àá 21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a fleeting vapor, the pursuit of death.
20Àá 21:7 The violence of the wicked will drag them away, Because they refuse to act with justice.
20Àá 21:8 The way of a guilty man is crooked, But as for the pure, his conduct is upright.
20Àá 21:9 It is better to live in a corner of a roof, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
20Àá 21:10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
20Àá 21:11 When the scoffer is punished, the naive becomes wise; But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
20Àá 21:12 The righteous one considers the house of the wicked, Turning the wicked to ruin.
20Àá 21:13 He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor Will also cry himself and not be answered.
20Àá 21:14 A gift in secret subdues anger, And a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.
20Àá 21:15 The execution of justice is joy for the righteous, But is terror to the workers of iniquity.
20Àá 21:16 A man who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest in the assembly of the dead.
20Àá 21:17 He who loves pleasure [will become] a poor man; He who loves wine and oil will not become rich.
20Àá 21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, And the treacherous is in the place of the upright.
20Àá 21:19 It is better to live in a desert land, Than with a contentious and vexing woman.
20Àá 21:20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.
20Àá 21:21 He who pursues righteousness and loyalty Finds life, righteousness and honor.
20Àá 21:22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, And brings down the stronghold in which they trust.
20Àá 21:23 He who guards his mouth and his tongue, Guards his soul from troubles.
20Àá 21:24 "Proud," "Haughty," "Scoffer," are his names, Who acts with insolent pride.
20Àá 21:25 The desire of the sluggard puts him to death, For his hands refuse to work;
20Àá 21:26 All day long he is craving, While the righteous gives and does not hold back.
20Àá 21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, How much more when he brings it with evil intent!
20Àá 21:28 A false witness will perish, But the man who listens [to the truth] will speak forever.
20Àá 21:29 A wicked man shows a bold face, But as for the upright, he makes his way sure.
20Àá 21:30 There is no wisdom and no understanding And no counsel against the LORD.
20Àá 21:31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle, But victory belongs to the LORD.
20Àá 22:1 A [good] name is to be more desired than great riches, Favor is better than silver and gold.
20Àá 22:2 The rich and the poor have a common bond, The LORD is the maker of them all.
20Àá 22:3 The prudent sees the evil and hides himself, But the naive go on, and are punished for it.
20Àá 22:4 The reward of humility [and] the fear of the LORD Are riches, honor and life.
20Àá 22:5 Thorns [and] snares are in the way of the perverse; He who guards himself will be far from them.
20Àá 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old he will not depart from it.
20Àá 22:7 The rich rules over the poor, And the borrower [becomes] the lender's slave.
20Àá 22:8 He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his fury will perish.
20Àá 22:9 He who is generous will be blessed, For he gives some of his food to the poor.
20Àá 22:10 Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go out, Even strife and dishonor will cease.
20Àá 22:11 He who loves purity of heart [And] whose speech is gracious, the king is his friend.
20Àá 22:12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, But He overthrows the words of the treacherous man.
20Àá 22:13 The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside; I shall be slain in the streets!"
20Àá 22:14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; He who is cursed of the LORD will fall into it.
20Àá 22:15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him.
20Àá 22:16 He who oppresses the poor to make much for himself Or who gives to the rich, [will] only [come to] poverty.
20Àá 22:17 Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise, And apply your mind to my knowledge;
20Àá 22:18 For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, That they may be ready on your lips.
20Àá 22:19 So that your trust may be in the LORD, I have taught you today, even you.
20Àá 22:20 Have I not written to you excellent things Of counsels and knowledge,
20Àá 22:21 To make you know the certainty of the words of truth That you may correctly answer to him who sent you?
20Àá 22:22 Do not rob the poor because he is poor, Or crush the afflicted at the gate;
20Àá 22:23 For the LORD will plead their case, And take the life of those who rob them.
20Àá 22:24 Do not associate with a man [given] to anger; Or go with a hot-tempered man,
20Àá 22:25 Lest you learn his ways, And find a snare for yourself.
20Àá 22:26 Do not be among those who give pledges, Among those who become sureties for debts.
20Àá 22:27 If you have nothing with which to pay, Why should he take your bed from under you?
20Àá 22:28 Do not move the ancient boundary Which your fathers have set.
20Àá 22:29 Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before obscure men.
20Àá 23:1 When you sit down to dine with a ruler, Consider carefully what is before you;
20Àá 23:2 And put a knife to your throat, If you are a man of [great] appetite.
20Àá 23:3 Do not desire his delicacies, For it is deceptive food.
20Àá 23:4 Do not weary yourself to gain wealth, Cease from your consideration [of it.]
20Àá 23:5 When you set your eyes on it, it is gone. For [wealth] certainly makes itself wings, Like an eagle that flies [toward] the heavens.
20Àá 23:6 Do not eat the bread of a selfish man, Or desire his delicacies;
20Àá 23:7 For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, "Eat and drink!" But his heart is not with you.
20Àá 23:8 You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten, And waste your compliments.
20Àá 23:9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words.
20Àá 23:10 Do not move the ancient boundary, Or go into the fields of the fatherless;
20Àá 23:11 For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their case against you.
20Àá 23:12 Apply your heart to discipline, And your ears to words of knowledge.
20Àá 23:13 Do not hold back discipline from the child, Although you beat him with the rod, he will not die.
20Àá 23:14 You shall beat him with the rod, And deliver his soul from Sheol.
20Àá 23:15 My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be glad;
20Àá 23:16 And my inmost being will rejoice, When your lips speak what is right.
20Àá 23:17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, But [live] in the fear of the LORD always.
20Àá 23:18 Surely there is a future, And your hope will not be cut off.
20Àá 23:19 Listen, my son, and be wise, And direct your heart in the way.
20Àá 23:20 Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine, [Or] with gluttonous eaters of meat;
20Àá 23:21 For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags.
20Àá 23:22 Listen to your father who begot you, And do not despise your mother when she is old.
20Àá 23:23 Buy truth, and do not sell [it,] [Get] wisdom and instruction and understanding.
20Àá 23:24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who begets a wise son will be glad in him.
20Àá 23:25 Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her rejoice who gave birth to you.
20Àá 23:26 Give me your heart, my son, And let your eyes delight in my ways.
20Àá 23:27 For a harlot is a deep pit, And an adulterous woman is a narrow well.
20Àá 23:28 Surely she lurks as a robber, And increases the faithless among men.
20Àá 23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
20Àá 23:30 Those who linger long over wine, Those who go to taste mixed wine.
20Àá 23:31 Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, When it goes down smoothly;
20Àá 23:32 At the last it bites like a serpent, And stings like a viper.
20Àá 23:33 Your eyes will see strange things, And your mind will utter perverse things.
20Àá 23:34 And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea, Or like one who lies down on the top of a mast.
20Àá 23:35 "They struck me, [but] I did not become ill; They beat me, [but] I did not know [it.] When shall I awake? I will seek another drink."
20Àá 24:1 Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with them;
20Àá 24:2 For their minds devise violence, And their lips talk of trouble.
20Àá 24:3 By wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established;
20Àá 24:4 And by knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches.
20Àá 24:5 A wise man is strong, And a man of knowledge increases power.
20Àá 24:6 For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of counselors there is victory.
20Àá 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool, He does not open his mouth in the gate.
20Àá 24:8 He who plans to do evil, Men will call him a schemer.
20Àá 24:9 The devising of folly is sin, And the scoffer is an abomination to men.
20Àá 24:10 If you are slack in the day of distress, Your strength is limited.
20Àá 24:11 Deliver those who are being taken away to death, And those who are staggering to slaughter, O hold [them] back.
20Àá 24:12 If you say, "See, we did not know this," Does He not consider [it] who weighs the hearts? And does He not know [it] who keeps your soul? And will He not render to man according to his work?
20Àá 24:13 My son, eat honey, for it is good, Yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste;
20Àá 24:14 Know [that] wisdom is thus for your soul; If you find [it,] then there will be a future, And your hope will not be cut off.
20Àá 24:15 Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not destroy his resting place;
20Àá 24:16 For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again, But the wicked stumble in [time of] calamity.
20Àá 24:17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
20Àá 24:18 Lest the LORD see [it] and be displeased, And He turn away His anger from him.
20Àá 24:19 Do not fret because of evildoers, Or be envious of the wicked;
20Àá 24:20 For there will be no future for the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out.
20Àá 24:21 My son, fear the LORD and the king; Do not associate with those who are given to change;
20Àá 24:22 For their calamity will rise suddenly, And who knows the ruin [that comes] from both of them?
20Àá 24:23 These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good.
20Àá 24:24 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous," Peoples will curse him, nations will abhor him;
20Àá 24:25 But to those who rebuke the [wicked] will be delight, And a good blessing will come upon them.
20Àá 24:26 He kisses the lips Who gives a right answer.
20Àá 24:27 Prepare your work outside, And make it ready for yourself in the field; Afterwards, then, build your house.
20Àá 24:28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, And do not deceive with your lips.
20Àá 24:29 Do not say, "Thus I shall do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work."
20Àá 24:30 I passed by the field of the sluggard, And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense;
20Àá 24:31 And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles, Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down.
20Àá 24:32 When I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, [and] received instruction.
20Àá 24:33 "A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest,"
20Àá 24:34 Then your poverty will come [as] a robber, And your want like an armed man.
20Àá 25:1 These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, transcribed.
20Àá 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
20Àá 25:3 [As] the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
20Àá 25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, And there comes out a vessel for the smith;
20Àá 25:5 Take away the wicked [from] before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness.
20Àá 25:6 Do not claim honor in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of great men;
20Àá 25:7 For it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here," Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen.
20Àá 25:8 Do not go out hastily to argue [your case;] Otherwise, what will you do in the end, When your neighbor puts you to shame?
20Àá 25:9 Argue your case with your neighbor, And do not reveal the secret of another,
20Àá 25:10 Lest he who hears [it] reproach you, And the evil report about you not pass away.
20Àá 25:11 [Like] apples of gold in settings of silver Is a word spoken in right circumstances.
20Àá 25:12 [Like] an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold Is a wise reprover to a listening ear.
20Àá 25:13 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest Is a faithful messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the soul of his masters.
20Àá 25:14 [Like] clouds and wind without rain Is a man who boasts of his gifts falsely.
20Àá 25:15 By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, And a soft tongue breaks the bone.
20Àá 25:16 Have you found honey? Eat [only] what you need, Lest you have it in excess and vomit it.
20Àá 25:17 Let your foot rarely be in your neighbor's house, Lest he become weary of you and hate you.
20Àá 25:18 [Like] a club and a sword and a sharp arrow Is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor.
20Àá 25:19 [Like] a bad tooth and an unsteady foot Is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.
20Àá 25:20 [Like] one who takes off a garment on a cold day, [or like] vinegar on soda, Is he who sings songs to a troubled heart.
20Àá 25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
20Àá 25:22 For you will heap burning coals on his head, And the LORD will reward you.
20Àá 25:23 The north wind brings forth rain, And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance.
20Àá 25:24 It is better to live in a corner of the roof Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.
20Àá 25:25 [Like] cold water to a weary soul, So is good news from a distant land.
20Àá 25:26 [Like] a trampled spring and a polluted well Is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
20Àá 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey, Nor is it glory to search out one's own glory.
20Àá 25:28 [Like] a city that is broken into [and] without walls Is a man who has no control over his spirit.
20Àá 26:1 Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool.
20Àá 26:2 Like a sparrow in [its] flitting, like a swallow in [its] flying, So a curse without cause does not alight.
20Àá 26:3 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools.
20Àá 26:4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him.
20Àá 26:5 Answer a fool as his folly [deserves], Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
20Àá 26:6 He cuts off [his own] feet, [and] drinks violence Who sends a message by the hand of a fool.
20Àá 26:7 [Like] the legs [which] hang down from the lame, So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
20Àá 26:8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling, So is he who gives honor to a fool.
20Àá 26:9 [Like] a thorn [which] falls into the hand of a drunkard, So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
20Àá 26:10 [Like] an archer who wounds everyone, So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by.
20Àá 26:11 Like a dog that returns to its vomit Is a fool who repeats his folly.
20Àá 26:12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
20Àá 26:13 The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square!"
20Àá 26:14 [As] the door turns on its hinges, So [does] the sluggard on his bed.
20Àá 26:15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.
20Àá 26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can give a discreet answer.
20Àá 26:17 [Like] one who takes a dog by the ears Is he who passes by [and] meddles with strife not belonging to him.
20Àá 26:18 Like a madman who throws Firebrands, arrows and death,
20Àá 26:19 So is the man who deceives his neighbor, And says, "Was I not joking?"
20Àá 26:20 For lack of wood the fire goes out, And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.
20Àá 26:21 [Like] charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
20Àá 26:22 The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
20Àá 26:23 [Like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross Are burning lips and a wicked heart.
20Àá 26:24 He who hates disguises [it] with his lips, But he lays up deceit in his heart.
20Àá 26:25 When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, For there are seven abominations in his heart.
20Àá 26:26 [Though his] hatred covers itself with guile, His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.
20Àá 26:27 He who digs a pit will fall into it, And he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
20Àá 26:28 A lying tongue hates those it crushes, And a flattering mouth works ruin.
20Àá 27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth.
20Àá 27:2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips.
20Àá 27:3 A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them.
20Àá 27:4 Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand before jealousy?
20Àá 27:5 Better is open rebuke Than love that is concealed.
20Àá 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.
20Àá 27:7 A sated man loathes honey, But to a famished man any bitter thing is sweet.
20Àá 27:8 Like a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who wanders from his home.
20Àá 27:9 Oil and perfume make the heart glad, So a man's counsel is sweet to his friend.
20Àá 27:10 Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend, And do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity; Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away.
20Àá 27:11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, That I may reply to him who reproaches me.
20Àá 27:12 A prudent man sees evil [and] hides himself, The naive proceed [and] pay the penalty.
20Àá 27:13 Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger; And for an adulterous woman hold him in pledge.
20Àá 27:14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be reckoned a curse to him.
20Àá 27:15 A constant dripping on a day of steady rain And a contentious woman are alike;
20Àá 27:16 He who would restrain her restrains the wind, And grasps oil with his right hand.
20Àá 27:17 Iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens another.
20Àá 27:18 He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit; And he who cares for his master will be honored.
20Àá 27:19 As in water face [reflects] face, So the heart of man [reflects] man.
20Àá 27:20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied.
20Àá 27:21 The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold, And a man [is tested] by the praise accorded him.
20Àá 27:22 Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, [Yet] his folly will not depart from him.
20Àá 27:23 Know well the condition of your flocks, [And] pay attention to your herds;
20Àá 27:24 For riches are not forever, Nor does a crown [endure] to all generations.
20Àá 27:25 [When] the grass disappears, the new growth is seen, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in,
20Àá 27:26 The lambs [will be] for your clothing, And the goats [will bring] the price of a field,
20Àá 27:27 And [there will be] goats' milk enough for your food, For the food of your household, And sustenance for your maidens.
20Àá 28:1 The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, But the righteous are bold as a lion.
20Àá 28:2 By the transgression of a land many are its princes, But by a man of understanding [and] knowledge, so it endures.
20Àá 28:3 A poor man who oppresses the lowly Is [like] a driving rain which leaves no food.
20Àá 28:4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, But those who keep the law strive with them.
20Àá 28:5 Evil men do not understand justice, But those who seek the LORD understand all things.
20Àá 28:6 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, Than he who is crooked though he be rich.
20Àá 28:7 He who keeps the law is a discerning son, But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.
20Àá 28:8 He who increases his wealth by interest and usury, Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.
20Àá 28:9 He who turns away his ear from listening to the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.
20Àá 28:10 He who leads the upright astray in an evil way Will himself fall into his own pit, But the blameless will inherit good.
20Àá 28:11 The rich man is wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding sees through him.
20Àá 28:12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
20Àá 28:13 He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, But he who confesses and forsakes [them] will find compassion.
20Àá 28:14 How blessed is the man who fears always, But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
20Àá 28:15 [Like] a roaring lion and a rushing bear Is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
20Àá 28:16 A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding, [But] he who hates unjust gain will prolong [his] days.
20Àá 28:17 A man who is laden with the guilt of human blood Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him.
20Àá 28:18 He who walks blamelessly will be delivered, But he who is crooked will fall all at once.
20Àá 28:19 He who tills his land will have plenty of food, But he who follows empty [pursuits] will have poverty in plenty.
20Àá 28:20 A faithful man will abound with blessings, But he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished.
20Àá 28:21 To show partiality is not good, Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.
20Àá 28:22 A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth, And does not know that want will come upon him.
20Àá 28:23 He who rebukes a man will afterward find [more] favor Than he who flatters with the tongue.
20Àá 28:24 He who robs his father or his mother, And says, "It is not a transgression," Is the companion of a man who destroys.
20Àá 28:25 An arrogant man stirs up strife, But he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.
20Àá 28:26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But he who walks wisely will be delivered.
20Àá 28:27 He who gives to the poor will never want, But he who shuts his eyes will have many curses.
20Àá 28:28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
20Àá 29:1 A man who hardens [his] neck after much reproof Will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.
20Àá 29:2 When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, But when a wicked man rules, people groan.
20Àá 29:3 A man who loves wisdom makes his father glad, But he who keeps company with harlots wastes [his] wealth.
20Àá 29:4 The king gives stability to the land by justice, But a man who takes bribes overthrows it.
20Àá 29:5 A man who flatters his neighbor Is spreading a net for his steps.
20Àá 29:6 By transgression an evil man is ensnared, But the righteous sings and rejoices.
20Àá 29:7 The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor, The wicked does not understand [such] concern.
20Àá 29:8 Scorners set a city aflame, But wise men turn away anger.
20Àá 29:9 When a wise man has a controversy with a foolish man, The foolish man either rages or laughs, and there is no rest.
20Àá 29:10 Men of bloodshed hate the blameless, But the upright are concerned for his life.
20Àá 29:11 A fool always loses his temper, But a wise man holds it back.
20Àá 29:12 If a ruler pays attention to falsehood, All his ministers [become] wicked.
20Àá 29:13 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common£º The LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
20Àá 29:14 If a king judges the poor with truth, His throne will be established forever.
20Àá 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
20Àá 29:16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases; But the righteous will see their fall.
20Àá 29:17 Correct your son, and he will give you comfort; He will also delight your soul.
20Àá 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, But happy is he who keeps the law.
20Àá 29:19 A slave will not be instructed by words [alone;] For though he understands, there will be no response.
20Àá 29:20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
20Àá 29:21 He who pampers his slave from childhood Will in the end find him to be a son.
20Àá 29:22 An angry man stirs up strife, And a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
20Àá 29:23 A man's pride will bring him low, But a humble spirit will obtain honor.
20Àá 29:24 He who is a partner with a thief hates his own life; He hears the oath but tells nothing.
20Àá 29:25 The fear of man brings a snare, But he who trusts in the LORD will be exalted.
20Àá 29:26 Many seek the ruler's favor, But justice for man [comes] from the LORD.
20Àá 29:27 An unjust man is abominable to the righteous, And he who is upright in the way is abominable to the wicked.
20Àá 30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle. The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal£º
20Àá 30:2 Surely I am more stupid than any man, And I do not have the understanding of a man.
20Àá 30:3 Neither have I learned wisdom, Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.
20Àá 30:4 Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has wrapped the waters in His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name or His son's name? Surely you know!
20Àá 30:5 Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
20Àá 30:6 Do not add to His words Lest He reprove you, and you be proved a liar.
20Àá 30:7 Two things I asked of Thee, Do not refuse me before I die£º
20Àá 30:8 Keep deception and lies far from me, Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is my portion,
20Àá 30:9 Lest I be full and deny [Thee] and say, "Who is the LORD?" Or lest I be in want and steal, And profane the name of my God.
20Àá 30:10 Do not slander a slave to his master, Lest he curse you and you be found guilty.
20Àá 30:11 There is a kind of [man] who curses his father, And does not bless his mother.
20Àá 30:12 There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not washed from his filthiness.
20Àá 30:13 There is a kind-- oh how lofty are his eyes! And his eyelids are raised [in arrogance.]
20Àá 30:14 There is a kind of [man] whose teeth are [like] swords, And his jaw teeth [like] knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth, And the needy from among men.
20Àá 30:15 The leech has two daughters, "Give," "Give." There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say, "Enough"£º
20Àá 30:16 Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is never satisfied with water, And fire that never says, "Enough."
20Àá 30:17 The eye that mocks a father, And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.
20Àá 30:18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Four which I do not understand£º
20Àá 30:19 The way of an eagle in the sky, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the middle of the sea, And the way of a man with a maid.
20Àá 30:20 This is the way of an adulterous woman£º She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wrong."
20Àá 30:21 Under three things the earth quakes, And under four, it cannot bear up£º
20Àá 30:22 Under a slave when he becomes king, And a fool when he is satisfied with food,
20Àá 30:23 Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband, And a maidservant when she supplants her mistress.
20Àá 30:24 Four things are small on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise£º
20Àá 30:25 The ants are not a strong folk, But they prepare their food in the summer;
20Àá 30:26 The badgers are not mighty folk, Yet they make their houses in the rocks;
20Àá 30:27 The locusts have no king, Yet all of them go out in ranks;
20Àá 30:28 The lizard you may grasp with the hands, Yet it is in kings' palaces.
20Àá 30:29 There are three things which are stately in [their] march, Even four which are stately when they walk£º
20Àá 30:30 The lion [which] is mighty among beasts And does not retreat before any,
20Àá 30:31 The strutting cock, the male goat also, And a king [when his] army is with him.
20Àá 30:32 If you have been foolish in exalting yourself Or if you have plotted [evil, put your] hand on your mouth.
20Àá 30:33 For the churning of milk produces butter, And pressing the nose brings forth blood; So the churning of anger produces strife.
20Àá 31:1 The words of King Lemuel, the oracle which his mother taught him.
20Àá 31:2 What, O my son? And what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?
20Àá 31:3 Do not give your strength to women, Or your ways to that which destroys kings.
20Àá 31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Or for rulers to desire strong drink,
20Àá 31:5 Lest they drink and forget what is decreed, And pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
20Àá 31:6 Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to him whose life is bitter.
20Àá 31:7 Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his trouble no more.
20Àá 31:8 Open your mouth for the dumb, For the rights of all the unfortunate.
20Àá 31:9 Open your mouth, judge righteously, And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.
20Àá 31:10 An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above jewels.
20Àá 31:11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain.
20Àá 31:12 She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.
20Àá 31:13 She looks for wool and flax, And works with her hands in delight.
20Àá 31:14 She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar.
20Àá 31:15 She rises also while it is still night, And gives food to her household, And portions to her maidens.
20Àá 31:16 She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard.
20Àá 31:17 She girds herself with strength, And makes her arms strong.
20Àá 31:18 She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night.
20Àá 31:19 She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle.
20Àá 31:20 She extends her hand to the poor; And she stretches out her hands to the needy.
20Àá 31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
20Àá 31:22 She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
20Àá 31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.
20Àá 31:24 She makes linen garments and sells [them,] And supplies belts to the tradesmen.
20Àá 31:25 Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future.
20Àá 31:26 She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
20Àá 31:27 She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.
20Àá 31:28 Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband [also,] and he praises her, [saying:]
20Àá 31:29 "Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all."
20Àá 31:30 Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, [But] a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.
20Àá 31:31 Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.

21Àü 1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21Àü 1:2 "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "Vanity of vanities! All is vanity."
21Àü 1:3 What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun?
21Àü 1:4 A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever.
21Àü 1:5 Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there [again.]
21Àü 1:6 Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns.
21Àü 1:7 All the rivers flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again.
21Àü 1:8 All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell [it.] The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing.
21Àü 1:9 That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So, there is nothing new under the sun.
21Àü 1:10 Is there anything of which one might say, "See this, it is new"? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us.
21Àü 1:11 There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur, There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later [still.]
21Àü 1:12 I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21Àü 1:13 And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. [It] is a grievous task [which] God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
21Àü 1:14 I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.
21Àü 1:15 What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
21Àü 1:16 I said to myself, "Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge."
21Àü 1:17 And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.
21Àü 1:18 Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge [results in] increasing pain.
21Àü 2:1 I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself." And behold, it too was futility.
21Àü 2:2 I said of laughter, "It is madness," and of pleasure, "What does it accomplish?"
21Àü 2:3 I explored with my mind [how] to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding [me] wisely, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives.
21Àü 2:4 I enlarged my works£º I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself;
21Àü 2:5 I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees;
21Àü 2:6 I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
21Àü 2:7 I bought male and female slaves, and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
21Àü 2:8 Also, I collected for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men-- many concubines.
21Àü 2:9 Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me.
21Àü 2:10 And all that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor.
21Àü 2:11 Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.
21Àü 2:12 So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly, for what [will] the man [do] who will come after the king [except] what has already been done?
21Àü 2:13 And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
21Àü 2:14 The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both.
21Àü 2:15 Then I said to myself, "As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?" So I said to myself, "This too is vanity."
21Àü 2:16 For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man [as] with the fool, inasmuch as [in] the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die!
21Àü 2:17 So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind.
21Àü 2:18 Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me.
21Àü 2:19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity.
21Àü 2:20 Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun.
21Àü 2:21 When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil.
21Àü 2:22 For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun?
21Àü 2:23 Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.
21Àü 2:24 There is nothing better for a man [than] to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen, that it is from the hand of God.
21Àü 2:25 For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him?
21Àü 2:26 For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God's sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
21Àü 3:1 There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven--
21Àü 3:2 A time to give birth, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted.
21Àü 3:3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to tear down, and a time to build up.
21Àü 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
21Àü 3:5 A time to throw stones, and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace, and a time to shun embracing.
21Àü 3:6 A time to search, and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep, and a time to throw away.
21Àü 3:7 A time to tear apart, and a time to sew together; A time to be silent, and a time to speak.
21Àü 3:8 A time to love, and a time to hate; A time for war, and a time for peace.
21Àü 3:9 What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils?
21Àü 3:10 I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.
21Àü 3:11 He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.
21Àü 3:12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime;
21Àü 3:13 moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor-- it is the gift of God.
21Àü 3:14 I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has [so] worked that men should fear Him.
21Àü 3:15 That which is has been already, and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by.
21Àü 3:16 Furthermore, I have seen under the sun [that] in the place of justice there is wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness.
21Àü 3:17 I said to myself, "God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man," for a time for every matter and for every deed is there.
21Àü 3:18 I said to myself concerning the sons of men, "God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts."
21Àü 3:19 For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity.
21Àü 3:20 All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust.
21Àü 3:21 Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?
21Àü 3:22 And I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?
21Àü 4:1 Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold [I saw] the tears of the oppressed and [that] they had no one to comfort [them;] and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort [them.]
21Àü 4:2 So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.
21Àü 4:3 But better [off] than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.
21Àü 4:4 And I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is [ the result of] rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
21Àü 4:5 The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
21Àü 4:6 One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.
21Àü 4:7 Then I looked again at vanity under the sun.
21Àü 4:8 There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches [and he never asked,] "And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?" This too is vanity and it is a grievous task.
21Àü 4:9 Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
21Àü 4:10 For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up.
21Àü 4:11 Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm [alone?]
21Àü 4:12 And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three [strands] is not quickly torn apart.
21Àü 4:13 A poor, yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows [how] to receive instruction.
21Àü 4:14 For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
21Àü 4:15 I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him.
21Àü 4:16 There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind.
21Àü 5:1 Guard your steps as you go to the house of God, and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil.
21Àü 5:2 Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.
21Àü 5:3 For the dream comes through much effort, and the voice of a fool through many words.
21Àü 5:4 When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it, for [He takes] no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!
21Àü 5:5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
21Àü 5:6 Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger [of God] that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
21Àü 5:7 For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God.
21Àü 5:8 If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight, for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them.
21Àü 5:9 After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land.
21Àü 5:10 He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance [with its] income. This too is vanity.
21Àü 5:11 When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?
21Àü 5:12 The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much. But the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.
21Àü 5:13 There is a grievous evil [which] I have seen under the sun£º riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt.
21Àü 5:14 When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him.
21Àü 5:15 As he had come naked from his mother's womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.
21Àü 5:16 And this also is a grievous evil-- exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So, what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?
21Àü 5:17 Throughout his life [he] also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger.
21Àü 5:18 Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting£º to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun [ during] the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward.
21Àü 5:19 Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.
21Àü 5:20 For he will not often consider the years of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart.
21Àü 6:1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men--
21Àü 6:2 a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires, but God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction.
21Àü 6:3 If a man fathers a hundred [children] and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things, and he does not even have a [proper] burial, [then] I say, "Better the miscarriage than he,
21Àü 6:4 for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity.
21Àü 6:5 "It never sees the sun and it never knows [anything;] it is better off than he.
21Àü 6:6 "Even if the [other] man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things-- do not all go to one place?"
21Àü 6:7 All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied.
21Àü 6:8 For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What [advantage] does the poor man have, knowing [how] to walk before the living?
21Àü 6:9 What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.
21Àü 6:10 Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is.
21Àü 6:11 For there are many words which increase futility. What [then] is the advantage to a man?
21Àü 6:12 For who knows what is good for a man during [his] lifetime, [during] the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
21Àü 7:1 A good name is better than a good ointment, And the day of [one's] death is better than the day of one's birth.
21Àü 7:2 It is better to go to a house of mourning Than to go to a house of feasting, Because that is the end of every man, And the living takes [it] to heart.
21Àü 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad a heart may be happy.
21Àü 7:4 The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.
21Àü 7:5 It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools.
21Àü 7:6 For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool, And this too is futility.
21Àü 7:7 For oppression makes a wise man mad, And a bribe corrupts the heart.
21Àü 7:8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.
21Àü 7:9 Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger resides in the bosom of fools.
21Àü 7:10 Do not say, "Why is it that the former days were better than these?" For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this.
21Àü 7:11 Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun.
21Àü 7:12 For wisdom is protection [just as] money is protection. But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors.
21Àü 7:13 Consider the work of God, For who is able to straighten what He has bent?
21Àü 7:14 In the day of prosperity be happy, But in the day of adversity consider-- God has made the one as well as the other So that man may not discover anything [that will be] after him.
21Àü 7:15 I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs [his life] in his wickedness.
21Àü 7:16 Do not be excessively righteous, and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself?
21Àü 7:17 Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
21Àü 7:18 It is good that you grasp one thing, and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them.
21Àü 7:19 Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
21Àü 7:20 Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who [continually] does good and who never sins.
21Àü 7:21 Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.
21Àü 7:22 For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others.
21Àü 7:23 I tested all this with wisdom, [and] I said, "I will be wise," but it was far from me.
21Àü 7:24 What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it?
21Àü 7:25 I directed my mind to know, to investigate, and to seek wisdom and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness.
21Àü 7:26 And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her.
21Àü 7:27 "Behold, I have discovered this," says the Preacher, "[adding] one thing to another to find an explanation,
21Àü 7:28 which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these.
21Àü 7:29 "Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices."
21Àü 8:1 Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam.
21Àü 8:2 I say, "Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God.
21Àü 8:3 "Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases."
21Àü 8:4 Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, "What are you doing?"
21Àü 8:5 He who keeps a [royal] command experiences no trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure.
21Àü 8:6 For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, when a man's trouble is heavy upon him.
21Àü 8:7 If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen?
21Àü 8:8 No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice it.
21Àü 8:9 All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over [another] man to his hurt.
21Àü 8:10 So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are [soon] forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is futility.
21Àü 8:11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil.
21Àü 8:12 Although a sinner does evil a hundred [times] and may lengthen his [ life,] still I know that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear Him openly.
21Àü 8:13 But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God.
21Àü 8:14 There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility.
21Àü 8:15 So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils [throughout] the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
21Àü 8:16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night),
21Àü 8:17 and I saw every work of God, [I concluded] that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the wise man should say, " I know, "he cannot discover.
21Àü 9:1 For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether [it will be] love or hatred; anything awaits him.
21Àü 9:2 It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean, and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear.
21Àü 9:3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil, and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they [go] to the dead.
21Àü 9:4 For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion.
21Àü 9:5 For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten.
21Àü 9:6 Indeed their love, their hate, and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun.
21Àü 9:7 Go [then,] eat your bread in happiness, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works.
21Àü 9:8 Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking on your head.
21Àü 9:9 Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life, and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.
21Àü 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, verily, do [it] with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going.
21Àü 9:11 I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise, nor wealth to the discerning, nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all.
21Àü 9:12 Moreover, man does not know his time£º like fish caught in a treacherous net, and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them.
21Àü 9:13 Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me.
21Àü 9:14 There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it, and constructed large siegeworks against it.
21Àü 9:15 But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
21Àü 9:16 So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded.
21Àü 9:17 The words of the wise heard in quietness are [better] than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
21Àü 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
21Àü 10:1 Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom [and] honor.
21Àü 10:2 A wise man's heart [directs him] toward the right, but the foolish man's heart [directs him] toward the left.
21Àü 10:3 Even when the fool walks along the road his sense is lacking, and he demonstrates to everyone [that] he is a fool.
21Àü 10:4 If the ruler's temper rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure allays great offenses.
21Àü 10:5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which goes forth from the ruler--
21Àü 10:6 folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places.
21Àü 10:7 I have seen slaves [riding] on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land.
21Àü 10:8 He who digs a pit may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall.
21Àü 10:9 He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them.
21Àü 10:10 If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen [its] edge, then he must exert more strength. Wisdom has the advantage of giving success.
21Àü 10:11 If the serpent bites before being charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.
21Àü 10:12 Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him;
21Àü 10:13 the beginning of his talking is folly, and the end of it is wicked madness.
21Àü 10:14 Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after him?
21Àü 10:15 The toil of a fool [so] wearies him that he does not [even] know how to go to a city.
21Àü 10:16 Woe to you, O land, whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning.
21Àü 10:17 Blessed are you, O land, whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time-- for strength, and not for drunkenness.
21Àü 10:18 Through indolence the rafters sag, and through slackness the house leaks.
21Àü 10:19 [Men] prepare a meal for enjoyment, and wine makes life merry, and money is the answer to everything.
21Àü 10:20 Furthermore, in your bedchamber do not curse a king, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man, for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound, and the winged creature will make the matter known.
21Àü 11:1 Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it after many days.
21Àü 11:2 Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth.
21Àü 11:3 If the clouds are full, they pour out rain upon the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, wherever the tree falls, there it lies.
21Àü 11:4 He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
21Àü 11:5 Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones [are formed] in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things.
21Àü 11:6 Sow your seed in the morning, and do not be idle in the evening, for you do not know whether morning or evening sowing will succeed, or whether both of them alike will be good.
21Àü 11:7 The light is pleasant, and [it is] good for the eyes to see the sun.
21Àü 11:8 Indeed, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. Everything that is to come [will be] futility.
21Àü 11:9 Rejoice, young man, during your childhood, and let your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that God will bring you to judgment for all these things.
21Àü 11:10 So, remove vexation from your heart and put away pain from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.
21Àü 12:1 Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, "I have no delight in them";
21Àü 12:2 before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened, and clouds return after the rain;
21Àü 12:3 in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble, and mighty men stoop, the grinding ones stand idle because they are few, and those who look through windows grow dim;
21Àü 12:4 and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird, and all the daughters of song will sing softly.
21Àü 12:5 Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags himself along, and the caperberry is ineffective. For man goes to his eternal home while mourners go about in the street.
21Àü 12:6 [Remember Him] before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed, the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed;
21Àü 12:7 then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.
21Àü 12:8 "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "all is vanity!"
21Àü 12:9 In addition to being a wise man, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge; and he pondered, searched out and arranged many proverbs.
21Àü 12:10 The Preacher sought to find delightful words and to write words of truth correctly.
21Àü 12:11 The words of wise men are like goads, and masters of [these] collections are like well-driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd.
21Àü 12:12 But beyond this, my son, be warned£º the writing of many books is endless, and excessive devotion [to books] is wearying to the body.
21Àü 12:13 The conclusion, when all has been heard, [is:] fear God and keep His commandments, because this [applies to] every person.
21Àü 12:14 For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.

22¾Æ 1:7 "Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture [your flock,] Where do you make [it] lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?"

22¾Æ 2:2 "Like a lily among the thorns, So is my darling among the maidens."
22¾Æ 2:3 "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
22¾Æ 2:4 "He has brought me to [his] banquet hall, And his banner over me is love.
22¾Æ 2:5 "Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, Because I am lovesick.
22¾Æ 2:6 "[Let] his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me."
22¾Æ 2:7 "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you will not arouse or awaken [my] love, Until she pleases."
22¾Æ 2:8 "Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills!
22¾Æ 2:9 "My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice.
22¾Æ 2:10 "My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along.
22¾Æ 2:11 'For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over [and] gone.
22¾Æ 2:12 'The flowers have [already] appeared in the land; The time has arrived for pruning [the vines,] And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.
22¾Æ 2:13 'The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along!' "
22¾Æ 2:14 "O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your form, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely."
22¾Æ 2:15 "Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom."
22¾Æ 2:16 "My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures [his flock] among the lilies.
22¾Æ 2:17 "Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether."
22¾Æ 3:1 "On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul loves; I sought him but did not find him.
22¾Æ 3:2 'I must arise now and go about the city; In the streets and in the squares I must seek him whom my soul loves.' I sought him but did not find him.
22¾Æ 3:3 "The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, [And I said,] ' Have you seen him whom my soul loves? '
22¾Æ 3:4 "Scarcely had I left them When I found him whom my soul loves; I held on to him and would not let him go, Until I had brought him to my mother's house, And into the room of her who conceived me."

22¾Æ 3:8 "All of them are wielders of the sword, Expert in war; Each man has his sword at his side, [Guarding] against the terrors of the night.
22¾Æ 3:9 "King Solomon has made for himself a sedan chair From the timber of Lebanon.
22¾Æ 3:10 "He made its posts of silver, Its back of gold [And] its seat of purple fabric, [With] its interior lovingly fitted out By the daughters of Jerusalem.
22¾Æ 3:11 "Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And gaze on King Solomon with the crown With which his mother has crowned him On the day of his wedding, And on the day of his gladness of heart."
22¾Æ 4:1 "How beautiful you are, my darling, How beautiful you are! Your eyes are [like] doves behind your veil; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Mount Gilead.

22¾Æ 4:7 "You are altogether beautiful, my darling, And there is no blemish in you.
22¾Æ 4:8 "[Come] with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, May you come with me from Lebanon. Journey down from the summit of Amana, From the summit of Senir and Hermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of leopards.

22¾Æ 4:10 "How beautiful is your love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is your love than wine, And the fragrance of your oils Than all [kinds] of spices!
22¾Æ 4:11 "Your lips, [my] bride, drip honey; Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22¾Æ 4:12 "A garden locked is my sister, [my] bride, A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up.
22¾Æ 4:13 "Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates With choice fruits, henna with nard plants,
22¾Æ 4:14 Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, With all the trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.
22¾Æ 4:15 "[You are] a garden spring, A well of fresh water, And streams [flowing] from Lebanon."
22¾Æ 4:16 "Awake, O north [wind,] And come, [wind of] the south; Make my garden breathe out [fragrance,] Let its spices be wafted abroad. May my beloved come into his garden And eat its choice fruits!"
22¾Æ 5:1 "I have come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers."
22¾Æ 5:2 "I was asleep, but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking£º 'Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.'
22¾Æ 5:3 "I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on [again?] I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them [again?]
22¾Æ 5:4 "My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were aroused for him.
22¾Æ 5:5 "I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.
22¾Æ 5:6 "I opened to my beloved, But my beloved had turned away [and] had gone! My heart went out [to him] as he spoke. I searched for him, but I did not find him; I called him, but he did not answer me.
22¾Æ 5:7 "The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, They struck me [and] wounded me; The guardsmen of the walls took away my shawl from me.
22¾Æ 5:8 "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you will tell him£º For I am lovesick."
22¾Æ 5:9 "What kind of beloved is your beloved, O most beautiful among women? What kind of beloved is your beloved, That thus you adjure us?"
22¾Æ 5:10 "My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, Outstanding among ten thousand.
22¾Æ 5:11 "His head is [like] gold, pure gold; His locks are [like] clusters of dates, [And] black as a raven.
22¾Æ 5:12 "His eyes are like doves, Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk, [ And] reposed in [their] setting.
22¾Æ 5:13 "His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Banks of sweet-scented herbs; His lips are lilies, Dripping with liquid myrrh.
22¾Æ 5:14 "His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl; His abdomen is carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires.
22¾Æ 5:15 "His legs are pillars of alabaster Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon, Choice as the cedars.
22¾Æ 5:16 "His mouth is [full of] sweetness. And he is wholly desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."
22¾Æ 6:1 "Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, That we may seek him with you?"
22¾Æ 6:2 "My beloved has gone down to his garden, To the beds of balsam, To pasture [his flock] in the gardens And gather lilies.
22¾Æ 6:3 "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine, He who pastures [his flock] among the lilies."
22¾Æ 6:4 "You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, As lovely as Jerusalem, As awesome as an army with banners.
22¾Æ 6:5 "Turn your eyes away from me, For they have confused me; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Gilead.
22¾Æ 6:6 "Your teeth are like a flock of ewes Which have come up from [their] washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young.
22¾Æ 6:7 "Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate Behind your veil.
22¾Æ 6:8 "There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, And maidens without number;
22¾Æ 6:9 [But] my dove, my perfect one, is unique£º She is her mother's only [ daughter;] She is the pure [child] of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed, The queens and the concubines [also,] and they praised her, [saying,]
22¾Æ 6:10 'Who is this that grows like the dawn, As beautiful as the full moon, As pure as the sun, As awesome as an army with banners?'
22¾Æ 6:11 "I went down to the orchard of nut trees To see the blossoms of the valley, To see whether the vine had budded [Or] the pomegranates had bloomed.
22¾Æ 6:12 "Before I was aware, my soul set me [Over] the chariots of my noble people."
22¾Æ 6:13 "Come back, come back, O Shulammite; Come back, come back, that we may gaze at you!" "Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, As at the dance of the two companies?

22¾Æ 7:2 "Your navel is [like] a round goblet Which never lacks mixed wine; Your belly is like a heap of wheat Fenced about with lilies.
22¾Æ 7:3 "Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle.
22¾Æ 7:4 "Your neck is like a tower of ivory, Your eyes [like] the pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, Which faces toward Damascus.
22¾Æ 7:5 "Your head crowns you like Carmel, And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads; [The] king is captivated by [your] tresses.
22¾Æ 7:6 "How beautiful and how delightful you are, [My] love, with [all] your charms!
22¾Æ 7:7 "Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are [like its] clusters.
22¾Æ 7:8 "I said, 'I will climb the palm tree, I will take hold of its fruit stalks.' Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples,
22¾Æ 7:9 And your mouth like the best wine! "" It goes [down] smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently [through] the lips of those who fall asleep.
22¾Æ 7:10 "I am my beloved's, And his desire is for me.
22¾Æ 7:11 "Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country, Let us spend the night in the villages.
22¾Æ 7:12 "Let us rise early [and go] to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded [And its] blossoms have opened, [And whether] the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love.
22¾Æ 7:13 "The mandrakes have given forth fragrance; And over our doors are all choice [fruits,] Both new and old, Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.
22¾Æ 8:1 "Oh that you were like a brother to me Who nursed at my mother's breasts. [If] I found you outdoors, I would kiss you; No one would despise me, either.
22¾Æ 8:2 "I would lead you [and] bring you Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates.
22¾Æ 8:3 "Let his left hand be under my head, And his right hand embrace me."
22¾Æ 8:4 "I want you to swear, O daughters of Jerusalem, Do not arouse or awaken [my] love, Until she pleases."
22¾Æ 8:5 "Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Leaning on her beloved?" "Beneath the apple tree I awakened you; There your mother was in labor with you, There she was in labor [and] gave you birth.
22¾Æ 8:6 "Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its flashes are flashes of fire, The [very] flame of the LORD.
22¾Æ 8:7 "Many waters cannot quench love, Nor will rivers overflow it; If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised."
22¾Æ 8:8 "We have a little sister, And she has no breasts; What shall we do for our sister On the day when she is spoken for?
22¾Æ 8:9 "If she is a wall, We shall build on her a battlement of silver; But if she is a door, We shall barricade her with planks of cedar."
22¾Æ 8:10 "I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace.
22¾Æ 8:11 "Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers; Each one was to bring a thousand [shekels] of silver for its fruit.

22¾Æ 8:13 "O you who sit in the gardens, [My] companions are listening for your voice-- Let me hear it!"

23»ç 1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem which he saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23»ç 1:2 Listen, O heavens, and hear, O earth; For the LORD speaks, "Sons I have reared and brought up, But they have revolted against Me.
23»ç 1:3 "An ox knows its owner, And a donkey its master's manger, [But] Israel does not know, My people do not understand."
23»ç 1:4 Alas, sinful nation, People weighed down with iniquity, Offspring of evildoers, Sons who act corruptly! They have abandoned the LORD, They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have turned away from Him.
23»ç 1:5 Where will you be stricken again, [As] you continue in [your] rebellion? The whole head is sick, And the whole heart is faint.
23»ç 1:6 From the sole of the foot even to the head There is nothing sound in it, [Only] bruises, welts, and raw wounds, Not pressed out or bandaged, Nor softened with oil.
23»ç 1:7 Your land is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire, Your fields-- strangers are devouring them in your presence; It is desolation, as overthrown by strangers.
23»ç 1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, Like a watchman's hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
23»ç 1:9 Unless the LORD of hosts Had left us a few survivors, We would be like Sodom, We would be like Gomorrah.
23»ç 1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the instruction of our God, You people of Gomorrah.
23»ç 1:11 "What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?" Says the LORD. "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams, And the fat of fed cattle. And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.
23»ç 1:12 "When you come to appear before Me, Who requires of you this trampling of My courts?
23»ç 1:13 "Bring your worthless offerings no longer, Incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly.
23»ç 1:14 "I hate your new moon [festivals] and your appointed feasts, They have become a burden to Me. I am weary of bearing [them.]
23»ç 1:15 "So when you spread out your hands [in prayer,] I will hide My eyes from you, Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
23»ç 1:16 "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Cease to do evil,
23»ç 1:17 Learn to do good; Seek justice, Reprove the ruthless; Defend the orphan, Plead for the widow.
23»ç 1:18 "Come now, and let us reason together," Says the LORD, "Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool.
23»ç 1:19 "If you consent and obey, You will eat the best of the land;
23»ç 1:20 "But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword." Truly, the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 1:21 How the faithful city has become a harlot, She [who] was full of justice! Righteousness once lodged in her, But now murderers.
23»ç 1:22 Your silver has become dross, Your drink diluted with water.
23»ç 1:23 Your rulers are rebels, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves a bribe, And chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan, Nor does the widow's plea come before them.
23»ç 1:24 Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel declares, "Ah, I will be relieved of My adversaries, And avenge Myself on My foes.
23»ç 1:25 "I will also turn My hand against you, And will smelt away your dross as with lye, And will remove all your alloy.
23»ç 1:26 "Then I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning; After that you will be called the city of righteousness, A faithful city."
23»ç 1:27 Zion will be redeemed with justice, And her repentant ones with righteousness.
23»ç 1:28 But transgressors and sinners will be crushed together, And those who forsake the LORD shall come to an end.
23»ç 1:29 Surely, you will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, And you will be embarrassed at the gardens which you have chosen.
23»ç 1:30 For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades away, Or as a garden that has no water.
23»ç 1:31 And the strong man will become tinder, His work also a spark. Thus they shall both burn together, And there will be none to quench [them].
23»ç 2:1 The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
23»ç 2:2 Now it will come about that In the last days, The mountain of the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains, And will be raised above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it.
23»ç 2:3 And many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To the house of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us concerning His ways, And that we may walk in His paths." For the law will go forth from Zion, And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23»ç 2:4 And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.
23»ç 2:5 Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
23»ç 2:6 For Thou hast abandoned Thy people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled [with influences] from the east, And [they are] soothsayers like the Philistines, And they strike [bargains] with the children of foreigners.
23»ç 2:7 Their land has also been filled with silver and gold, And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses, And there is no end to their chariots.
23»ç 2:8 Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.
23»ç 2:9 So the [common] man has been humbled, And the man [of importance] has been abased, But do not forgive them.
23»ç 2:10 Enter the rock and hide in the dust From the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty.
23»ç 2:11 The proud look of man will be abased, And the loftiness of man will be humbled, And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23»ç 2:12 For the LORD of hosts will have a day [of reckoning] Against everyone who is proud and lofty, And against everyone who is lifted up, That he may be abased.
23»ç 2:13 And [it will be] against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up, Against all the oaks of Bashan,
23»ç 2:14 Against all the lofty mountains, Against all the hills that are lifted up,
23»ç 2:15 Against every high tower, Against every fortified wall,
23»ç 2:16 Against all the ships of Tarshish, And against all the beautiful craft.
23»ç 2:17 And the pride of man will be humbled, And the loftiness of men will be abased, And the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23»ç 2:18 But the idols will completely vanish.
23»ç 2:19 And [men] will go into caves of the rocks, And into holes of the ground Before the terror of the LORD, And before the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble.
23»ç 2:20 In that day men will cast away to the moles and the bats Their idols of silver and their idols of gold, Which they made for themselves to worship,
23»ç 2:21 In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, Before the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty, When He arises to make the earth tremble.
23»ç 2:22 Stop regarding man, whose breath [of life] is in his nostrils; For why should he be esteemed?
23»ç 3:1 For behold, the Lord GOD of hosts is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread, And the whole supply of water;
23»ç 3:2 The mighty man and the warrior, The judge and the prophet, The diviner and the elder,
23»ç 3:3 The captain of fifty and the honorable man, The counselor and the expert artisan, And the skillful enchanter.
23»ç 3:4 And I will make mere lads their princes And capricious children will rule over them,
23»ç 3:5 And the people will be oppressed, Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor; The youth will storm against the elder, And the inferior against the honorable.
23»ç 3:6 When a man lays hold of his brother in his father's house, [saying,] " You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler, And these ruins will be under your charge, "
23»ç 3:7 On that day will he protest, saying, "I will not be [your] healer, For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; You should not appoint me ruler of the people."
23»ç 3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, Because their speech and their actions are against the LORD, To rebel against His glorious presence.
23»ç 3:9 The expression of their faces bears witness against them. And they display their sin like Sodom; They do not [even] conceal [it.] Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.
23»ç 3:10 Say to the righteous that [it will go] well [with them,] For they will eat the fruit of their actions.
23»ç 3:11 Woe to the wicked! [It will go] badly [with him,] For what he deserves will be done to him.
23»ç 3:12 O My people! Their oppressors are children, And women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead [you] astray, And confuse the direction of your paths.
23»ç 3:13 The LORD arises to contend, And stands to judge the people.
23»ç 3:14 The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of His people, "It is you who have devoured the vineyard; The plunder of the poor is in your houses.
23»ç 3:15 "What do you mean by crushing My people, And grinding the face of the poor?" Declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
23»ç 3:16 Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud, And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with mincing steps, And tinkle the bangles on their feet,
23»ç 3:17 Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, And the LORD will make their foreheads bare. "
23»ç 3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of [their] anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments,
23»ç 3:19 dangling earrings, bracelets, veils,
23»ç 3:20 headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets,
23»ç 3:21 finger rings, nose rings,
23»ç 3:22 festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses,
23»ç 3:23 hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans, and veils.
23»ç 3:24 Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth; And branding instead of beauty.
23»ç 3:25 Your men will fall by the sword, And your mighty ones in battle.
23»ç 3:26 And her gates will lament and mourn; And deserted she will sit on the ground.
23»ç 4:1 For seven women will take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach!"
23»ç 4:2 In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth [will] be the pride and the adornment of the survivors of Israel.
23»ç 4:3 And it will come about that he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy-- everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem.
23»ç 4:4 When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning,
23»ç 4:5 then the LORD will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy.
23»ç 4:6 And there will be a shelter to [give] shade from the heat by day, and refuge and protection from the storm and the rain.
23»ç 5:1 Let me sing now for my well-beloved A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill.
23»ç 5:2 And He dug it all around, removed its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. And He built a tower in the middle of it, And hewed out a wine vat in it; Then He expected [it] to produce [good] grapes, But it produced [only] worthless ones.
23»ç 5:3 "And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, Judge between Me and My vineyard.
23»ç 5:4 "What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected [it] to produce [good] grapes did it produce worthless ones?
23»ç 5:5 "So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard£º I will remove its hedge and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground.
23»ç 5:6 "And I will lay it waste; It will not be pruned or hoed, But briars and thorns will come up. I will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it."
23»ç 5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, And the men of Judah His delightful plant. Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress.
23»ç 5:8 Woe to those who add house to house [and] join field to field, Until there is no more room, So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land!
23»ç 5:9 In my ears the LORD of hosts [has sworn,] "Surely, many houses shall become desolate, [Even] great and fine ones, without occupants.
23»ç 5:10 "For ten acres of vineyard will yield [only] one bath [of wine,] And a homer of seed will yield [but] an ephah of grain."
23»ç 5:11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink; Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them!
23»ç 5:12 And their banquets are [accompanied] by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute, and by wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD, Nor do they consider the work of His hands.
23»ç 5:13 Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge; And their honorable men are famished, And their multitude is parched with thirst.
23»ç 5:14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without measure; And Jerusalem's splendor, her multitude, her din [of revelry,] and the jubilant within her, descend [into it.]
23»ç 5:15 So the [common] man will be humbled, and the man of [importance] abased, The eyes of the proud also will be abased.
23»ç 5:16 But the LORD of hosts will be exalted in judgment, And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
23»ç 5:17 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, And strangers will eat in the waste places of the wealthy.
23»ç 5:18 Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood, And sin as if with cart ropes;
23»ç 5:19 Who say, "Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see [it;] And let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near And come to pass, that we may know [it!]"
23»ç 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
23»ç 5:21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, And clever in their own sight!
23»ç 5:22 Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, And valiant men in mixing strong drink;
23»ç 5:23 Who justify the wicked for a bribe, And take away the rights of the ones who are in the right!
23»ç 5:24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble, And dry grass collapses into the flame, So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust; For they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 5:25 On this account the anger of the LORD has burned against His people, And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down, And the mountains quaked; and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets. For all this His anger is not spent, But His hand is still stretched out.
23»ç 5:26 He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation, And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth; And behold, it will come with speed swiftly.
23»ç 5:27 No one in it is weary or stumbles, None slumbers or sleeps; Nor is the belt at its waist undone, Nor its sandal strap broken.
23»ç 5:28 Its arrows are sharp, and all its bows are bent; The hoofs of its horses seem like flint, and its [chariot] wheels like a whirlwind.
23»ç 5:29 Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions; It growls as it seizes the prey, And carries [it] off with no one to deliver [it.]
23»ç 5:30 And it shall growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness [and] distress; Even the light is darkened by its clouds.
23»ç 6:1 In the year of King Uzziah's death, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple.
23»ç 6:2 Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
23»ç 6:3 And one called out to another and said, "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory."
23»ç 6:4 And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke.
23»ç 6:5 Then I said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts."
23»ç 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, with a burning coal in his hand which he had taken from the altar with tongs.
23»ç 6:7 And he touched my mouth [with it] and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is forgiven."
23»ç 6:8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
23»ç 6:9 And He said, "Go, and tell this people£º 'Keep on listening, but do not perceive; Keep on looking, but do not understand.'
23»ç 6:10 "Render the hearts of this people insensitive, Their ears dull, And their eyes dim, Lest they see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their hearts, And return and be healed."
23»ç 6:11 Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered, "Until cities are devastated [and] without inhabitant, Houses are without people, And the land is utterly desolate,
23»ç 6:12 "The LORD has removed men far away, And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
23»ç 6:13 "Yet there will be a tenth portion in it, And it will again be [subject] to burning, Like a terebinth or an oak Whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump."
23»ç 7:1 Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to [wage] war against it, but could not conquer it.
23»ç 7:2 When it was reported to the house of David, saying, "The Arameans have camped in Ephraim," his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind.
23»ç 7:3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway to the fuller's field,
23»ç 7:4 and say to him, 'Take care, and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.
23»ç 7:5 'Because Aram, [with] Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying,
23»ç 7:6 "Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,"
23»ç 7:7 thus says the Lord GOD, "It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass.
23»ç 7:8 "For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another 65 years Ephraim will be shattered, [so that it is] no longer a people),
23»ç 7:9 and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you surely shall not last. "'"
23»ç 7:10 Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
23»ç 7:11 "Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make [it] deep as Sheol or high as heaven."
23»ç 7:12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD!"
23»ç 7:13 Then he said, "Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well?
23»ç 7:14 "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign£º Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.
23»ç 7:15 "He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows [enough] to refuse evil and choose good.
23»ç 7:16 "For before the boy will know [enough] to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken.
23»ç 7:17 "The LORD will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house such days as have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah, the king of Assyria."
23»ç 7:18 And it will come about in that day, that the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
23»ç 7:19 And they will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and on all the watering places.
23»ç 7:20 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates ([that is,] with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard.
23»ç 7:21 Now it will come about in that day that a man may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep;
23»ç 7:22 and it will happen that because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone that is left within the land will eat curds and honey.
23»ç 7:23 And it will come about in that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, [valued] at a thousand [shekels] of silver, will become briars and thorns.
23»ç 7:24 [People] will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be briars and thorns.
23»ç 7:25 And as for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.
23»ç 8:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it in ordinary letters£º Swift is the booty, speedy is the prey.
23»ç 8:2 "And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
23»ç 8:3 So I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
23»ç 8:4 for before the boy knows how to cry out 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria. "
23»ç 8:5 And again the LORD spoke to me further, saying,
23»ç 8:6 "Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah, And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
23»ç 8:7 "Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates, Even the king of Assyria and all his glory; And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks.
23»ç 8:8 "Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through, It will reach even to the neck; And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.
23»ç 8:9 "Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered; And give ear, all remote places of the earth. Gird yourselves, yet be shattered; Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.
23»ç 8:10 "Devise a plan but it will be thwarted; State a proposal, but it will not stand, For God is with us."
23»ç 8:11 For thus the LORD spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
23»ç 8:12 "You are not to say, '[It is] a conspiracy!' In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy, And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of [it.]
23»ç 8:13 "It is the LORD of hosts whom you should regard as holy. And He shall be your fear, And He shall be your dread.
23»ç 8:14 "Then He shall become a sanctuary; But to both the houses of Israel, a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over, [And] a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
23»ç 8:15 "And many will stumble over them, Then they will fall and be broken; They will even be snared and caught."
23»ç 8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
23»ç 8:17 And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; I will even look eagerly for Him.
23»ç 8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23»ç 8:19 And when they say to you, "Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter," should not a people consult their God? [ Should they] [consult] the dead on behalf of the living?
23»ç 8:20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn.
23»ç 8:21 And they will pass through the land hard-pressed and famished, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will be enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward.
23»ç 8:22 Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and [they will be] driven away into darkness.
23»ç 9:1 But there will be no [more] gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make [it] glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
23»ç 9:2 The people who walk in darkness Will see a great light; Those who live in a dark land, The light will shine on them.
23»ç 9:3 Thou shalt multiply the nation, Thou shalt increase their gladness; They will be glad in Thy presence As with the gladness of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
23»ç 9:4 For Thou shalt break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders, The rod of their oppressor, as at the battle of Midian.
23»ç 9:5 For every boot of the booted warrior in the [battle] tumult, And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
23»ç 9:6 For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
23»ç 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of [His] government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.
23»ç 9:8 The Lord sends a message against Jacob, And it falls on Israel.
23»ç 9:9 And all the people know [it,] [That is,] Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, Asserting in pride and in arrogance of heart£º
23»ç 9:10 "The bricks have fallen down, But we will rebuild with smooth stones; The sycamores have been cut down, But we will replace [them] with cedars."
23»ç 9:11 Therefore the LORD raises against them adversaries from Rezin, And spurs their enemies on,
23»ç 9:12 The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west; And they devour Israel with gaping jaws. In [spite of] all this His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out.
23»ç 9:13 Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them, Nor do they seek the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 9:14 So the LORD cuts off head and tail from Israel, [Both] palm branch and bulrush in a single day.
23»ç 9:15 The head is the elder and honorable man, And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail.
23»ç 9:16 For those who guide this people are leading [them] astray; And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion.
23»ç 9:17 Therefore the Lord does not take pleasure in their young men, Nor does He have pity on their orphans or their widows; For every one of them is godless and an evildoer, And every mouth is speaking foolishness. In [spite of] all this His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out.
23»ç 9:18 For wickedness burns like a fire; It consumes briars and thorns; It even sets the thickets of the forest aflame, And they roll upward in a column of smoke.
23»ç 9:19 By the fury of the LORD of hosts the land is burned up, And the people are like fuel for the fire; No man spares his brother.
23»ç 9:20 And they slice off [what is] on the right hand but [still] are hungry, And they eat [what is] on the left hand but they are not satisfied; Each of them eats the flesh of his own arm.
23»ç 9:21 Manasseh [devours] Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, [And] together they are against Judah. In [spite of] all this His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out.
23»ç 10:1 Woe to those who enact evil statutes, And to those who constantly record unjust decisions,
23»ç 10:2 So as to deprive the needy of justice, And rob the poor of My people of [their] rights, In order that widows may be their spoil, And that they may plunder the orphans.
23»ç 10:3 Now what will you do in the day of punishment, And in the devastation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your wealth?
23»ç 10:4 Nothing [remains] but to crouch among the captives Or fall among the slain. In [spite of] all this His anger does not turn away, And His hand is still stretched out.
23»ç 10:5 Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger And the staff in whose hands is My indignation,
23»ç 10:6 I send it against a godless nation And commission it against the people of My fury To capture booty and to seize plunder, And to trample them down like mud in the streets.
23»ç 10:7 Yet it does not so intend Nor does it plan so in its heart, But rather it is its purpose to destroy, And to cut off many nations.
23»ç 10:8 For it says, "Are not my princes all kings?
23»ç 10:9 "Is not Calno like Carchemish, Or Hamath like Arpad, Or Samaria like Damascus?
23»ç 10:10 "As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols, Whose graven images [were] greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
23»ç 10:11 Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols? "
23»ç 10:12 So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, [He will say,] "I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his haughtiness."
23»ç 10:13 For he has said, "By the power of my hand and by my wisdom I did [ this,] For I have understanding; And I removed the boundaries of the peoples, And plundered their treasures, And like a mighty man I brought down [their] inhabitants,
23»ç 10:14 And my hand reached to the riches of the peoples like a nest, And as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth; And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened [its] beak or chirped. "
23»ç 10:15 Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it? Is the saw to exalt itself over the one who wields it? [That would be] like a club wielding those who lift it, [Or] like a rod lifting [him who] is not wood.
23»ç 10:16 Therefore the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will send a wasting disease among his stout warriors; And under his glory a fire will be kindled like a burning flame.
23»ç 10:17 And the light of Israel will become a fire and his Holy One a flame, And it will burn and devour his thorns and his briars in a single day.
23»ç 10:18 And He will destroy the glory of his forest and of his fruitful garden, both soul and body; And it will be as when a sick man wastes away.
23»ç 10:19 And the rest of the trees of his forest will be so small in number That a child could write them down.
23»ç 10:20 Now it will come about in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them, but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 10:21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
23»ç 10:22 For though your people, O Israel, may be like the sand of the sea, [ Only] a remnant within them will return; A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
23»ç 10:23 For a complete destruction, one that is decreed, the Lord GOD of hosts will execute in the midst of the whole land.
23»ç 10:24 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod and lifts up his staff against you, the way Egypt [did.]
23»ç 10:25 "For in a very little while My indignation [against you] will be spent, and My anger [will be directed] to their destruction."
23»ç 10:26 And the LORD of hosts will arouse a scourge against him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way [He did] in Egypt.
23»ç 10:27 So it will be in that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be broken because of fatness.
23»ç 10:28 He has come against Aiath, He has passed through Migron; At Michmash he deposited his baggage.
23»ç 10:29 They have gone through the pass, [saying,] "Geba will be our lodging place." Ramah is terrified, and Gibeah of Saul has fled away.
23»ç 10:30 Cry aloud with your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Pay attention, Laishah [and] wretched Anathoth!
23»ç 10:31 Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
23»ç 10:32 Yet today he will halt at Nob; He shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
23»ç 10:33 Behold, the Lord, the GOD of hosts, will lop off the boughs with a terrible crash; Those also who are tall in stature will be cut down, And those who are lofty will be abased.
23»ç 10:34 And He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron [axe,] And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
23»ç 11:1 Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.
23»ç 11:2 And the Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
23»ç 11:3 And He will delight in the fear of the LORD, And He will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear;
23»ç 11:4 But with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.
23»ç 11:5 Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt about His waist.
23»ç 11:6 And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the kid, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little boy will lead them.
23»ç 11:7 Also the cow and the bear will graze; Their young will lie down together; And the lion will eat straw like the ox.
23»ç 11:8 And the nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child will put his hand on the viper's den.
23»ç 11:9 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea.
23»ç 11:10 Then it will come about in that day That the nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious.
23»ç 11:11 Then it will happen on that day that the Lord Will again recover the second time with His hand The remnant of His people, who will remain, From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, And from the islands of the sea.
23»ç 11:12 And He will lift up a standard for the nations, And will assemble the banished ones of Israel, And will gather the dispersed of Judah From the four corners of the earth.
23»ç 11:13 Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, And those who harass Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, And Judah will not harass Ephraim.
23»ç 11:14 And they will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the west; Together they will plunder the sons of the east; They will possess Edom and Moab; And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.
23»ç 11:15 And the LORD will utterly destroy The tongue of the Sea of Egypt; And He will wave His hand over the River With His scorching wind; And He will strike it into seven streams, And make [men] walk over dry-shod.
23»ç 11:16 And there will be a highway from Assyria For the remnant of His people who will be left, Just as there was for Israel In the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt.
23»ç 12:1 Then you will say on that day, "I will give thanks to Thee, O LORD; For although Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, And Thou dost comfort me.
23»ç 12:2 "Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; For the LORD GOD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation."
23»ç 12:3 Therefore you will joyously draw water From the springs of salvation.
23»ç 12:4 And in that day you will say, "Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; Make [them] remember that His name is exalted."
23»ç 12:5 Praise the LORD in song, for He has done excellent things; Let this be known throughout the earth.
23»ç 12:6 Cry aloud and shout for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 13:1 The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
23»ç 13:2 Lift up a standard on the bare hill, Raise your voice to them, Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles.
23»ç 13:3 I have commanded My consecrated ones, I have even called My mighty warriors, My proudly exulting ones, To [execute] My anger.
23»ç 13:4 A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle.
23»ç 13:5 They are coming from a far country From the farthest horizons, The LORD and His instruments of indignation, To destroy the whole land.
23»ç 13:6 Wail, for the day of the LORD is near! It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
23»ç 13:7 Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every man's heart will melt.
23»ç 13:8 And they will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of [them]; They will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in astonishment, Their faces aflame.
23»ç 13:9 Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it.
23»ç 13:10 For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises, And the moon will not shed its light.
23»ç 13:11 Thus I will punish the world for its evil, And the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud, And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless.
23»ç 13:12 I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold, And mankind than the gold of Ophir.
23»ç 13:13 Therefore I shall make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken from its place At the fury of the LORD of hosts In the day of His burning anger.
23»ç 13:14 And it will be that like a hunted gazelle, Or like sheep with none to gather [them,] They will each turn to his own people, And each one flee to his own land.
23»ç 13:15 Anyone who is found will be thrust through, And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword.
23»ç 13:16 Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces Before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished.
23»ç 13:17 Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them, Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold,
23»ç 13:18 And [their] bows will mow down the young men, They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, [Nor] will their eye pity children.
23»ç 13:19 And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
23»ç 13:20 It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch [his] tent there, Nor will shepherds make [their flocks] lie down there.
23»ç 13:21 But desert creatures will lie down there, And their houses will be full of owls, Ostriches also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there.
23»ç 13:22 And hyenas will howl in their fortified towers And jackals in their luxurious palaces. Her [fateful] time also will soon come And her days will not be prolonged.
23»ç 14:1 When the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and again choose Israel, and settle them in their own land, then strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
23»ç 14:2 And the peoples will take them along and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the LORD as male servants and female servants; and they will take their captors captive, and will rule over their oppressors.
23»ç 14:3 And it will be in the day when the LORD gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and harsh service in which you have been enslaved,
23»ç 14:4 that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased, [And how] fury has ceased!
23»ç 14:5 "The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of rulers
23»ç 14:6 Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes, Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution.
23»ç 14:7 "The whole earth is at rest [and] is quiet; They break forth into shouts of joy.
23»ç 14:8 "Even the cypress trees rejoice over you, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying,] 'Since you were laid low, no [tree] cutter comes up against us.'
23»ç 14:9 "Sheol from beneath is excited over you to meet you when you come; It arouses for you the spirits of the dead, all the leaders of the earth; It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.
23»ç 14:10 "They will all respond and say to you, 'Even you have been made weak as we, You have become like us.
23»ç 14:11 'Your pomp [and] the music of your harps Have been brought down to Sheol; Maggots are spread out [as your bed] beneath you, And worms are your covering.'
23»ç 14:12 "How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the nations!
23»ç 14:13 "But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the recesses of the north.
23»ç 14:14 'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'
23»ç 14:15 "Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit.
23»ç 14:16 "Those who see you will gaze at you, They will ponder over you, [saying,] 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms,
23»ç 14:17 Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to [go] home? '
23»ç 14:18 "All the kings of the nations lie in glory, Each in his own tomb.
23»ç 14:19 "But you have been cast out of your tomb Like a rejected branch, Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit, Like a trampled corpse.
23»ç 14:20 "You will not be united with them in burial, Because you have ruined your country, You have slain your people. May the offspring of evildoers not be mentioned forever.
23»ç 14:21 "Prepare for his sons a place of slaughter Because of the iniquity of their fathers. They must not arise and take possession of the earth And fill the face of the world with cities."
23»ç 14:22 "And I will rise up against them," declares the LORD of hosts, " and will cut off from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and posterity, " declares the LORD.
23»ç 14:23 "I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog, and swamps of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," declares the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 14:24 The LORD of hosts has sworn saying, "Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand,
23»ç 14:25 to break Assyria in My land, and I will trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke will be removed from them, and his burden removed from their shoulder.
23»ç 14:26 "This is the plan devised against the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations.
23»ç 14:27 "For the LORD of hosts has planned, and who can frustrate [it]? And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?"
23»ç 14:28 In the year that King Ahaz died this oracle came£º
23»ç 14:29 "Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, Because the rod that struck you is broken; For from the serpent's root a viper will come out, And its fruit will be a flying serpent.
23»ç 14:30 "And those who are most helpless will eat, And the needy will lie down in security; I will destroy your root with famine, And it will kill off your survivors.
23»ç 14:31 "Wail, O gate; cry, O city; Melt away, O Philistia, all of you; For smoke comes from the north, And there is no straggler in his ranks.
23»ç 14:32 "How then will one answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD has founded Zion, And the afflicted of His people will seek refuge in it."
23»ç 15:1 The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated [and] ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated [and] ruined.
23»ç 15:2 They have gone up to the temple and [to] Dibon, [even] to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald [and] every beard is cut off.
23»ç 15:3 In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.
23»ç 15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him.
23»ç 15:5 My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar [and] Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over [their] ruin.
23»ç 15:6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing.
23»ç 15:7 Therefore the abundance [which] they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim.
23»ç 15:8 For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail [goes] as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim.
23»ç 15:9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added [woes] upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
23»ç 16:1 Send the [tribute] lamb to the ruler of the land, From Sela by way of the wilderness to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
23»ç 16:2 Then, like fleeing birds [or] scattered nestlings, The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon.
23»ç 16:3 "Give [us] advice, make a decision; Cast your shadow like night at high noon; Hide the outcasts, do not betray the fugitive.
23»ç 16:4 "Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you; Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer." For the extortioner has come to an end, destruction has ceased, Oppressors have completely [disappeared] from the land.
23»ç 16:5 A throne will even be established in lovingkindness, And a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David; Moreover, he will seek justice And be prompt in righteousness.
23»ç 16:6 We have heard of the pride of Moab, an excessive pride; [Even] of his arrogance, pride, and fury; His idle boasts are false.
23»ç 16:7 Therefore Moab shall wail; everyone of Moab shall wail. You shall moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth As those who are utterly stricken.
23»ç 16:8 For the fields of Heshbon have withered, the vines of Sibmah [as well]; The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters Which reached as far as Jazer [and] wandered to the deserts; Its tendrils spread themselves out [and] passed over the sea.
23»ç 16:9 Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away.
23»ç 16:10 And gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field; In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting, No treader treads out wine in the presses, [For] I have made the shouting to cease.
23»ç 16:11 Therefore my heart intones like a harp for Moab, And my inward feelings for Kir-hareseth.
23»ç 16:12 So it will come about when Moab presents himself, When he wearies himself upon [his] high place, And comes to his sanctuary to pray, That he will not prevail.
23»ç 16:13 This is the word which the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
23»ç 16:14 But now the LORD speaks, saying, "Within three years, as a hired man would count them, the glory of Moab will be degraded along with all [his] great population, and [his] remnant will be very small [and] impotent."
23»ç 17:1 The oracle concerning Damascus. "Behold, Damascus is about to be removed from being a city, And it will become a fallen ruin.
23»ç 17:2 "The cities of Aroer are forsaken; They will be for flocks to lie down in, And there will be no one to frighten [them.]
23»ç 17:3 "The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, And sovereignty from Damascus And the remnant of Aram; They will be like the glory of the sons of Israel," Declares the LORD of hosts.
23»ç 17:4 Now it will come about in that day that the glory of Jacob will fade, And the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
23»ç 17:5 It will be even like the reaper gathering the standing grain, As his arm harvests the ears, Or it will be like one gleaning ears of grain In the valley of Rephaim.
23»ç 17:6 Yet gleanings will be left in it like the shaking of an olive tree, Two [or] three olives on the topmost bough, Four [or] five on the branches of a fruitful tree, Declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
23»ç 17:7 In that day man will have regard for his Maker, And his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 17:8 And he will not have regard for the altars, the work of his hands, Nor will he look to that which his fingers have made, Even the Asherim and incense stands.
23»ç 17:9 In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken places in the forest, Or like branches which they abandoned before the sons of Israel; And the land will be a desolation.
23»ç 17:10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation And have not remembered the rock of your refuge. Therefore you plant delightful plants And set them with vine slips of a strange [god.]
23»ç 17:11 In the day that you plant [it] you carefully fence [it] in, And in the morning you bring your seed to blossom; [But] the harvest will be a heap In a day of sickliness and incurable pain.
23»ç 17:12 Alas, the uproar of many peoples Who roar like the roaring of the seas, And the rumbling of nations Who rush on like the rumbling of mighty waters!
23»ç 17:13 The nations rumble on like the rumbling of many waters, But He will rebuke them and they will flee far away, And be chased like chaff in the mountains before the wind, Or like whirling dust before a gale.
23»ç 17:14 At evening time, behold, [there is] terror! Before morning they are no more. Such [will be] the portion of those who plunder us, And the lot of those who pillage us.
23»ç 18:1 Alas, oh land of whirring wings Which lies beyond the rivers of Cush,
23»ç 18:2 Which sends envoys by the sea, Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, To a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation Whose land the rivers divide.
23»ç 18:3 All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, As soon as a standard is raised on the mountains, you will see [it,] And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear [it.]
23»ç 18:4 For thus the LORD has told me, "I will look from My dwelling place quietly Like dazzling heat in the sunshine, Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
23»ç 18:5 For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms And the flower becomes a ripening grape, Then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning knives And remove [and] cut away the spreading branches.
23»ç 18:6 They will be left together for mountain birds of prey, And for the beasts of the earth; And the birds of prey will spend the summer [feeding] on them, And all the beasts of the earth will spend harvest time on them.
23»ç 18:7 At that time a gift of homage will be brought to the LORD of hosts From a people tall and smooth, Even from a people feared far and wide, A powerful and oppressive nation, Whose land the rivers divide-- To the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, [even] Mount Zion.
23»ç 19:1 The oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud, and is about to come to Egypt; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.
23»ç 19:2 "So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians; And they will each fight against his brother, and each against his neighbor, City against city, [ and] kingdom against kingdom.
23»ç 19:3 "Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them; And I will confound their strategy, So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the dead, And to mediums and spiritists.
23»ç 19:4 "Moreover, I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel master, And a mighty king will rule over them," declares the Lord GOD of hosts.
23»ç 19:5 And the waters from the sea will dry up, And the river will be parched and dry.
23»ç 19:6 And the canals will emit a stench, The streams of Egypt will thin out and dry up; The reeds and rushes will rot away.
23»ç 19:7 The bulrushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile And all the sown fields by the Nile Will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
23»ç 19:8 And the fishermen will lament, And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn, And those who spread nets on the waters will pine away.
23»ç 19:9 Moreover, the manufacturers of linen made from combed flax And the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected.
23»ç 19:10 And the pillars [of Egypt] will be crushed; All the hired laborers will be grieved in soul.
23»ç 19:11 The princes of Zoan are mere fools; The advice of Pharaoh's wisest advisers has become stupid. How can you [men] say to Pharaoh, "I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings"?
23»ç 19:12 Well then, where are your wise men? Please let them tell you, And let them understand what the LORD of hosts Has purposed against Egypt.
23»ç 19:13 The princes of Zoan have acted foolishly, The princes of Memphis are deluded; [Those who are] the cornerstone of her tribes Have led Egypt astray.
23»ç 19:14 The LORD has mixed within her a spirit of distortion; They have led Egypt astray in all that it does, As a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
23»ç 19:15 And there will be no work for Egypt Which [its] head or tail, [its] palm branch or bulrush, may do.
23»ç 19:16 In that day the Egyptians will become like women, and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He is going to wave over them.
23»ç 19:17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts which He is purposing against them.
23»ç 19:18 In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing [allegiance] to the LORD of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction.
23»ç 19:19 In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD near its border.
23»ç 19:20 And it will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Champion, and He will deliver them.
23»ç 19:21 Thus the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. They will even worship with sacrifice and offering, and will make a vow to the LORD and perform it.
23»ç 19:22 And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking but healing; so they will return to the LORD, and He will respond to them and will heal them.
23»ç 19:23 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
23»ç 19:24 In that day Israel will be the third [party] with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth,
23»ç 19:25 whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance."
23»ç 20:1 In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,
23»ç 20:2 at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips, and take your shoes off your feet." And he did so, going naked and barefoot.
23»ç 20:3 And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against Egypt and Cush,
23»ç 20:4 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
23»ç 20:5 "Then they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast.
23»ç 20:6 "So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?'"
23»ç 21:1 The oracle concerning the wilderness of the sea. As windstorms in the Negev sweep on, It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land.
23»ç 21:2 A harsh vision has been shown to me; The treacherous one still deals treacherously, [and] the destroyer still destroys. Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media; I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused.
23»ç 21:3 For this reason my loins are full of anguish; Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor. I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see.
23»ç 21:4 My mind reels, horror overwhelms me; The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling.
23»ç 21:5 They set the table, they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink; "Rise up, captains, oil the shields,"
23»ç 21:6 For thus the Lord says to me, "Go, station the lookout, let him report what he sees.
23»ç 21:7 "When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, A train of donkeys, a train of camels, Let him pay close attention, very close attention."
23»ç 21:8 Then the lookout called, "O Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower, And I am stationed every night at my guard post.
23»ç 21:9 "Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs." And one answered and said, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground."
23»ç 21:10 O my threshed [people,] and my afflicted of the threshing floor! What I have heard from the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, I make known to you.
23»ç 21:11 The oracle concerning Edom. One keeps calling to me from Seir, " Watchman, how far gone is the night? Watchman, how far gone is the night? "
23»ç 21:12 The watchman says, "Morning comes but also night. If you would inquire, inquire; Come back again."
23»ç 21:13 The oracle about Arabia. In the thickets of Arabia you must spend the night, O caravans of Dedanites.
23»ç 21:14 Bring water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of the land of Tema, Meet the fugitive with bread.
23»ç 21:15 For they have fled from the swords, From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, And from the press of battle.
23»ç 21:16 For thus the Lord said to me, "In a year, as a hired man would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will terminate;
23»ç 21:17 and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD God of Israel has spoken. "
23»ç 22:1 The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?
23»ç 22:2 You who were full of noise, You boisterous town, you exultant city; Your slain were not slain with the sword, Nor did they die in battle.
23»ç 22:3 All your rulers have fled together, [And] have been captured without the bow; All of you who were found were taken captive together, Though they had fled far away.
23»ç 22:4 Therefore I say, "Turn your eyes away from me, Let me weep bitterly, Do not try to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people."
23»ç 22:5 For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day of panic, subjugation, and confusion In the valley of vision, A breaking down of walls And a crying to the mountain.
23»ç 22:6 And Elam took up the quiver With the chariots, infantry, [and] horsemen; And Kir uncovered the shield.
23»ç 22:7 Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots, And the horsemen took up fixed positions at the gate.
23»ç 22:8 And He removed the defense of Judah. In that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest,
23»ç 22:9 And you saw that the breaches In the [wall] of the city of David were many; And you collected the waters of the lower pool.
23»ç 22:10 Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem, And you tore down houses to fortify the wall.
23»ç 22:11 And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters of the old pool. But you did not depend on Him who made it, Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago.
23»ç 22:12 Therefore in that day the Lord GOD of hosts, called [you] to weeping, to wailing, To shaving the head, and to wearing sackcloth.
23»ç 22:13 Instead, there is gaiety and gladness, Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, Eating of meat and drinking of wine£º "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die."
23»ç 22:14 But the LORD of hosts revealed Himself to me, "Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you Until you die," says the Lord GOD of hosts.
23»ç 22:15 Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, To Shebna, who is in charge of the [royal] household,
23»ç 22:16 'What right do you have here, And whom do you have here, That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, You who hew a tomb on the height, You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock?
23»ç 22:17 'Behold, the LORD is about to hurl you headlong, O man. And He is about to grasp you firmly,
23»ç 22:18 [And] roll you tightly like a ball, [To be cast] into a vast country; There you will die, And there your splendid chariots will be, You shame of your master's house. '
23»ç 22:19 "And I will depose you from your office, And I will pull you down from your station.
23»ç 22:20 "Then it will come about in that day, That I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah
23»ç 22:21 And I will clothe him with your tunic, And tie your sash securely about him, I will entrust him with your authority, And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
23»ç 22:22 "Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder, When he opens no one will shut, When he shuts no one will open.
23»ç 22:23 "And I will drive him [like] a peg in a firm place, And he will become a throne of glory to his father's house.
23»ç 22:24 "So they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, offspring and issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars.
23»ç 22:25 "In that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "the peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."
23»ç 23:1 The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For [Tyre] is destroyed, without house [or] harbor; It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus.
23»ç 23:2 Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland, You merchants of Sidon; Your messengers crossed the sea
23»ç 23:3 And [were] on many waters. The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River was her revenue; And she was the market of nations.
23»ç 23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon; For the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying, "I have neither travailed nor given birth, I have neither brought up young men [nor] reared virgins."
23»ç 23:5 When the report [reaches] Egypt, They will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
23»ç 23:6 Pass over to Tarshish; Wail, O inhabitants of the coastland.
23»ç 23:7 Is this your jubilant [city,] Whose origin is from antiquity, Whose feet used to carry her to colonize distant places?
23»ç 23:8 Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, Whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?
23»ç 23:9 The LORD of hosts has planned it to defile the pride of all beauty, To despise all the honored of the earth.
23»ç 23:10 Overflow your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish, There is no more restraint.
23»ç 23:11 He has stretched His hand out over the sea, He has made the kingdoms tremble; The LORD has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strongholds.
23»ç 23:12 And He has said, "You shall exult no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest."
23»ç 23:13 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans-- this is the people [which] was not; Assyria appointed it for desert creatures-- they erected their siege towers, they stripped its palaces, they made it a ruin.
23»ç 23:14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For your stronghold is destroyed.
23»ç 23:15 Now it will come about in that day that Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as [in] the song of the harlot£º
23»ç 23:16 Take [your] harp, walk about the city, O forgotten harlot; Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs, That you may be remembered.
23»ç 23:17 And it will come about at the end of seventy years that the LORD will visit Tyre. Then she will go back to her harlot's wages, and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
23»ç 23:18 And her gain and her harlot's wages will be set apart to the LORD; it will not be stored up or hoarded, but her gain will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who dwell in the presence of the LORD.
23»ç 24:1 Behold, the LORD lays the earth waste, devastates it, distorts its surface, and scatters its inhabitants.
23»ç 24:2 And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the maid like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower, the creditor like the debtor.
23»ç 24:3 The earth will be completely laid waste and completely despoiled, for the LORD has spoken this word.
23»ç 24:4 The earth mourns [and] withers, the world fades [and] withers, the exalted of the people of the earth fade away.
23»ç 24:5 The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant.
23»ç 24:6 Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live in it are held guilty. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.
23»ç 24:7 The new wine mourns, The vine decays, All the merry-hearted sigh.
23»ç 24:8 The gaiety of tambourines ceases, The noise of revelers stops, The gaiety of the harp ceases.
23»ç 24:9 They do not drink wine with song; Strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
23»ç 24:10 The city of chaos is broken down; Every house is shut up so that none may enter.
23»ç 24:11 There is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine; All joy turns to gloom. The gaiety of the earth is banished.
23»ç 24:12 Desolation is left in the city, And the gate is battered to ruins.
23»ç 24:13 For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, As the shaking of an olive tree, As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over.
23»ç 24:14 They raise their voices, they shout for joy. They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the LORD.
23»ç 24:15 Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, The name of the LORD, the God of Israel In the coastlands of the sea.
23»ç 24:16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs, "Glory to the Righteous One," But I say, "Woe to me! Woe to me! Alas for me! The treacherous deal treacherously, And the treacherous deal very treacherously."
23»ç 24:17 Terror and pit and snare Confront you, O inhabitant of the earth.
23»ç 24:18 Then it will be that he who flees the report of disaster will fall into the pit, And he who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare; For the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake.
23»ç 24:19 The earth is broken asunder, The earth is split through, The earth is shaken violently.
23»ç 24:20 The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard, And it totters like a shack, For its transgression is heavy upon it, And it will fall, never to rise again.
23»ç 24:21 So it will happen in that day, That the LORD will punish the host of heaven, on high, And the kings of the earth, on earth.
23»ç 24:22 And they will be gathered together [Like] prisoners in the dungeon, And will be confined in prison; And after many days they will be punished.
23»ç 24:23 Then the moon will be abashed and the sun ashamed, For the LORD of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, And [His] glory will be before His elders.
23»ç 25:1 O LORD, Thou art my God; I will exalt Thee, I will give thanks to Thy name; For Thou hast worked wonders, Plans [formed] long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
23»ç 25:2 For Thou hast made a city into a heap, A fortified city into a ruin; A palace of strangers is a city no more, It will never be rebuilt.
23»ç 25:3 Therefore a strong people will glorify Thee; Cities of ruthless nations will revere Thee.
23»ç 25:4 For Thou hast been a defense for the helpless, A defense for the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; For the breath of the ruthless Is like a [rain] storm [against] a wall.
23»ç 25:5 Like heat in drought, Thou dost subdue the uproar of aliens; [Like] heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced.
23»ç 25:6 And the LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain; A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow, [ And] refined, aged wine.
23»ç 25:7 And on this mountain He will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, Even the veil which is stretched over all nations.
23»ç 25:8 He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord GOD will wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken.
23»ç 25:9 And it will be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation."
23»ç 25:10 For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, And Moab will be trodden down in his place As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile.
23»ç 25:11 And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it As a swimmer spreads out [his hands] to swim, But [the Lord] will lay low his pride together with the trickery of his hands.
23»ç 25:12 And the unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down, Lay low, [and] cast to the ground, even to the dust.
23»ç 26:1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah£º "We have a strong city; He sets up walls and ramparts for security.
23»ç 26:2 "Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that remains faithful.
23»ç 26:3 "The steadfast of mind Thou wilt keep in perfect peace, Because he trusts in Thee.
23»ç 26:4 "Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD, [we have] an everlasting Rock.
23»ç 26:5 "For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust.
23»ç 26:6 "The foot will trample it, The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the helpless."
23»ç 26:7 The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.
23»ç 26:8 Indeed, [while following] the way of Thy judgments, O LORD, We have waited for Thee eagerly; Thy name, even Thy memory, is the desire of [our] souls.
23»ç 26:9 At night my soul longs for Thee, Indeed, my spirit within me seeks Thee diligently; For when the earth experiences Thy judgments The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
23»ç 26:10 [Though] the wicked is shown favor, He does not learn righteousness; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness, And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD.
23»ç 26:11 O LORD, Thy hand is lifted up [yet] they do not see it. They see [Thy] zeal for the people and are put to shame; Indeed, fire will devour Thine enemies.
23»ç 26:12 LORD, Thou wilt establish peace for us, Since Thou hast also performed for us all our works.
23»ç 26:13 O LORD our God, other masters besides Thee have ruled us; [But] through Thee alone we confess Thy name.
23»ç 26:14 The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise; Therefore Thou hast punished and destroyed them, And Thou hast wiped out all remembrance of them.
23»ç 26:15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, Thou hast increased the nation, Thou art glorified; Thou hast extended all the borders of the land.
23»ç 26:16 O LORD, they sought Thee in distress; They could only whisper a prayer, Thy chastening was upon them.
23»ç 26:17 As the pregnant woman approaches [the time] to give birth, She writhes [and] cries out in her labor pains, Thus were we before Thee, O LORD.
23»ç 26:18 We were pregnant, we writhed [in labor], We gave birth, as it were, [only] to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth Nor were inhabitants of the world born.
23»ç 26:19 Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew is as the dew of the dawn, And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.
23»ç 26:20 Come, my people, enter into your rooms, And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little while, Until indignation runs [its] course.
23»ç 26:21 For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth will reveal her bloodshed, And will no longer cover her slain.
23»ç 27:1 In that day the LORD will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, With His fierce and great and mighty sword, Even Leviathan the twisted serpent; And He will kill the dragon who [lives] in the sea.
23»ç 27:2 In that day, "A vineyard of wine, sing of it!
23»ç 27:3 "I, the LORD, am its keeper; I water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I guard it night and day.
23»ç 27:4 "I have no wrath. Should someone give Me briars [and] thorns in battle, [Then] I would step on them, I would burn them completely.
23»ç 27:5 "Or let him rely on My protection, Let him make peace with Me, Let him make peace with Me."
23»ç 27:6 In the days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and sprout; And they will fill the whole world with fruit.
23»ç 27:7 Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them? Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain?
23»ç 27:8 Thou didst contend with them by banishing them, by driving them away. With His fierce wind He has expelled [them] on the day of the east wind.
23»ç 27:9 Therefore through this Jacob's iniquity will be forgiven; And this will be the full price of the pardoning of his sin£º When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones; [When] Asherim and incense altars will not stand.
23»ç 27:10 For the fortified city is isolated, A homestead forlorn and forsaken like the desert; There the calf will graze, And there it will lie down and feed on its branches.
23»ç 27:11 When its limbs are dry, they are broken off; Women come [and] make a fire with them. For they are not a people of discernment, Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them. And their Creator will not be gracious to them.
23»ç 27:12 And it will come about in that day, that the LORD will start [His] threshing from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel.
23»ç 27:13 It will come about also in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
23»ç 28:1 Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley Of those who are overcome with wine!
23»ç 28:2 Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty [agent;] As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, He has cast [it] down to the earth with [His] hand.
23»ç 28:3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot.
23»ç 28:4 And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, Which is at the head of the fertile valley, Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer; Which one sees, [And] as soon as it is in his hand, He swallows it.
23»ç 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people;
23»ç 28:6 A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment, A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
23»ç 28:7 And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink£º The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, They are confused by wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, They totter [ when rendering] judgment.
23»ç 28:8 For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a [single clean] place.
23»ç 28:9 "To whom would He teach knowledge? And to whom would He interpret the message? Those [just] weaned from milk? Those [just] taken from the breast?
23»ç 28:10 "For [He says,] 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'"
23»ç 28:11 Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue,
23»ç 28:12 He who said to them, "Here is rest, give rest to the weary," And, " Here is repose, "but they would not listen.
23»ç 28:13 So the word of the LORD to them will be, "Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there," That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared, and taken captive.
23»ç 28:14 Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers, Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem,
23»ç 28:15 Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death, And with Sheol we have made a pact. The overwhelming scourge will not reach us when it passes by, For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception."
23»ç 28:16 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone, A costly cornerstone [for] the foundation, firmly placed. He who believes [in it] will not be disturbed.
23»ç 28:17 "And I will make justice the measuring line, And righteousness the level; Then hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, And the waters shall overflow the secret place.
23»ç 28:18 "And your covenant with death shall be canceled, And your pact with Sheol shall not stand; When the overwhelming scourge passes through, Then you become its trampling [place.]
23»ç 28:19 "As often as it passes through, it will seize you. For morning after morning it will pass through, [anytime] during the day or night. And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means."
23»ç 28:20 The bed is too short on which to stretch out, And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in.
23»ç 28:21 For the LORD will rise up as [at] Mount Perazim, He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon; To do His task, His unusual task, And to work His work, His extraordinary work.
23»ç 28:22 And now do not carry on as scoffers, Lest your fetters be made stronger; For I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts, Of decisive destruction on all the earth.
23»ç 28:23 Give ear and hear my voice, Listen and hear my words.
23»ç 28:24 Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed? Does he [continually] turn and harrow the ground?
23»ç 28:25 Does he not level its surface, And sow dill and scatter cummin, And plant wheat in rows, Barley in its place, and rye within its area?
23»ç 28:26 For his God instructs and teaches him properly.
23»ç 28:27 For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is the cartwheel driven over cummin; But dill is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a club.
23»ç 28:28 [Grain for] bread is crushed, Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever. Because the wheel of [his] cart and his horses [eventually] damage [it,] He does not thresh it longer.
23»ç 28:29 This also comes from the LORD of hosts, [Who] has made [His] counsel wonderful and [His] wisdom great.
23»ç 29:1 Woe, O Ariel, Ariel the city [where] David [once] camped! Add year to year, observe [your] feasts on schedule.
23»ç 29:2 And I will bring distress to Ariel, And she shall be [a city of] lamenting and mourning; And she shall be like an Ariel to me.
23»ç 29:3 And I will camp against you encircling [you,] And I will set siegeworks against you, And I will raise up battle towers against you.
23»ç 29:4 Then you shall be brought low; From the earth you shall speak, And from the dust [where] you are prostrate, Your words [shall come.] Your voice shall also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech shall whisper from the dust.
23»ç 29:5 But the multitude of your enemies shall become like fine dust, And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away; And it shall happen instantly, suddenly.
23»ç 29:6 From the LORD of hosts you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, [With] whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire.
23»ç 29:7 And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel, Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, Shall be like a dream, a vision of the night.
23»ç 29:8 And it will be as when a hungry man dreams-- And behold, he is eating; But when he awakens, his hunger is not satisfied, Or as when a thirsty man dreams-- And behold, he is drinking, But when he awakens, behold, he is faint, And his thirst is not quenched. Thus the multitude of all the nations shall be, Who wage war against Mount Zion.
23»ç 29:9 Be delayed and wait. Blind yourselves and be blind. They become drunk, but not with wine; They stagger, but not with strong drink.
23»ç 29:10 For the LORD has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep, He has shut your eyes, the prophets; And He has covered your heads, the seers.
23»ç 29:11 And the entire vision shall be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, "Please read this," he will say, "I cannot, for it is sealed."
23»ç 29:12 Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, " Please read this. "And he will say," I cannot read. "
23»ç 29:13 Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned [by rote,]
23»ç 29:14 Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, And the discernment of their discerning men shall be concealed. "
23»ç 29:15 Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are [done] in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?"
23»ç 29:16 You turn [things] around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made should say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?
23»ç 29:17 Is it not yet just a little while Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field, And the fertile field will be considered as a forest?
23»ç 29:18 And on that day the deaf shall hear words of a book, And out of [their] gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.
23»ç 29:19 The afflicted also shall increase their gladness in the LORD, And the needy of mankind shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 29:20 For the ruthless will come to an end, and the scorner will be finished, Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be cut off;
23»ç 29:21 Who cause a person to be indicted by a word, And ensnare him who adjudicates at the gate, And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments.
23»ç 29:22 Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, "Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now turn pale;
23»ç 29:23 But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, They will sanctify My name; Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, And will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23»ç 29:24 "And those who err in mind will know the truth, And those who criticize will accept instruction.
23»ç 30:1 "Woe to the rebellious children," declares the LORD, "Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin;
23»ç 30:2 Who proceed down to Egypt, Without consulting Me, To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh, And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
23»ç 30:3 "Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame, And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.
23»ç 30:4 "For their princes are at Zoan, And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.
23»ç 30:5 "Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, [Who are] not for help or profit, but for shame and also for reproach."
23»ç 30:6 The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev. Through a land of distress and anguish, From where [come] lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys And their treasures on camels' humps, To a people who cannot profit [them;]
23»ç 30:7 Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty. Therefore, I have called her "Rahab who has been exterminated."
23»ç 30:8 Now go, write it on a tablet before them And inscribe it on a scroll, That it may serve in the time to come As a witness forever.
23»ç 30:9 For this is a rebellious people, false sons, Sons who refuse to listen To the instruction of the LORD;
23»ç 30:10 Who say to the seers, "You must not see [visions";] And to the prophets, "You must not prophesy to us what is right, Speak to us pleasant words, Prophesy illusions.
23»ç 30:11 "Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel."
23»ç 30:12 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Since you have rejected this word, And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them,
23»ç 30:13 Therefore this iniquity will be to you Like a breach about to fall, A bulge in a high wall, Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant.
23»ç 30:14 "And whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter's jar; So ruthlessly shattered That a sherd will not be found among its pieces To take fire from a hearth, Or to scoop water from a cistern."
23»ç 30:15 For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, "In repentance and rest you shall be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength." But you were not willing,
23»ç 30:16 And you said, "No, for we will flee on horses," Therefore you shall flee! "And we will ride on swift [horses,]" Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
23»ç 30:17 One thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one [man,] You shall flee at the threat of five; Until you are left as a flag on a mountain top, And as a signal on a hill.
23»ç 30:18 Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; How blessed are all those who long for Him.
23»ç 30:19 O people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.
23»ç 30:20 Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, [He,] your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will behold your Teacher.
23»ç 30:21 And your ears will hear a word behind you, "This is the way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right or to the left.
23»ç 30:22 And you will defile your graven images, overlaid with silver, and your molten images plated with gold. You will scatter them as an impure thing; [and] say to them, "Be gone!"
23»ç 30:23 Then He will give [you] rain for the seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread [from] the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plenteous; on that day your livestock will graze in a roomy pasture.
23»ç 30:24 Also the oxen and the donkeys which work the ground will eat salted fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
23»ç 30:25 And on every lofty mountain and on every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
23»ç 30:26 And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times [brighter,] like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted.
23»ç 30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD comes from a remote place; Burning is His anger, and dense is [His] smoke; His lips are filled with indignation, And His tongue is like a consuming fire;
23»ç 30:28 And His breath is like an overflowing torrent, Which reaches to the neck, To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve, And to [put] in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads to ruin.
23»ç 30:29 You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival; And gladness of heart as when one marches to [the sound of] the flute, To go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23»ç 30:30 And the LORD will cause His voice of authority to be heard. And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger, And [in] the flame of a consuming fire, In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.
23»ç 30:31 For at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be terrified, [When] He strikes with the rod.
23»ç 30:32 And every blow of the rod of punishment, Which the LORD will lay on him, Will be with [the music of] tambourines and lyres; And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them.
23»ç 30:33 For Topheth has long been ready, Indeed, it has been prepared for the king. He has made it deep and large, A pyre of fire with plenty of wood; The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire.
23»ç 31:1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, [And] rely on horses, And trust in chariots because they are many, And in horsemen because they are very strong, But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD!
23»ç 31:2 Yet He also is wise and will bring disaster, And does not retract His words, But will arise against the house of evildoers, And against the help of the workers of iniquity.
23»ç 31:3 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, And their horses are flesh and not spirit; So the LORD will stretch out His hand, And he who helps will stumble And he who is helped will fall, And all of them will come to an end together.
23»ç 31:4 For thus says the LORD to me, "As the lion or the young lion growls over his prey, Against which a band of shepherds is called out, Will not be terrified at their voice, nor disturbed at their noise, So will the LORD of hosts come down to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill."
23»ç 31:5 Like flying birds so the LORD of hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver [it;] He will pass over and rescue [it.]
23»ç 31:6 Return to Him from whom you have deeply defected, O sons of Israel.
23»ç 31:7 For in that day every man will cast away his silver idols and his gold idols, which your hands have made as a sin.
23»ç 31:8 And the Assyrian will fall by a sword not of man, And a sword not of man will devour him. So he will not escape the sword, And his young men will become forced laborers.
23»ç 31:9 "And his rock will pass away because of panic, And his princes will be terrified at the standard," Declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23»ç 32:1 Behold, a king will reign righteously, And princes will rule justly.
23»ç 32:2 And each will be like a refuge from the wind, And a shelter from the storm, Like streams of water in a dry country, Like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.
23»ç 32:3 Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the ears of those who hear will listen.
23»ç 32:4 And the mind of the hasty will discern the truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.
23»ç 32:5 No longer will the fool be called noble, Or the rogue be spoken of [ as] generous.
23»ç 32:6 For a fool speaks nonsense, And his heart inclines toward wickedness, To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the LORD, To keep the hungry person unsatisfied And to withhold drink from the thirsty.
23»ç 32:7 As for a rogue, his weapons are evil; He devises wicked schemes To destroy [the] afflicted with slander, Even though [the] needy one speaks what is right.
23»ç 32:8 But the noble man devises noble plans; And by noble plans he stands.
23»ç 32:9 Rise up you women who are at ease, And hear my voice; Give ear to my word, You complacent daughters.
23»ç 32:10 Within a year and [a few] days, You will be troubled, O complacent [daughters;] For the vintage is ended, And the [fruit] gathering will not come.
23»ç 32:11 Tremble, you [women] who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent [ daughters;] Strip, undress, and put [sackcloth] on [your] waist,
23»ç 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,
23»ç 32:13 For the land of my people [in which] thorns [and] briars shall come up; Yea, for all the joyful houses, [and for] the jubilant city.
23»ç 32:14 Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken. Hill and watch-tower have become caves forever, A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks;
23»ç 32:15 Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fertile field And the fertile field is considered as a forest.
23»ç 32:16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness will abide in the fertile field.
23»ç 32:17 And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
23»ç 32:18 Then my people will live in a peaceful habitation, And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places;
23»ç 32:19 And it will hail when the forest comes down, And the city will be utterly laid low.
23»ç 32:20 How blessed will you be, you who sow beside all waters, Who let out freely the ox and the donkey.
23»ç 33:1 Woe to you, O destroyer, While you were not destroyed; And he who is treacherous, while [others] did not deal treacherously with him. As soon as you shall finish destroying, you shall be destroyed; As soon as you shall cease to deal treacherously, [others] shall deal treacherously with you.
23»ç 33:2 O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for Thee. Be Thou their strength every morning, Our salvation also in the time of distress.
23»ç 33:3 At the sound of the tumult peoples flee; At the lifting up of Thyself nations disperse.
23»ç 33:4 And your spoil is gathered [as] the caterpillar gathers; As locusts rushing about, men rush about on it.
23»ç 33:5 The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
23»ç 33:6 And He shall be the stability of your times, A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.
23»ç 33:7 Behold, their brave men cry in the streets, The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
23»ç 33:8 The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased, He has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, He has no regard for man.
23»ç 33:9 The land mourns and pines away, Lebanon is shamed and withers; Sharon is like a desert plain, And Bashan and Carmel lose [their foliage.]
23»ç 33:10 "Now I will arise," says the LORD, "Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up.
23»ç 33:11 "You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire.
23»ç 33:12 "And the peoples will be burned to lime, Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire.
23»ç 33:13 "You who are far away, hear what I have done; And you who are near, acknowledge My might."
23»ç 33:14 Sinners in Zion are terrified; Trembling has seized the godless. " Who among us can live with the consuming fire? Who among us can live with continual burning? "
23»ç 33:15 He who walks righteously, and speaks with sincerity, He who rejects unjust gain, And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed, And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil;
23»ç 33:16 He will dwell on the heights; His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given [him;] His water will be sure.
23»ç 33:17 Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; They will behold a far-distant land.
23»ç 33:18 Your heart will meditate on terror£º "Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?"
23»ç 33:19 You will no longer see a fierce people, A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends, Of a stammering tongue which no one understands.
23»ç 33:20 Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; Your eyes shall see Jerusalem an undisturbed habitation, A tent which shall not be folded, Its stakes shall never be pulled up Nor any of its cords be torn apart.
23»ç 33:21 But there the majestic [One,] the LORD, shall be for us A place of rivers [and] wide canals, On which no boat with oars shall go, And on which no mighty ship shall pass--
23»ç 33:22 For the LORD is our judge, The LORD is our lawgiver, The LORD is our king; He will save us--
23»ç 33:23 Your tackle hangs slack; It cannot hold the base of its mast firmly, Nor spread out the sail. Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided; The lame will take the plunder.
23»ç 33:24 And no resident will say, "I am sick"; The people who dwell there will be forgiven [their] iniquity.
23»ç 34:1 Draw near, O nations, to hear; and listen, O peoples! Let the earth and all it contains hear, and the world and all that springs from it.
23»ç 34:2 For the Lord's indignation is against all the nations, And [His] wrath against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to slaughter.
23»ç 34:3 So their slain will be thrown out, And their corpses will give off their stench, And the mountains will be drenched with their blood.
23»ç 34:4 And all the host of heaven will wear away, And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll; All their hosts will also wither away As a leaf withers from the vine, Or as [one] withers from the fig tree.
23»ç 34:5 For My sword is satiated in heaven, Behold it shall descend for judgment upon Edom, And upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction.
23»ç 34:6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
23»ç 34:7 Wild oxen shall also fall with them, And young bulls with strong ones; Thus their land shall be soaked with blood, And their dust become greasy with fat.
23»ç 34:8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
23»ç 34:9 And its streams shall be turned into pitch, And its loose earth into brimstone, And its land shall become burning pitch.
23»ç 34:10 It shall not be quenched night or day; Its smoke shall go up forever; From generation to generation it shall be desolate; None shall pass through it forever and ever.
23»ç 34:11 But pelican and hedgehog shall possess it, And owl and raven shall dwell in it; And He shall stretch over it the line of desolation And the plumb line of emptiness.
23»ç 34:12 Its nobles-- there is no one there [Whom] they may proclaim king-- And all its princes shall be nothing.
23»ç 34:13 And thorns shall come up in its fortified towers, Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; It shall also be a haunt of jackals [And] an abode of ostriches.
23»ç 34:14 And the desert creatures shall meet with the wolves, The hairy goat also shall cry to its kind; Yes, the night monster shall settle there And shall find herself a resting place.
23»ç 34:15 The tree snake shall make its nest and lay [eggs] there, And it will hatch and gather [them] under its protection. Yes, the hawks shall be gathered there, Every one with its kind.
23»ç 34:16 Seek from the book of the LORD, and read£º Not one of these will be missing; None will lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, And His Spirit has gathered them.
23»ç 34:17 And He has cast the lot for them, And His hand has divided it to them by line. They shall possess it forever; From generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
23»ç 35:1 The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus
23»ç 35:2 It will blossom profusely And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God.
23»ç 35:3 Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble.
23»ç 35:4 Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come [with] vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you."
23»ç 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
23»ç 35:6 Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the dumb will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah.
23»ç 35:7 And the scorched land will become a pool, And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass [becomes] reeds and rushes.
23»ç 35:8 And a highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it [will] be for him who walks [that] way, And fools will not wander [on it].
23»ç 35:9 No lion will be there, Nor will any vicious beast go up on it; These will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk [there],
23»ç 35:10 And the ransomed of the LORD will return, And come with joyful shouting to Zion, With everlasting joy upon their heads. They will find gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23»ç 36:1 Now it came about in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
23»ç 36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller's field.
23»ç 36:3 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.
23»ç 36:4 Then Rabshakeh said to them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria," What is this confidence that you have?
23»ç 36:5 "I say, 'Your counsel and strength for the war are only empty words.' Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?
23»ç 36:6 "Behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, [even] on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
23»ç 36:7 "But if you say to me, 'We trust in the LORD our God,' is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship before this altar'?
23»ç 36:8 "Now therefore, come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
23»ç 36:9 "How then can you repulse one official of the least of my master's servants, and rely on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
23»ç 36:10 "And have I now come up without the Lord's approval against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'" '"
23»ç 36:11 Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand [it]; and do not speak with us in Judean, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
23»ç 36:12 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, [and] not to the men who sit on the wall, [ doomed] to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"
23»ç 36:13 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, and said, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
23»ç 36:14 "Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you;
23»ç 36:15 nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
23»ç 36:16 'Do not listen to Hezekiah,' for thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,
23»ç 36:17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23»ç 36:18 '[Beware] lest Hezekiah misleads you, saying, "The LORD will deliver us." Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
23»ç 36:19 'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
23»ç 36:20 'Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?' "
23»ç 36:21 But they were silent and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, "Do not answer him."
23»ç 36:22 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
23»ç 37:1 And when King Hezekiah heard [it], he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth and entered the house of the LORD.
23»ç 37:2 Then he sent Eliakim who was over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
23»ç 37:3 And they said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth, and there is no strength to deliver.
23»ç 37:4 'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.' "
23»ç 37:5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
23»ç 37:6 And Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your master, 'Thus says the LORD," Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
23»ç 37:7 "Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land." '"
23»ç 37:8 Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.
23»ç 37:9 When he heard [them] say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, "He has come out to fight against you," and when he heard [it] he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
23»ç 37:10 "Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying," Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. "
23»ç 37:11 'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be spared?
23»ç 37:12 'Did the gods of those nations which my fathers have destroyed deliver them, [even] Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who [were] in Telassar?
23»ç 37:13 'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, [and of] Hena and Ivvah?' "
23»ç 37:14 Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
23»ç 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD saying,
23»ç 37:16 "O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, who art enthroned [above] the cherubim, Thou art the God, Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made heaven and earth.
23»ç 37:17 "Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent [them] to reproach the living God.
23»ç 37:18 "Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the countries and their lands,
23»ç 37:19 and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
23»ç 37:20 "And now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou alone, LORD, art God."
23»ç 37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent [word] to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23»ç 37:22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him£º "She has despised you and mocked you, The virgin daughter of Zion; She has shaken [her] head behind you, The daughter of Jerusalem!
23»ç 37:23 "Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised [your] voice, And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23»ç 37:24 "Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, 'With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars [and] its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest.
23»ç 37:25 'I dug [wells] and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.'
23»ç 37:26 "Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
23»ç 37:27 "Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were [as] the vegetation of the field and [as] the green herb, [As] grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up.
23»ç 37:28 "But I know your sitting down, And your going out and your coming in, And your raging against Me.
23»ç 37:29 "Because of your raging against Me, And because your arrogance has come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose, And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back by the way which you came.
23»ç 37:30 "Then this shall be the sign for you£º you shall eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
23»ç 37:31 "And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
23»ç 37:32 "For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this." '
23»ç 37:33 "Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, ' He shall not come to this city, or shoot an arrow there; neither shall he come before it with a shield, nor throw up a mound against it.
23»ç 37:34 'By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city,' declares the LORD.
23»ç 37:35 'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.' "
23»ç 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went out, and struck 1850000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.
23»ç 37:37 So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed and returned [home], and lived at Nineveh.
23»ç 37:38 And it came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons killed him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place.
23»ç 38:1 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.'"
23»ç 38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD,
23»ç 38:3 and said, "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in Thy sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23»ç 38:4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
23»ç 38:5 "Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David," I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
23»ç 38:6 "And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city." '
23»ç 38:7 "And this shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He has spoken£º
23»ç 38:8 "Behold, I will cause the shadow on the stairway, which has gone down with the sun on the stairway of Ahaz, to go back ten steps." So the sun's [shadow] went back ten steps on the stairway on which it had gone down.
23»ç 38:9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after his illness and recovery£º
23»ç 38:10 I said, "In the middle of my life I am to enter the gates of Sheol; I am to be deprived of the rest of my years."
23»ç 38:11 I said, "I shall not see the LORD, The LORD in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
23»ç 38:12 "Like a shepherd's tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me; As a weaver I rolled up my life. He cuts me off from the loom; From day until night Thou dost make an end of me.
23»ç 38:13 "I composed [my soul] until morning. Like a lion-- so He breaks all my bones, From day until night Thou dost make an end of me.
23»ç 38:14 "Like a swallow, [like] a crane, so I twitter; I moan like a dove; My eyes look wistfully to the heights; O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security.
23»ç 38:15 "What shall I say? For He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it; I shall wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
23»ç 38:16 "O Lord, by [these] things [men] live; And in all these is the life of my spirit; O restore me to health, and let me live!
23»ç 38:17 "Lo, for [my own] welfare I had great bitterness; It is Thou who hast kept my soul from the pit of nothingness, For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.
23»ç 38:18 "For Sheol cannot thank Thee, Death cannot praise Thee; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Thy faithfulness.
23»ç 38:19 "It is the living who give thanks to Thee, as I do today; A father tells his sons about Thy faithfulness.
23»ç 38:20 "The LORD will surely save me; So we will play my songs on stringed instruments All [the] days of our life at the house of the LORD."
23»ç 38:21 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and apply it to the boil, that he may recover."
23»ç 38:22 Then Hezekiah had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"
23»ç 39:1 At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
23»ç 39:2 And Hezekiah was pleased, and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and his whole armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
23»ç 39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."
23»ç 39:4 And he said, "What have they seen in your house?" So Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them."
23»ç 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts,
23»ç 39:6 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,' says the LORD.
23»ç 39:7 'And [some] of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall beget, shall be taken away; and they shall become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.' "
23»ç 39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the LORD which you have spoken is good." For he thought, "For there will be peace and truth in my days."
23»ç 40:1 "Comfort, O comfort My people," says your God.
23»ç 40:2 "Speak kindly to Jerusalem; And call out to her, that her warfare has ended, That her iniquity has been removed, That she has received of the Lord's hand Double for all her sins."
23»ç 40:3 A voice is calling, "Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.
23»ç 40:4 "Let every valley be lifted up, And every mountain and hill be made low; And let the rough ground become a plain, And the rugged terrain a broad valley;
23»ç 40:5 Then the glory of the LORD will be revealed, And all flesh will see [it] together; For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. "
23»ç 40:6 A voice says, "Call out." Then he answered, "What shall I call out?" All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.
23»ç 40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades, When the breath of the LORD blows upon it; Surely the people are grass.
23»ç 40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever.
23»ç 40:9 Get yourself up on a high mountain, O Zion, bearer of good news, Lift up your voice mightily, O Jerusalem, bearer of good news; Lift [it] up, do not fear. Say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
23»ç 40:10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with might, With His arm ruling for Him. Behold, His reward is with Him, And His recompense before Him.
23»ç 40:11 Like a shepherd He will tend His flock, In His arm He will gather the lambs, And carry [them] in His bosom; He will gently lead the nursing [ewes.]
23»ç 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, And marked off the heavens by the span, And calculated the dust of the earth by the measure, And weighed the mountains in a balance, And the hills in a pair of scales?
23»ç 40:13 Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or as His counselor has informed Him?
23»ç 40:14 With whom did He consult and [who] gave Him understanding? And [who] taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him knowledge, And informed Him of the way of understanding?
23»ç 40:15 Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.
23»ç 40:16 Even Lebanon is not enough to burn, Nor its beasts enough for a burnt offering.
23»ç 40:17 All the nations are as nothing before Him, They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.
23»ç 40:18 To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare with Him?
23»ç 40:19 [As for] the idol, a craftsman casts it, A goldsmith plates it with gold, And a silversmith [fashions] chains of silver.
23»ç 40:20 He who is too impoverished for [such] an offering Selects a tree that does not rot; He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman To prepare an idol that will not totter.
23»ç 40:21 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
23»ç 40:22 It is He who sits above the vault of the earth, And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
23»ç 40:23 He [it is] who reduces rulers to nothing, Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
23»ç 40:24 Scarcely have they been planted, Scarcely have they been sown, Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth, But He merely blows on them, and they wither, And the storm carries them away like stubble.
23»ç 40:25 "To whom then will you liken Me That I should be [his] equal?" says the Holy One.
23»ç 40:26 Lift up your eyes on high And see who has created these [stars,] The One who leads forth their host by number, He calls them all by name; Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of [His] power Not one [of them] is missing.
23»ç 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God"?
23»ç 40:28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is inscrutable.
23»ç 40:29 He gives strength to the weary, And to [him who] lacks might He increases power.
23»ç 40:30 Though youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous young men stumble badly,
23»ç 40:31 Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They will mount up [with] wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary.
23»ç 41:1 "Coastlands, listen to Me in silence, And let the peoples gain new strength; Let them come forward, then let them speak; Let us come together for judgment.
23»ç 41:2 "Who has aroused one from the east Whom He calls in righteousness to His feet? He delivers up nations before him, And subdues kings. He makes them like dust with his sword, As the wind-driven chaff with his bow.
23»ç 41:3 "He pursues them, passing on in safety, By a way he had not been traversing with his feet.
23»ç 41:4 "Who has performed and accomplished [it,] Calling forth the generations from the beginning? 'I, the LORD, am the first, and with the last. I am He.'"
23»ç 41:5 The coastlands have seen and are afraid; The ends of the earth tremble; They have drawn near and have come.
23»ç 41:6 Each one helps his neighbor, And says to his brother, "Be strong!"
23»ç 41:7 So the craftsman encourages the smelter, [And] he who smooths [metal] with the hammer [encourages] him who beats the anvil, Saying of the soldering, "It is good"; And he fastens it with nails, [That] it should not totter.
23»ç 41:8 "But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, Descendant of Abraham My friend,
23»ç 41:9 You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest parts, And said to you, 'You are My servant, I have chosen you and not rejected you.
23»ç 41:10 'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'
23»ç 41:11 "Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored; Those who contend with you will be as nothing, and will perish.
23»ç 41:12 "You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them, Those who war with you will be as nothing, and non-existent.
23»ç 41:13 "For I am the LORD your God, who upholds your right hand, Who says to you, 'Do not fear, I will help you.'
23»ç 41:14 "Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel; I will help you," declares the LORD," and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 41:15 "Behold, I have made you a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges; You will thresh the mountains, and pulverize [them,] And will make the hills like chaff.
23»ç 41:16 "You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, And the storm will scatter them; But you will rejoice in the LORD, You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 41:17 "The afflicted and needy are seeking water, but there is none, And their tongue is parched with thirst; I, the LORD, will answer them Myself, [As] the God of Israel I will not forsake them.
23»ç 41:18 "I will open rivers on the bare heights, And springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, And the dry land fountains of water.
23»ç 41:19 "I will put the cedar in the wilderness, The acacia, and the myrtle, and the olive tree; I will place the juniper in the desert, Together with the box tree and the cypress,
23»ç 41:20 That they may see and recognize, And consider and gain insight as well, That the hand of the LORD has done this, And the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23»ç 41:21 "Present your case," the LORD says. "Bring forward your strong [arguments,]" The King of Jacob says.
23»ç 41:22 Let them bring forth and declare to us what is going to take place; As for the former [events,] declare what they [were,] That we may consider them, and know their outcome; Or announce to us what is coming.
23»ç 41:23 Declare the things that are going to come afterward, That we may know that you are gods; Indeed, do good or evil, that we may anxiously look about us and fear together.
23»ç 41:24 Behold, you are of no account, And your work amounts to nothing; He who chooses you is an abomination.
23»ç 41:25 "I have aroused one from the north, and he has come; From the rising of the sun he will call on My name; And he will come upon rulers as [ upon] mortar, Even as the potter treads clay."
23»ç 41:26 Who has declared [this] from the beginning, that we might know? Or from former times, that we may say, "[He is] right!"? Surely there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely there was no one who heard your words.
23»ç 41:27 "Formerly [I said] to Zion, 'Behold, here they are.' And to Jerusalem, 'I will give a messenger of good news.'
23»ç 41:28 "But when I look, there is no one, And there is no counselor among them Who, if I ask, can give an answer.
23»ç 41:29 "Behold, all of them are false; Their works are worthless, Their molten images are wind and emptiness.
23»ç 42:1 "Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one [in whom] My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations.
23»ç 42:2 "He will not cry out or raise [His voice,] Nor make His voice heard in the street.
23»ç 42:3 "A bruised reed He will not break, And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice.
23»ç 42:4 "He will not be disheartened or crushed, Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law."
23»ç 42:5 Thus says God the LORD, Who created the heavens and stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and its offspring, Who gives breath to the people on it, And spirit to those who walk in it,
23»ç 42:6 "I am the LORD, I have called you in righteousness, I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you, And I will appoint you as a covenant to the people, As a light to the nations,
23»ç 42:7 To open blind eyes, To bring out prisoners from the dungeon, And those who dwell in darkness from the prison.
23»ç 42:8 "I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to graven images.
23»ç 42:9 "Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim [them] to you."
23»ç 42:10 Sing to the LORD a new song, [Sing] His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it. You islands and those who dwell on them.
23»ç 42:11 Let the wilderness and its cities lift up [their voices,] The settlements where Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud, Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.
23»ç 42:12 Let them give glory to the LORD, And declare His praise in the coastlands.
23»ç 42:13 The LORD will go forth like a warrior, He will arouse [His] zeal like a man of war. He will utter a shout, yes, He will raise a war cry. He will prevail against His enemies.
23»ç 42:14 "I have kept silent for a long time, I have kept still and restrained Myself. [Now] like a woman in labor I will groan, I will both gasp and pant.
23»ç 42:15 "I will lay waste the mountains and hills, And wither all their vegetation; I will make the rivers into coastlands, And dry up the ponds.
23»ç 42:16 "And I will lead the blind by a way they do not know, In paths they do not know I will guide them. I will make darkness into light before them And rugged places into plains. These are the things I will do, And I will not leave them undone."
23»ç 42:17 They shall be turned back and be utterly put to shame, Who trust in idols, Who say to molten images, "You are our gods."
23»ç 42:18 Hear, you deaf! And look, you blind, that you may see.
23»ç 42:19 Who is blind but My servant, Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as he that is at peace [with Me,] Or so blind as the servant of the LORD?
23»ç 42:20 You have seen many things, but you do not observe [them]; [Your] ears are open, but none hears.
23»ç 42:21 The LORD was pleased for His righteousness' sake To make the law great and glorious.
23»ç 42:22 But this is a people plundered and despoiled; All of them are trapped in caves, Or are hidden away in prisons; They have become a prey with none to deliver [them,] And a spoil, with none to say, "Give [them] back!"
23»ç 42:23 Who among you will give ear to this? Who will give heed and listen hereafter?
23»ç 42:24 Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned, And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, And whose law they did not obey?
23»ç 42:25 So He poured out on him the heat of His anger And the fierceness of battle; And it set him aflame all around, Yet he did not recognize [it;] And it burned him, but he paid no attention.
23»ç 43:1 But now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, And He who formed you, O Israel, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine!
23»ç 43:2 "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you.
23»ç 43:3 "For I am the LORD your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.
23»ç 43:4 "Since you are precious in My sight, [Since] you are honored and I love you, I will give [other] men in your place and [other] peoples in exchange for your life.
23»ç 43:5 "Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, And gather you from the west.

23»ç 51:2 "Look to Abraham your father, And to Sarah who gave birth to you in pain; When [he was] one I called him, Then I blessed him and multiplied him."
23»ç 51:3 Indeed, the LORD will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places. And her wilderness He will make like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD; Joy and gladness will be found in her, Thanksgiving and sound of a melody.
23»ç 51:4 "Pay attention to Me, O My people; And give ear to Me, O My nation; For a law will go forth from Me, And I will set My justice for a light of the peoples.
23»ç 51:5 "My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms will judge the peoples; The coastlands will wait for Me, And for My arm they will wait expectantly.
23»ç 51:6 "Lift up your eyes to the sky, Then look to the earth beneath; For the sky will vanish like smoke, And the earth will wear out like a garment, And its inhabitants will die in like manner, But My salvation shall be forever, And My righteousness shall not wane.
23»ç 51:7 "Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, A people in whose heart is My law; Do not fear the reproach of man, Neither be dismayed at their revilings.
23»ç 51:8 "For the moth will eat them like a garment, And the grub will eat them like wool. But My righteousness shall be forever, And My salvation to all generations."
23»ç 51:9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; Awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not Thou who cut Rahab in pieces, Who pierced the dragon?
23»ç 51:10 Was it not Thou who dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep; Who made the depths of the sea a pathway For the redeemed to cross over?
23»ç 51:11 So the ransomed of the LORD will return, And come with joyful shouting to Zion; And everlasting joy [will be] on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23»ç 51:12 "I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies, And of the son of man who is made like grass;
23»ç 51:13 That you have forgotten the LORD your Maker, Who stretched out the heavens, And laid the foundations of the earth; That you fear continually all day long because of the fury of the oppressor, As he makes ready to destroy? But where is the fury of the oppressor?
23»ç 51:14 "The exile will soon be set free, and will not die in the dungeon, nor will his bread be lacking.
23»ç 51:15 "For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar (the LORD of hosts is His name).
23»ç 51:16 "And I have put My words in your mouth, and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, 'You are My people.'"
23»ç 51:17 Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! Arise, O Jerusalem, You who have drunk from the Lord's hand the cup of His anger; The chalice of reeling you have drained to the dregs.
23»ç 51:18 There is none to guide her among all the sons she has borne; Nor is there one to take her by the hand among all the sons she has reared.
23»ç 51:19 These two things have befallen you; Who will mourn for you? The devastation and destruction, famine and sword; How shall I comfort you?
23»ç 51:20 Your sons have fainted, They lie [helpless] at the head of every street, Like an antelope in a net, Full of the wrath of the LORD, The rebuke of your God.
23»ç 51:21 Therefore, please hear this, you afflicted, Who are drunk, but not with wine£º
23»ç 51:22 Thus says your Lord, the LORD, even your God Who contends for His people, "Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of reeling; The chalice of My anger, You will never drink it again.
23»ç 51:23 "And I will put it into the hand of your tormentors, Who have said to you, 'Lie down that we may walk over you.' You have even made your back like the ground, And like the street for those who walk over [it]."
23»ç 52:1 Awake, awake, Clothe yourself in your strength, O Zion; Clothe yourself in your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For the uncircumcised and the unclean Will no more come into you.
23»ç 52:2 Shake yourself from the dust, rise up, O captive Jerusalem; Loose yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
23»ç 52:3 For thus says the LORD, "You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed without money."
23»ç 52:4 For thus says the Lord GOD, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to reside there, then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
23»ç 52:5 "Now therefore, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without cause?" [Again] the LORD declares, "Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.
23»ç 52:6 "Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking, 'Here I am.'"
23»ç 52:7 How lovely on the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness, Who announces salvation, [And] says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"
23»ç 52:8 Listen! Your watchmen lift up [their] voices, They shout joyfully together; For they will see with their own eyes When the LORD restores Zion.
23»ç 52:9 Break forth, shout joyfully together, You waste places of Jerusalem; For the LORD has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem.
23»ç 52:10 The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God.
23»ç 52:11 Depart, depart, go out from there, Touch nothing unclean; Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves, You who carry the vessels of the LORD.
23»ç 52:12 But you will not go out in haste, Nor will you go as fugitives; For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel [will be] your rear guard.
23»ç 52:13 Behold, My servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up, and greatly exalted.
23»ç 52:14 Just as many were astonished at you, [My people,] So His appearance was marred more than any man, And His form more than the sons of men.
23»ç 52:15 Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him; For what had not been told them they will see, And what they had not heard they will understand.
23»ç 53:1 Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
23»ç 53:2 For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root out of parched ground; He has no [stately] form or majesty That we should look upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.
23»ç 53:3 He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face, He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
23»ç 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.
23»ç 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being [fell] upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.
23»ç 53:6 All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.
23»ç 53:7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth.
23»ç 53:8 By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living, For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke [was due?]
23»ç 53:9 His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
23»ç 53:10 But the LORD was pleased To crush Him, putting [Him] to grief; If He would render Himself [as] a guilt offering, He will see [His] offspring, He will prolong [His] days, And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.
23»ç 53:11 As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see [it] and be satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, As He will bear their iniquities.
23»ç 53:12 Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death, And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the transgressors.
23»ç 54:1 "Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no [child;] Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed; For the sons of the desolate one [will be] more numerous Than the sons of the married woman," says the LORD.
23»ç 54:2 "Enlarge the place of your tent; Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not; Lengthen your cords, And strengthen your pegs.
23»ç 54:3 "For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left. And your descendants will possess nations, And they will resettle the desolate cities.
23»ç 54:4 "Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; Neither feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced; But you will forget the shame of your youth, And the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more.
23»ç 54:5 "For your husband is your Maker, Whose name is the LORD of hosts; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Who is called the God of all the earth.
23»ç 54:6 "For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of [one's] youth when she is rejected," Says your God.
23»ç 54:7 "For a brief moment I forsook you, But with great compassion I will gather you.
23»ç 54:8 "In an outburst of anger I hid My face from you for a moment; But with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you," Says the LORD your Redeemer.
23»ç 54:9 "For this is like the days of Noah to Me; When I swore that the waters of Noah Should not flood the earth again, So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, Nor will I rebuke you.
23»ç 54:10 "For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake, But My lovingkindness will not be removed from you, And My covenant of peace will not be shaken," Says the LORD who has compassion on you.
23»ç 54:11 "O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, Behold, I will set your stones in antimony, And your foundations I will lay in sapphires.

23»ç 54:14 "In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you.
23»ç 54:15 "If anyone fiercely assails [you] it will not be from Me. Whoever assails you will fall because of you.
23»ç 54:16 "Behold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, And brings out a weapon for its work; And I have created the destroyer to ruin.
23»ç 54:17 "No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me," declares the LORD.
23»ç 55:1 "Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and without cost.
23»ç 55:2 "Why do you spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, And delight yourself in abundance.
23»ç 55:3 "Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, [According to] the faithful mercies shown to David.
23»ç 55:4 "Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples, A leader and commander for the peoples.
23»ç 55:5 "Behold, you will call a nation you do not know, And a nation which knows you not will run to you, Because of the LORD your God, even the Holy One of Israel; For He has glorified you."
23»ç 55:6 Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near.
23»ç 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him; And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon.
23»ç 55:8 "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Neither are your ways My ways," declares the LORD.
23»ç 55:9 "For [as] the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.
23»ç 55:10 "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth, And making it bear and sprout, And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;

23»ç 55:12 "For you will go out with joy, And be led forth with peace; The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you, And all the trees of the field will clap [their] hands.
23»ç 55:13 "Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up; And instead of the nettle the myrtle will come up; And it will be a memorial to the LORD, For an everlasting sign which will not be cut off."
23»ç 56:1 Thus says the LORD, "Preserve justice, and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come And My righteousness to be revealed.

23»ç 56:11 And the dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no understanding; They have all turned to their own way, Each one to his unjust gain, to the last one.
23»ç 56:12 "Come," [they say,] "let us get wine, and let us drink heavily of strong drink; And tomorrow will be like today, only more so."
23»ç 57:1 The righteous man perishes, and no man takes it to heart; And devout men are taken away, while no one understands. For the righteous man is taken away from evil,

23»ç 58:14 Then you will take delight in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; And I will feed you [with] the heritage of Jacob your father, For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. "
23»ç 59:1 Behold, the Lord's hand is not so short That it cannot save; Neither is His ear so dull That it cannot hear.
23»ç 59:2 But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, And your sins have hidden [His] face from you, so that He does not hear.
23»ç 59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, And your fingers with iniquity; Your lips have spoken falsehood, Your tongue mutters wickedness.
23»ç 59:4 No one sues righteously and no one pleads honestly. They trust in confusion, and speak lies; They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
23»ç 59:5 They hatch adders' eggs and weave the spider's web; He who eats of their eggs dies, And [from] that which is crushed a snake breaks forth.
23»ç 59:6 Their webs will not become clothing, Nor will they cover themselves with their works; Their works are works of iniquity, And an act of violence is in their hands.
23»ç 59:7 Their feet run to evil, And they hasten to shed innocent blood; Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; Devastation and destruction are in their highways.
23»ç 59:8 They do not know the way of peace, And there is no justice in their tracks; They have made their paths crooked; Whoever treads on them does not know peace.
23»ç 59:9 Therefore, justice is far from us, And righteousness does not overtake us; We hope for light, but behold, darkness; For brightness, but we walk in gloom.
23»ç 59:10 We grope along the wall like blind men, We grope like those who have no eyes; We stumble at midday as in the twilight, Among those who are vigorous we are like dead men.
23»ç 59:11 All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none, For salvation, [but] it is far from us.
23»ç 59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied before Thee, And our sins testify against us; For our transgressions are with us, And we know our iniquities£º
23»ç 59:13 Transgressing and denying the LORD, And turning away from our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving [in] and uttering from the heart lying words.
23»ç 59:14 And justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot enter.
23»ç 59:15 Yes, truth is lacking; And he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. Now the LORD saw, And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.
23»ç 59:16 And He saw that there was no man, And was astonished that there was no one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him; And His righteousness upheld Him.
23»ç 59:17 And He put on righteousness like a breastplate, And a helmet of salvation on His head; And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle.
23»ç 59:18 According to [their] deeds, so He will repay, Wrath to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will make recompense.
23»ç 59:19 So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory from the rising of the sun, For He will come like a rushing stream, Which the wind of the LORD drives.
23»ç 59:20 "And a Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob," declares the LORD.
23»ç 59:21 "And as for Me, this is My covenant with them," says the LORD£º " My Spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's offspring, "says the LORD," from now and forever. "
23»ç 60:1 "Arise, shine; for your light has come, And the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.
23»ç 60:2 "For behold, darkness will cover the earth, And deep darkness the peoples; But the LORD will rise upon you, And His glory will appear upon you.
23»ç 60:3 "And nations will come to your light, And kings to the brightness of your rising.
23»ç 60:4 "Lift up your eyes round about, and see; They all gather together, they come to you. Your sons will come from afar, And your daughters will be carried in the arms.

23»ç 60:8 "Who are these who fly like a cloud, And like the doves to their lattices?
23»ç 60:9 "Surely the coastlands will wait for Me; And the ships of Tarshish [ will come] first, To bring your sons from afar, Their silver and their gold with them, For the name of the LORD your God, And for the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you.
23»ç 60:10 "And foreigners will build up your walls, And their kings will minister to you; For in My wrath I struck you, And in My favor I have had compassion on you.
23»ç 60:11 "And your gates will be open continually; They will not be closed day or night, So that [men] may bring to you the wealth of the nations, With their kings led in procession.
23»ç 60:12 "For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve you will perish, And the nations will be utterly ruined.
23»ç 60:13 "The glory of Lebanon will come to you, The juniper, the box tree, and the cypress together, To beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I shall make the place of My feet glorious.
23»ç 60:14 "And the sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, And all those who despised you will bow themselves at the soles of your feet; And they will call you the city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23»ç 60:15 "Whereas you have been forsaken and hated With no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, A joy from generation to generation.
23»ç 60:16 "You will also suck the milk of nations, And will suck the breast of kings; Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23»ç 60:17 "Instead of bronze I will bring gold, And instead of iron I will bring silver, And instead of wood, bronze, And instead of stones, iron. And I will make peace your administrators, And righteousness your overseers.

23»ç 60:22 "The smallest one will become a clan, And the least one a mighty nation. I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time."
23»ç 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives, And freedom to prisoners;
23»ç 61:2 To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD, And the day of vengeance of our God; To comfort all who mourn,
23»ç 61:3 To grant those who mourn [in] Zion, Giving them a garland instead of ashes, The oil of gladness instead of mourning, The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
23»ç 61:4 Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins, They will raise up the former devastations, And they will repair the ruined cities, The desolations of many generations.
23»ç 61:5 And strangers will stand and pasture your flocks, And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.
23»ç 61:6 But you will be called the priests of the LORD; You will be spoken of [as] ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations, And in their riches you will boast.

23»ç 63:12 Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, Who divided the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name,
23»ç 63:13 Who led them through the depths? Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble;
23»ç 63:14 As the cattle which go down into the valley, The Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So didst Thou lead Thy people, To make for Thyself a glorious name.
23»ç 63:15 Look down from heaven, and see from Thy holy and glorious habitation; Where are Thy zeal and Thy mighty deeds? The stirrings of Thy heart and Thy compassion are restrained toward me.
23»ç 63:16 For Thou art our Father, though Abraham does not know us, And Israel does not recognize us. Thou, O LORD, art our Father, Our Redeemer from of old is Thy name.
23»ç 63:17 Why, O LORD, dost Thou cause us to stray from Thy ways, And harden our heart from fearing Thee? Return for the sake of Thy servants, the tribes of Thy heritage.

23»ç 63:19 We have become [like] those over whom Thou hast never ruled, [Like] those who were not called by Thy name.
23»ç 64:1 Oh, that Thou wouldst rend the heavens [and] come down, That the mountains might quake at Thy presence--

23»ç 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
23»ç 64:7 And there is no one who calls on Thy name, Who arouses himself to take hold of Thee; For Thou hast hidden Thy face from us, And hast delivered us into the power of our iniquities.
23»ç 64:8 But now, O LORD, Thou art our Father, We are the clay, and Thou our potter; And all of us are the work of Thy hand.
23»ç 64:9 Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD, Neither remember iniquity forever; Behold, look now, all of us are Thy people.
23»ç 64:10 Thy holy cities have become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
23»ç 64:11 Our holy and beautiful house, Where our fathers praised Thee, Has been burned [by] fire; And all our precious things have become a ruin.
23»ç 64:12 Wilt Thou restrain Thyself at these things, O LORD? Wilt Thou keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
23»ç 65:1 "I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask [for Me;] I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To a nation which did not call on My name.

23»ç 65:5 "Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, For I am holier than you!' These are smoke in My nostrils, A fire that burns all the day.
23»ç 65:6 "Behold, it is written before Me, I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will even repay into their bosom,
23»ç 65:7 Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together, "says the LORD." Because they have burned incense on the mountains, And scorned Me on the hills, Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom. "
23»ç 65:8 Thus says the LORD, "As the new wine is found in the cluster, And one says, 'Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,' So I will act on behalf of My servants In order not to destroy all of them.
23»ç 65:9 "And I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, And an heir of My mountains from Judah; Even My chosen ones shall inherit it, And My servants shall dwell there.
23»ç 65:10 "And Sharon shall be a pasture land for flocks, And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds, For My people who seek Me.

23»ç 65:13 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame.
23»ç 65:14 "Behold, My servants shall shout joyfully with a glad heart, But you shall cry out with a heavy heart, And you shall wail with a broken spirit.
23»ç 65:15 "And you will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones, And the Lord GOD will slay you. But My servants will be called by another name.

23»ç 65:18 "But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; For behold, I create Jerusalem [for] rejoicing, And her people [for] gladness.
23»ç 65:19 "I will also rejoice in Jerusalem, and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.
23»ç 65:20 "No longer will there be in it an infant [who lives but a few] days, Or an old man who does not live out his days; For the youth will die at the age of one hundred And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred Shall be [thought] accursed.
23»ç 65:21 "And they shall build houses and inhabit [them;] They shall also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23»ç 65:22 "They shall not build, and another inhabit, They shall not plant, and another eat; For as the lifetime of a tree, [so shall be] the days of My people, And My chosen ones shall wear out the work of their hands.
23»ç 65:23 "They shall not labor in vain, Or bear [children] for calamity; For they are the offspring of those blessed by the LORD, And their descendants with them.

As they have chosen their [own] ways, And their soul delights in their abominations,
23»ç 66:4 So I will choose their punishments, And I will bring on them what they dread. Because I called, but no one answered; I spoke, but they did not listen. And they did evil in My sight, And chose that in which I did not delight. "
