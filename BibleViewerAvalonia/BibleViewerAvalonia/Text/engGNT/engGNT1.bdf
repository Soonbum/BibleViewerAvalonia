01Gn 1:1 In the beginning, when God created the universe, 
01Gn 1:2 the earth was formless and desolate. The raging ocean that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the Spirit of God was moving over the water. 
01Gn 1:3 Then God commanded, "Let there be light" - and light appeared. 
01Gn 1:4 God was pleased with what he saw. Then he separated the light from the darkness, 
01Gn 1:5 and he named the light "Day" and the darkness "Night." Evening passed and morning came - that was the first day. 
01Gn 1:6 Then God commanded, "Let there be a dome to divide the water and to keep it in two separate places" - 
01Gn 1:7 and it was done. So God made a dome, and it separated the water under it from the water above it. 
01Gn 1:8 He named the dome "Sky." Evening passed and morning came - that was the second day. 
01Gn 1:9 Then God commanded, "Let the water below the sky come together in one place, so that the land will appear" - and it was done. 
01Gn 1:10 He named the land "Earth," and the water which had come together he named "Sea." And God was pleased with what he saw. 
01Gn 1:11 Then he commanded, "Let the earth produce all kinds of plants, those that bear grain and those that bear fruit" - and it was done. 
01Gn 1:12 So the earth produced all kinds of plants, and God was pleased with what he saw. 
01Gn 1:13 Evening passed and morning came - that was the third day. 
01Gn 1:14 Then God commanded, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate day from night and to show the time when days, years, and religious festivals begin; 
01Gn 1:15 they will shine in the sky to give light to the earth" - and it was done. 
01Gn 1:16 So God made the two larger lights, the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule over the night; he also made the stars. 
01Gn 1:17 He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth, 
01Gn 1:18 to rule over the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God was pleased with what he saw. 
01Gn 1:19 Evening passed and morning came - that was the fourth day. 
01Gn 1:20 Then God commanded, "Let the water be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let the air be filled with birds." 
01Gn 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters, all kinds of creatures that live in the water, and all kinds of birds. And God was pleased with what he saw. 
01Gn 1:22 He blessed them all and told the creatures that live in the water to reproduce and to fill the sea, and he told the birds to increase in number. 
01Gn 1:23 Evening passed and morning came - that was the fifth day. 
01Gn 1:24 Then God commanded, "Let the earth produce all kinds of animal life£º domestic and wild, large and small" - and it was done. 
01Gn 1:25 So God made them all, and he was pleased with what he saw. 
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "And now we will make human beings; they will be like us and resemble us. They will have power over the fish, the birds, and all animals, domestic and wild, large and small." 
01Gn 1:27 So God created human beings, making them to be like himself. He created them male and female, 
01Gn 1:28 blessed them, and said, "Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control. I am putting you in charge of the fish, the birds, and all the wild animals. 
01Gn 1:29 I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to eat; 
01Gn 1:30 but for all the wild animals and for all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food" - and it was done. 
01Gn 1:31 God looked at everything he had made, and he was very pleased. Evening passed and morning came - that was the sixth day. 
01Gn 2:1 And so the whole universe was completed. 
01Gn 2:2 By the seventh day God finished what he had been doing and stopped working. 
01Gn 2:3 He blessed the seventh day and set it apart as a special day, because by that day he had completed his creation and stopped working. 
01Gn 2:4 And that is how the universe was created. When the LORD God made the universe, 
01Gn 2:5 there were no plants on the earth and no seeds had sprouted, because he had not sent any rain, and there was no one to cultivate the land; 
01Gn 2:6 but water would come up from beneath the surface and water the ground. 
01Gn 2:7 Then the LORD God took some soil from the ground and formed a man out of it; he breathed life-giving breath into his nostrils and the man began to live. 
01Gn 2:8 Then the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the East, and there he put the man he had formed. 
01Gn 2:9 He made all kinds of beautiful trees grow there and produce good fruit. In the middle of the garden stood the tree that gives life and the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. 
01Gn 2:10 A stream flowed in Eden and watered the garden; beyond Eden it divided into four rivers. 
01Gn 2:11 The first river is the Pishon; it flows around the country of Havilah. 
01Gn 2:12 (Pure gold is found there and also rare perfume and precious stones.) 
01Gn 2:13 The second river is the Gihon; it flows around the country of Cush. 
01Gn 2:14 The third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria, and the fourth river is the Euphrates. 
01Gn 2:15 Then the LORD God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to cultivate it and guard it. 
01Gn 2:16 He told him, "You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, 
01Gn 2:17 except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do, you will die the same day." 
01Gn 2:18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to live alone. I will make a suitable companion to help him." 
01Gn 2:19 So he took some soil from the ground and formed all the animals and all the birds. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and that is how they all got their names. 
01Gn 2:20 So the man named all the birds and all the animals; but not one of them was a suitable companion to help him. 
01Gn 2:21 Then the LORD God made the man fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took out one of the man's ribs and closed up the flesh. 
01Gn 2:22 He formed a woman out of the rib and brought her to him. 
01Gn 2:23 Then the man said, "At last, here is one of my own kind - Bone taken from my bone, and flesh from my flesh. 'Woman' is her name because she was taken out of man." 
01Gn 2:24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united with his wife, and they become one. 
01Gn 2:25 The man and the woman were both naked, but they were not embarrassed. 
01Gn 3:1 Now the snake was the most cunning animal that the LORD God had made. The snake asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?" 
01Gn 3:2 "We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden," the woman answered, 
01Gn 3:3 "except the tree in the middle of it. God told us not to eat the fruit of that tree or even touch it; if we do, we will die." 
01Gn 3:4 The snake replied, "That's not true; you will not die. 
01Gn 3:5 God said that because he knows that when you eat it, you will be like God and know what is good and what is bad." 
01Gn 3:6 The woman saw how beautiful the tree was and how good its fruit would be to eat, and she thought how wonderful it would be to become wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he also ate it. 
01Gn 3:7 As soon as they had eaten it, they were given understanding and realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves. 
01Gn 3:8 That evening they heard the LORD God walking in the garden, and they hid from him among the trees. 
01Gn 3:9 But the LORD God called out to the man, "Where are you?" 
01Gn 3:10 He answered, "I heard you in the garden; I was afraid and hid from you, because I was naked." 
01Gn 3:11 "Who told you that you were naked?" God asked. "Did you eat the fruit that I told you not to eat?" 
01Gn 3:12 The man answered, "The woman you put here with me gave me the fruit, and I ate it." 
01Gn 3:13 The LORD God asked the woman, "Why did you do this?" She replied, "The snake tricked me into eating it." 
01Gn 3:14 Then the LORD God said to the snake, "You will be punished for this; you alone of all the animals must bear this curse£º From now on you will crawl on your belly, and you will have to eat dust as long as you live. 
01Gn 3:15 I will make you and the woman hate each other; her offspring and yours will always be enemies. Her offspring will crush your head, and you will bite her offspring's heel." 
01Gn 3:16 And he said to the woman, "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy and your pain in giving birth. In spite of this, you will still have desire for your husband, yet you will be subject to him." 
01Gn 3:17 And he said to the man, "You listened to your wife and ate the fruit which I told you not to eat. Because of what you have done, the ground will be under a curse. You will have to work hard all your life to make it produce enough food for you. 
01Gn 3:18 It will produce weeds and thorns, and you will have to eat wild plants. 
01Gn 3:19 You will have to work hard and sweat to make the soil produce anything, until you go back to the soil from which you were formed. You were made from soil, and you will become soil again." 
01Gn 3:20 Adam named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all human beings. 
01Gn 3:21 And the LORD God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and his wife, and he clothed them. 
01Gn 3:22 Then the LORD God said, "Now these human beings have become like one of us and have knowledge of what is good and what is bad. They must not be allowed to take fruit from the tree that gives life, eat it, and live forever." 
01Gn 3:23 So the LORD God sent them out of the Garden of Eden and made them cultivate the soil from which they had been formed. 
01Gn 3:24 Then at the east side of the garden he put living creatures and a flaming sword which turned in all directions. This was to keep anyone from coming near the tree that gives life. 
01Gn 4:1 Then Adam had intercourse with his wife, and she became pregnant. She bore a son and said, "By the LORD's help I have gotten a son." So she named him Cain. 
01Gn 4:2 Later she gave birth to another son, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, but Cain was a farmer. 
01Gn 4:3 After some time Cain brought some of his harvest and gave it as an offering to the LORD. 
01Gn 4:4 Then Abel brought the first lamb born to one of his sheep, killed it, and gave the best parts of it as an offering. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering, 
01Gn 4:5 but he rejected Cain and his offering. Cain became furious, and he scowled in anger. 
01Gn 4:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why that scowl on your face? 
01Gn 4:7 If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling; but because you have done evil, sin is crouching at your door. It wants to rule you, but you must overcome it." 
01Gn 4:8 Then Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out in the fields." When they were out in the fields, Cain turned on his brother and killed him. 
01Gn 4:9 The LORD asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He answered, "I don't know. Am I supposed to take care of my brother?" 
01Gn 4:10 Then the LORD said, "Why have you done this terrible thing? Your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground, like a voice calling for revenge. 
01Gn 4:11 You are placed under a curse and can no longer farm the soil. It has soaked up your brother's blood as if it had opened its mouth to receive it when you killed him. 
01Gn 4:12 If you try to grow crops, the soil will not produce anything; you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth." 
01Gn 4:13 And Cain said to the LORD, "This punishment is too hard for me to bear. 
01Gn 4:14 You are driving me off the land and away from your presence. I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me." 
01Gn 4:15 But the LORD answered, "No. If anyone kills you, seven lives will be taken in revenge." So the LORD put a mark on Cain to warn anyone who met him not to kill him. 
01Gn 4:16 And Cain went away from the LORD's presence and lived in a land called "Wandering," which is east of Eden. 
01Gn 4:17 Cain and his wife had a son and named him Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son. 
01Gn 4:18 Enoch had a son named Irad, who was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael had a son named Methushael, who was the father of Lamech. 
01Gn 4:19 Lamech had two wives, Adah and Zillah. 
01Gn 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the ancestor of those who raise livestock and live in tents. 
01Gn 4:21 His brother was Jubal, the ancestor of all musicians who play the harp and the flute. 
01Gn 4:22 Zillah gave birth to Tubal Cain, who made all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal Cain was Naamah. 
01Gn 4:23 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me£º I have killed a young man because he struck me. 
01Gn 4:24 If seven lives are taken to pay for killing Cain, Seventy-seven will be taken if anyone kills me." 
01Gn 4:25 Adam and his wife had another son. She said, "God has given me a son to replace Abel, whom Cain killed." So she named him Seth. 
01Gn 4:26 Seth had a son whom he named Enosh. It was then that people began using the LORD's holy name in worship. 
01Gn 5:1 This is the list of the descendants of Adam. (When God created human beings, he made them like himself. 
01Gn 5:2 He created them male and female, blessed them, and named them "Human Beings.") 
01Gn 5:3 When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son who was like him, and he named him Seth. 
01Gn 5:4 After that, Adam lived another 800 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:5 and died at the age of 930. 
01Gn 5:6 When Seth was 105, he had a son, Enosh, 
01Gn 5:7 and then lived another 807 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:8 and died at the age of 912. 
01Gn 5:9 When Enosh was 90, he had a son, Kenan, 
01Gn 5:10 and then lived another 815 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:11 and died at the age of 905. 
01Gn 5:12 When Kenan was 70, he had a son, Mahalalel, 
01Gn 5:13 and then lived another 840 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:14 and died at the age of 910. 
01Gn 5:15 When Mahalalel was 65, he had a son, Jared, 
01Gn 5:16 and then lived another 830 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:17 and died at the age of 895. 
01Gn 5:18 When Jared was 162, he had a son, Enoch, 
01Gn 5:19 and then lived another 800 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:20 and died at the age of 962. 
01Gn 5:21 When Enoch was 65, he had a son, Methuselah. 
01Gn 5:22 After that, Enoch lived in fellowship with God for 300 years and had other children. 
01Gn 5:23 He lived to be 365 years old. 
01Gn 5:24 He spent his life in fellowship with God, and then he disappeared, because God took him away. 
01Gn 5:25 When Methuselah was 187, he had a son, Lamech, 
01Gn 5:26 and then lived another 782 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:27 and died at the age of 969. 
01Gn 5:28 When Lamech was 182, he had a son 
01Gn 5:29 and said, "From the very ground on which the LORD put a curse, this child will bring us relief from all our hard work"; so he named him Noah. 
01Gn 5:30 Lamech lived another 595 years. He had other children 
01Gn 5:31 and died at the age of 777. 
01Gn 5:32 After Noah was 500 years old, he had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
01Gn 6:1 When people had spread all over the world, and daughters were being born, 
01Gn 6:2 some of the heavenly beings saw that these young women were beautiful, so they took the ones they liked. 
01Gn 6:3 Then the LORD said, "I will not allow people to live forever; they are mortal. From now on they will live no longer than 120 years." 
01Gn 6:4 In those days, and even later, there were giants on the earth who were descendants of human women and the heavenly beings. They were the great heroes and famous men of long ago. 
01Gn 6:5 When the LORD saw how wicked everyone on earth was and how evil their thoughts were all the time, 
01Gn 6:6 he was sorry that he had ever made them and put them on the earth. He was so filled with regret 
01Gn 6:7 that he said, "I will wipe out these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry that I made any of them." 
01Gn 6:8 But the LORD was pleased with Noah. 
01Gn 6:9 This is the story of Noah. He had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
01Gn 6:10 Noah had no faults and was the only good man of his time. He lived in fellowship with God,
01Gn 6:11 but everyone else was evil in God's sight, and violence had spread everywhere. 
01Gn 6:12 God looked at the world and saw that it was evil, for the people were all living evil lives. 
01Gn 6:13 God said to Noah, "I have decided to put an end to all people. I will destroy them completely, because the world is full of their violent deeds. 
01Gn 6:14 Build a boat for yourself out of good timber; make rooms in it and cover it with tar inside and out. 
01Gn 6:15 Make it 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
01Gn 6:16 Make a roof for the boat and leave a space of 18 inches between the roof and the sides. Build it with three decks and put a door in the side. 
01Gn 6:17 I am going to send a flood on the earth to destroy every living being. Everything on the earth will die, 
01Gn 6:18 but I will make a covenant with you. Go into the boat with your wife, your sons, and their wives. 
01Gn 6:19 Take into the boat with you a male and a female of every kind of animal and of every kind of bird,
01Gn 6:20 in order to keep them alive. 
01Gn 6:21 Take along all kinds of food for you and for them." 
01Gn 6:22 Noah did everything that God commanded. 
01Gn 7:1 The LORD said to Noah, "Go into the boat with your whole family; I have found that you are the only one in all the world who does what is right. 
01Gn 7:2 Take with you seven pairs of each kind of ritually clean animal, but only one pair of each kind of unclean animal. 
01Gn 7:3 Take also seven pairs of each kind of bird. Do this so that every kind of animal and bird will be kept alive to reproduce again on the earth. 
01Gn 7:4 Seven days from now I am going to send rain that will fall for forty days and nights, in order to destroy all the living beings that I have made." 
01Gn 7:5 And Noah did everything that the LORD commanded. 
01Gn 7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came on the earth. 
01Gn 7:7 He and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went into the boat to escape the flood. 
01Gn 7:8 A male and a female of every kind of animal and bird, whether ritually clean or unclean, 
01Gn 7:9 went into the boat with Noah, as God had commanded. 
01Gn 7:10 Seven days later the flood came. 
01Gn 7:11 When Noah was six hundred years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month all the outlets of the vast body of water beneath the earth burst open, all the floodgates of the sky were opened, 
01Gn 7:12 and rain fell on the earth for forty days and nights. 
01Gn 7:13 On that same day Noah and his wife went into the boat with their three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives. 
01Gn 7:14 With them went every kind of animal, domestic and wild, large and small, and every kind of bird. 
01Gn 7:15 A male and a female of each kind of living being went into the boat with Noah, 
01Gn 7:16 as God had commanded. Then the LORD shut the door behind Noah. 
01Gn 7:17 The flood continued for forty days, and the water became deep enough for the boat to float. 
01Gn 7:18 The water became deeper, and the boat drifted on the surface. 
01Gn 7:19 It became so deep that it covered the highest mountains; 
01Gn 7:20 it went on rising until it was about twenty-five feet above the tops of the mountains. 
01Gn 7:21 Every living being on the earth died - every bird, every animal, and every person. 
01Gn 7:22 Everything on earth that breathed died. 
01Gn 7:23 The LORD destroyed all living beings on the earth - human beings, animals, and birds. The only ones left were Noah and those who were with him in the boat. 
01Gn 7:24 The water did not start going down for a hundred and fifty days. 
01Gn 8:1 God had not forgotten Noah and all the animals with him in the boat; he caused a wind to blow, and the water started going down. 
01Gn 8:2 The outlets of the water beneath the earth and the floodgates of the sky were closed. The rain stopped, 
01Gn 8:3 and the water gradually went down for 150 days. 
01Gn 8:4 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month the boat came to rest on a mountain in the Ararat range. 
01Gn 8:5 The water kept going down, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains appeared. 
01Gn 8:6 After forty days Noah opened a window 
01Gn 8:7 and sent out a raven. It did not come back, but kept flying around until the water was completely gone. 
01Gn 8:8 Meanwhile, Noah sent out a dove to see if the water had gone down, 
01Gn 8:9 but since the water still covered all the land, the dove did not find a place to light. It flew back to the boat, and Noah reached out and took it in. 
01Gn 8:10 He waited another seven days and sent out the dove again. 
01Gn 8:11 It returned to him in the evening with a fresh olive leaf in its beak. So Noah knew that the water had gone down. 
01Gn 8:12 Then he waited another seven days and sent out the dove once more; this time it did not come back. 
01Gn 8:13 When Noah was 601 years old, on the first day of the first month, the water was gone. Noah removed the covering of the boat, looked around, and saw that the ground was getting dry. 
01Gn 8:14 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry. 
01Gn 8:15 God said to Noah, 
01Gn 8:16 "Go out of the boat with your wife, your sons, and their wives. 
01Gn 8:17 Take all the birds and animals out with you, so that they may reproduce and spread over all the earth." 
01Gn 8:18 So Noah went out of the boat with his wife, his sons, and their wives. 
01Gn 8:19 All the animals and birds went out of the boat in groups of their own kind. 
01Gn 8:20 Noah built an altar to the LORD; he took one of each kind of ritually clean animal and bird, and burned them whole as a sacrifice on the altar. 
01Gn 8:21 The odor of the sacrifice pleased the LORD, and he said to himself, "Never again will I put the earth under a curse because of what people do; I know that from the time they are young their thoughts are evil. Never again will I destroy all living beings, as I have done this time. 
01Gn 8:22 As long as the world exists, there will be a time for planting and a time for harvest. There will always be cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night." 
01Gn 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons and said, "Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth. 
01Gn 9:2 All the animals, birds, and fish will live in fear of you. They are all placed under your power. 
01Gn 9:3 Now you can eat them, as well as green plants; I give them all to you for food. 
01Gn 9:4 The one thing you must not eat is meat with blood still in it; I forbid this because the life is in the blood. 
01Gn 9:5 If anyone takes human life, he will be punished. I will punish with death any animal that takes a human life. 
01Gn 9:6 Human beings were made like God, so whoever murders one of them will be killed by someone else. 
01Gn 9:7 "You must have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth." 
01Gn 9:8 God said to Noah and his sons, 
01Gn 9:9 "I am now making my covenant with you and with your descendants, 
01Gn 9:10 and with all living beings - all birds and all animals - everything that came out of the boat with you. 
01Gn 9:11 With these words I make my covenant with you£º I promise that never again will all living beings be destroyed by a flood; never again will a flood destroy the earth. 
01Gn 9:12 As a sign of this everlasting covenant which I am making with you and with all living beings, 
01Gn 9:13 I am putting my bow in the clouds. It will be the sign of my covenant with the world. 
01Gn 9:14 Whenever I cover the sky with clouds and the rainbow appears, 
01Gn 9:15 I will remember my promise to you and to all the animals that a flood will never again destroy all living beings. 
01Gn 9:16 When the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between me and all living beings on earth. 
01Gn 9:17 That is the sign of the promise which I am making to all living beings." 
01Gn 9:18 The sons of Noah who went out of the boat were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 
01Gn 9:19 These three sons of Noah were the ancestors of all the people on earth. 
01Gn 9:20 Noah, who was a farmer, was the first man to plant a vineyard. 
01Gn 9:21 After he drank some of the wine, he became drunk, took off his clothes, and lay naked in his tent. 
01Gn 9:22 When Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked, he went out and told his two brothers. 
01Gn 9:23 Then Shem and Japheth took a robe and held it behind them on their shoulders. They walked backward into the tent and covered their father, keeping their faces turned away so as not to see him naked. 
01Gn 9:24 When Noah sobered up and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
01Gn 9:25 he said, "A curse on Canaan! He will be a slave to his brothers. 
01Gn 9:26 Give praise to the LORD, the God of Shem! Canaan will be the slave of Shem. 
01Gn 9:27 May God cause Japheth to increase! May his descendants live with the people of Shem! Canaan will be the slave of Japheth." 
01Gn 9:28 After the flood Noah lived 350 years 
01Gn 9:29 and died at the age of 950. 
01Gn 10:1 These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These three had sons after the flood. 
01Gn 10:2 The sons of Japheth - Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras - were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
01Gn 10:3 The descendants of Gomer were the people of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
01Gn 10:4 The descendants of Javan were the people of Elishah, Spain, Cyprus, and Rhodes; 
01Gn 10:5 they were the ancestors of the people who live along the coast and on the islands. These are the descendants of Japheth, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language. 
01Gn 10:6 The sons of Ham - Cush, Egypt, Libya, and Canaan - were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
01Gn 10:7 The descendants of Cush were the people of Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were the people of Sheba and Dedan. 
01Gn 10:8 Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the world's first great conqueror. 
01Gn 10:9 By the LORD's help he was a great hunter, and that is why people say, "May the LORD make you as great a hunter as Nimrod!" 
01Gn 10:10 At first his kingdom included Babylon, Erech, and Accad, all three of them in Babylonia. 
01Gn 10:11 From that land he went to Assyria and built the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
01Gn 10:12 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah. 
01Gn 10:13 The descendants of Egypt were the people of Lydia, Anam, Lehab, Naphtuh, 
01Gn 10:14 Pathrus, Casluh, and of Crete, from whom the Philistines are descended. 
01Gn 10:15 Canaan's sons - Sidon, the oldest, and Heth - were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
01Gn 10:16 Canaan was also the ancestor of the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
01Gn 10:17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
01Gn 10:18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. The different tribes of the Canaanites spread out, 
01Gn 10:19 until the Canaanite borders reached from Sidon southward to Gerar near Gaza, and eastward to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim near Lasha. 
01Gn 10:20 These are the descendants of Ham, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language. 
01Gn 10:21 Shem, the older brother of Japheth, was the ancestor of all the Hebrews. 
01Gn 10:22 Shem's sons - Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram - were the ancestors of the peoples who bear their names. 
01Gn 10:23 The descendants of Aram were the people of Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshek. 
01Gn 10:24 Arpachshad was the father of Shelah, who was the father of Eber. 
01Gn 10:25 Eber had two sons£º one was named Peleg, because during his time the people of the world were divided; and the other was named Joktan. 
01Gn 10:26 The descendants of Joktan were the people of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
01Gn 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
01Gn 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
01Gn 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All of them were descended from Joktan. 
01Gn 10:30 The land in which they lived extended from Mesha to Sephar in the eastern hill country. 
01Gn 10:31 These are the descendants of Shem, living in their different tribes and countries, each group speaking its own language. 
01Gn 10:32 All these peoples are the descendants of Noah, nation by nation, according to their different lines of descent. After the flood all the nations of the earth were descended from the sons of Noah. 
01Gn 11:1 At first, the people of the whole world had only one language and used the same words. 
01Gn 11:2 As they wandered about in the East, they came to a plain in Babylonia and settled there. 
01Gn 11:3 They said to one another, "Come on! Let's make bricks and bake them hard." So they had bricks to build with and tar to hold them together. 
01Gn 11:4 They said, "Now let's build a city with a tower that reaches the sky, so that we can make a name for ourselves and not be scattered all over the earth." 
01Gn 11:5 Then the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which they had built, 
01Gn 11:6 and he said, "Now then, these are all one people and they speak one language; this is just the beginning of what they are going to do. Soon they will be able to do anything they want! 
01Gn 11:7 Let us go down and mix up their language so that they will not understand each other." 
01Gn 11:8 So the LORD scattered them all over the earth, and they stopped building the city. 
01Gn 11:9 The city was called Babylon, because there the LORD mixed up the language of all the people, and from there he scattered them all over the earth. 
01Gn 11:10 These are the descendants of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he had a son, Arpachshad. 
01Gn 11:11 After that, he lived another 500 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:12 When Arpachshad was 35 years old, he had a son, Shelah; 
01Gn 11:13 after that, he lived another 403 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:14 When Shelah was 30 years old, he had a son, Eber; 
01Gn 11:15 after that, he lived another 403 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:16 When Eber was 34 years old, he had a son, Peleg; 
01Gn 11:17 after that, he lived another 430 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:18 When Peleg was 30 years old, he had a son, Reu; 
01Gn 11:19 after that, he lived another 209 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:20 When Reu was 32 years old, he had a son, Serug; 
01Gn 11:21 after that, he lived another 207 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:22 When Serug was 30 years old, he had a son, Nahor; 
01Gn 11:23 after that, he lived another 200 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:24 When Nahor was 29 years old, he had a son, Terah; 
01Gn 11:25 after that, he lived another 119 years and had other children. 
01Gn 11:26 After Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
01Gn 11:27 These are the descendants of Terah, who was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran was the father of Lot, 
01Gn 11:28 and Haran died in his hometown of Ur in Babylonia, while his father was still living. 
01Gn 11:29 Abram married Sarai, and Nahor married Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah. 
01Gn 11:30 Sarai was not able to have children. 
01Gn 11:31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot, who was the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, Abram's wife, and with them he left the city of Ur in Babylonia to go to the land of Canaan. They went as far as Haran and settled there. 
01Gn 11:32 Terah died there at the age of 205. 
01Gn 12:1 The LORD said to Abram, "Leave your country, your relatives, and your father's home, and go to a land that I am going to show you. 
01Gn 12:2 I will give you many descendants, and they will become a great nation. I will bless you and make your name famous, so that you will be a blessing. 
01Gn 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, But I will curse those who curse you. And through you I will bless all the nations." 
01Gn 12:4 When Abram was seventy-five years old, he started out from Haran, as the LORD had told him to do; and Lot went with him. 
01Gn 12:5 Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the wealth and all the slaves they had acquired in Haran, and they started out for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in Canaan, 
01Gn 12:6 Abram traveled through the land until he came to the sacred tree of Moreh, the holy place at Shechem. (At that time the Canaanites were still living in the land.) 
01Gn 12:7 The LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, "This is the country that I am going to give to your descendants." Then Abram built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him. 
01Gn 12:8 After that, he moved on south to the hill country east of the city of Bethel and set up his camp between Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There also he built an altar and worshiped the LORD. 
01Gn 12:9 Then he moved on from place to place, going toward the southern part of Canaan. 
01Gn 12:10 But there was a famine in Canaan, and it was so bad that Abram went farther south to Egypt, to live there for a while. 
01Gn 12:11 When he was about to cross the border into Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "You are a beautiful woman. 
01Gn 12:12 When the Egyptians see you, they will assume that you are my wife, and so they will kill me and let you live. 
01Gn 12:13 Tell them that you are my sister; then because of you they will let me live and treat me well." 
01Gn 12:14 When he crossed the border into Egypt, the Egyptians did see that his wife was beautiful. 
01Gn 12:15 Some of the court officials saw her and told the king how beautiful she was; so she was taken to his palace. 
01Gn 12:16 Because of her the king treated Abram well and gave him flocks of sheep and goats, cattle, donkeys, slaves, and camels. 
01Gn 12:17 But because the king had taken Sarai, the LORD sent terrible diseases on him and on the people of his palace. 
01Gn 12:18 Then the king sent for Abram and asked him, "What have you done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife? 
01Gn 12:19 Why did you say that she was your sister, and let me take her as my wife? Here is your wife; take her and get out!" 
01Gn 12:20 The king gave orders to his men, so they took Abram and put him out of the country, together with his wife and everything he owned. 
01Gn 13:1 Abram went north out of Egypt to the southern part of Canaan with his wife and everything he owned, and Lot went with him. 
01Gn 13:2 Abram was a very rich man, with sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as silver and gold. 
01Gn 13:3 Then he left there and moved from place to place, going toward Bethel. He reached the place between Bethel and Ai where he had camped before 
01Gn 13:4 and had built an altar. There he worshiped the LORD. 
01Gn 13:5 Lot also had sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as his own family and servants. 
01Gn 13:6 And so there was not enough pasture land for the two of them to stay together, because they had too many animals. 
01Gn 13:7 So quarrels broke out between the men who took care of Abram's animals and those who took care of Lot's animals. (At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were still living in the land.) 
01Gn 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot, "We are relatives, and your men and my men shouldn't be quarreling. 
01Gn 13:9 So let's separate. Choose any part of the land you want. You go one way, and I'll go the other." 
01Gn 13:10 Lot looked around and saw that the whole Jordan Valley, all the way to Zoar, had plenty of water, like the Garden of the LORD or like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD had destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
01Gn 13:11 So Lot chose the whole Jordan Valley for himself and moved away toward the east. That is how the two men parted. 
01Gn 13:12 Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled among the cities in the valley and camped near Sodom, 
01Gn 13:13 whose people were wicked and sinned against the LORD. 
01Gn 13:14 After Lot had left, the LORD said to Abram, "From where you are, look carefully in all directions. 
01Gn 13:15 I am going to give you and your descendants all the land that you see, and it will be yours forever. 
01Gn 13:16 I am going to give you so many descendants that no one will be able to count them all; it would be as easy to count all the specks of dust on earth! 
01Gn 13:17 Now, go and look over the whole land, because I am going to give it all to you." 
01Gn 13:18 So Abram moved his camp and settled near the sacred trees of Mamre at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD. 
01Gn 14:1 Four kings, Amraphel of Babylonia, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim, 
01Gn 14:2 went to war against five other kings£º Bera of Sodom, Birsha of Gomorrah, Shinab of Admah, Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (or Zoar). 
01Gn 14:3 These five kings had formed an alliance and joined forces in Siddim Valley, which is now the Dead Sea. 
01Gn 14:4 They had been under the control of Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him. 
01Gn 14:5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and his allies came with their armies and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in the plain of Kiriathaim, 
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites in the mountains of Edom, pursuing them as far as Elparan on the edge of the desert. 
01Gn 14:7 Then they turned around and came back to Kadesh (then known as Enmishpat). They conquered all the land of the Amalekites and defeated the Amorites who lived in Hazazon Tamar. 
01Gn 14:8 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela drew up their armies for battle in Siddim Valley and fought 
01Gn 14:9 against the kings of Elam, Goiim, Babylonia, and Ellasar, five kings against four. 
01Gn 14:10 The valley was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah tried to run away from the battle, they fell into the pits; but the other three kings escaped to the mountains. 
01Gn 14:11 The four kings took everything in Sodom and Gomorrah, including the food, and went away. 
01Gn 14:12 Lot, Abram's nephew, was living in Sodom, so they took him and all his possessions. 
01Gn 14:13 But a man escaped and reported all this to Abram, the Hebrew, who was living near the sacred trees belonging to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his brothers Eshcol and Aner were Abram's allies. 
01Gn 14:14 When Abram heard that his nephew had been captured, he called together all the fighting men in his camp, 318 in all, and pursued the four kings all the way to Dan. 
01Gn 14:15 There he divided his men into groups, attacked the enemy by night, and defeated them. He chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus, 
01Gn 14:16 and got back all the loot that had been taken. He also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other prisoners. 
01Gn 14:17 When Abram came back from his victory over Chedorlaomer and the other kings, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in Shaveh Valley (also called King's Valley). 
01Gn 14:18 And Melchizedek, who was king of Salem and also a priest of the Most High God, brought bread and wine to Abram, 
01Gn 14:19 blessed him, and said, "May the Most High God, who made heaven and earth, bless Abram! 
01Gn 14:20 May the Most High God, who gave you victory over your enemies, be praised!" And Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the loot he had recovered. 
01Gn 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Keep the loot, but give me back all my people." 
01Gn 14:22 Abram answered, "I solemnly swear before the LORD, the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth, 
01Gn 14:23 that I will not keep anything of yours, not even a thread or a sandal strap. Then you can never say, 'I am the one who made Abram rich.' 
01Gn 14:24 I will take nothing for myself. I will accept only what my men have used. But let my allies, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, take their share." 
01Gn 15:1 After this, Abram had a vision and heard the LORD say to him, "Do not be afraid, Abram. I will shield you from danger and give you a great reward." 
01Gn 15:2 But Abram answered, "Sovereign LORD, what good will your reward do me, since I have no children? My only heir is Eliezer of Damascus. 
01Gn 15:3 You have given me no children, and one of my slaves will inherit my property." 
01Gn 15:4 Then he heard the LORD speaking to him again£º "This slave Eliezer will not inherit your property; your own son will be your heir." 
01Gn 15:5 The LORD took him outside and said, "Look at the sky and try to count the stars; you will have as many descendants as that." 
01Gn 15:6 Abram put his trust in the LORD, and because of this the LORD was pleased with him and accepted him. 
01Gn 15:7 Then the LORD said to him, "I am the LORD, who led you out of Ur in Babylonia, to give you this land as your own." 
01Gn 15:8 But Abram asked, "Sovereign LORD, how can I know that it will be mine?" 
01Gn 15:9 He answered, "Bring me a cow, a goat, and a ram, each of them three years old, and a dove and a pigeon." 
01Gn 15:10 Abram brought the animals to God, cut them in half, and placed the halves opposite each other in two rows; but he did not cut up the birds. 
01Gn 15:11 Vultures came down on the bodies, but Abram drove them off. 
01Gn 15:12 When the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and fear and terror came over him. 
01Gn 15:13 The LORD said to him, "Your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land; they will be slaves there and will be treated cruelly for four hundred years. 
01Gn 15:14 But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and when they leave that foreign land, they will take great wealth with them. 
01Gn 15:15 You yourself will live to a ripe old age, die in peace, and be buried. 
01Gn 15:16 It will be four generations before your descendants come back here, because I will not drive out the Amorites until they become so wicked that they must be punished." 
01Gn 15:17 When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch suddenly appeared and passed between the pieces of the animals. 
01Gn 15:18 Then and there the LORD made a covenant with Abram. He said, "I promise to give your descendants all this land from the border of Egypt to the Euphrates River, 
01Gn 15:19 including the lands of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
01Gn 15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 
01Gn 15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites." 
01Gn 16:1 Abram's wife Sarai had not borne him any children. But she had an Egyptian slave woman named Hagar, 
01Gn 16:2 and so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Why don't you sleep with my slave? Perhaps she can have a child for me." Abram agreed with what Sarai said. 
01Gn 16:3 So she gave Hagar to him to be his concubine. (This happened after Abram had lived in Canaan for ten years.) 
01Gn 16:4 Abram had intercourse with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she found out that she was pregnant, she became proud and despised Sarai. 
01Gn 16:5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "It's your fault that Hagar despises me. I myself gave her to you, and ever since she found out that she was pregnant, she has despised me. May the LORD judge which of us is right, you or me!" 
01Gn 16:6 Abram answered, "Very well, she is your slave and under your control; do whatever you want with her." Then Sarai treated Hagar so cruelly that she ran away. 
01Gn 16:7 The angel of the LORD met Hagar at a spring in the desert on the road to Shur 
01Gn 16:8 and said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She answered, "I am running away from my mistress." 
01Gn 16:9 He said, "Go back to her and be her slave." 
01Gn 16:10 Then he said, "I will give you so many descendants that no one will be able to count them. 
01Gn 16:11 You are going to have a son, and you will name him Ishmael, because the LORD has heard your cry of distress. 
01Gn 16:12 But your son will live like a wild donkey; he will be against everyone, and everyone will be against him. He will live apart from all his relatives." 
01Gn 16:13 Hagar asked herself, "Have I really seen God and lived to tell about it?" So she called the LORD, who had spoken to her, "A God Who Sees." 
01Gn 16:14 That is why people call the well between Kadesh and Bered "The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me." 
01Gn 16:15 Hagar bore Abram a son, and he named him Ishmael. 
01Gn 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old at the time. 
01Gn 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the Almighty God. Obey me and always do what is right. 
01Gn 17:2 I will make my covenant with you and give you many descendants." 
01Gn 17:3 Abram bowed down with his face touching the ground, and God said, 
01Gn 17:4 "I make this covenant with you£º I promise that you will be the ancestor of many nations. 
01Gn 17:5 Your name will no longer be Abram, but Abraham, because I am making you the ancestor of many nations. 
01Gn 17:6 I will give you many descendants, and some of them will be kings. You will have so many descendants that they will become nations. 
01Gn 17:7 "I will keep my promise to you and to your descendants in future generations as an everlasting covenant. I will be your God and the God of your descendants. 
01Gn 17:8 I will give to you and to your descendants this land in which you are now a foreigner. The whole land of Canaan will belong to your descendants forever, and I will be their God." 
01Gn 17:9 God said to Abraham, "You also must agree to keep the covenant with me, both you and your descendants in future generations. 
01Gn 17:10 You and your descendants must all agree to circumcise every male among you. 
01Gn 17:11 From now on you must circumcise every baby boy when he is eight days old, 
01Gn 17:12 including slaves born in your homes and slaves bought from foreigners. This will show that there is a covenant between you and me.
01Gn 17:13 Each one must be circumcised, and this will be a physical sign to show that my covenant with you is everlasting. 
01Gn 17:14 Any male who has not been circumcised will no longer be considered one of my people, because he has not kept the covenant with me." 
01Gn 17:15 God said to Abraham, "You must no longer call your wife Sarai; from now on her name is Sarah. 
01Gn 17:16 I will bless her, and I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will become the mother of nations, and there will be kings among her descendants." 
01Gn 17:17 Abraham bowed down with his face touching the ground, but he began to laugh when he thought, "Can a man have a child when he is a hundred years old? Can Sarah have a child at ninety?" 
01Gn 17:18 He asked God, "Why not let Ishmael be my heir?" 
01Gn 17:19 But God said, "No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son and you will name him Isaac. I will keep my covenant with him and with his descendants forever. It is an everlasting covenant. 
01Gn 17:20 I have heard your request about Ishmael, so I will bless him and give him many children and many descendants. He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make a great nation of his descendants. 
01Gn 17:21 But I will keep my covenant with your son Isaac, who will be born to Sarah about this time next year." 
01Gn 17:22 When God finished speaking to Abraham, he left him. 
01Gn 17:23 On that same day Abraham obeyed God and circumcised his son Ishmael and all the other males in his household, including the slaves born in his home and those he had bought. 
01Gn 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, 
01Gn 17:25 and his son Ishmael was thirteen. 
01Gn 17:26 They were both circumcised on the same day, 
01Gn 17:27 together with all of Abraham's slaves. 
01Gn 18:1 The LORD appeared to Abraham at the sacred trees of Mamre. As Abraham was sitting at the entrance of his tent during the hottest part of the day, 
01Gn 18:2 he looked up and saw three men standing there. As soon as he saw them, he ran out to meet them. Bowing down with his face touching the ground, 
01Gn 18:3 he said, "Sirs, please do not pass by my home without stopping; I am here to serve you. 
01Gn 18:4 Let me bring some water for you to wash your feet; you can rest here beneath this tree. 
01Gn 18:5 I will also bring a bit of food; it will give you strength to continue your journey. You have honored me by coming to my home, so let me serve you." They replied, "Thank you; we accept." 
01Gn 18:6 Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, "Quick, take a sack of your best flour, and bake some bread." 
01Gn 18:7 Then he ran to the herd and picked out a calf that was tender and fat, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to get it ready. 
01Gn 18:8 He took some cream, some milk, and the meat, and set the food before the men. There under the tree he served them himself, and they ate. 
01Gn 18:9 Then they asked him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" "She is there in the tent," he answered. 
01Gn 18:10 One of them said, "Nine months from now I will come back, and your wife Sarah will have a son." Sarah was behind him, at the door of the tent, listening. 
01Gn 18:11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah had stopped having her monthly periods. 
01Gn 18:12 So Sarah laughed to herself and said, "Now that I am old and worn out, can I still enjoy sex? And besides, my husband is old too." 
01Gn 18:13 Then the LORD asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Can I really have a child when I am so old?' 
01Gn 18:14 Is anything too hard for the LORD? As I said, nine months from now I will return, and Sarah will have a son." 
01Gn 18:15 Because Sarah was afraid, she denied it. "I didn't laugh," she said. "Yes, you did," he replied. "You laughed." 
01Gn 18:16 Then the men left and went to a place where they could look down at Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on their way. 
01Gn 18:17 And the LORD said to himself, "I will not hide from Abraham what I am going to do. 
01Gn 18:18 His descendants will become a great and mighty nation, and through him I will bless all the nations. 
01Gn 18:19 I have chosen him in order that he may command his sons and his descendants to obey me and to do what is right and just. If they do, I will do everything for him that I have promised." 
01Gn 18:20 Then the LORD said to Abraham, "There are terrible accusations against Sodom and Gomorrah, and their sin is very great. 
01Gn 18:21 I must go down to find out whether or not the accusations which I have heard are true." 
01Gn 18:22 Then the two men left and went on toward Sodom, but the LORD remained with Abraham. 
01Gn 18:23 Abraham approached the LORD and asked, "Are you really going to destroy the innocent with the guilty? 
01Gn 18:24 If there are fifty innocent people in the city, will you destroy the whole city? Won't you spare it in order to save the fifty? 
01Gn 18:25 Surely you won't kill the innocent with the guilty. That's impossible! You can't do that. If you did, the innocent would be punished along with the guilty. That is impossible. The judge of all the earth has to act justly." 
01Gn 18:26 The LORD answered, "If I find fifty innocent people in Sodom, I will spare the whole city for their sake." 
01Gn 18:27 Abraham spoke again£º "Please forgive my boldness in continuing to speak to you, Lord. I am only a man and have no right to say anything. 
01Gn 18:28 But perhaps there will be only forty-five innocent people instead of fifty. Will you destroy the whole city because there are five too few?" The LORD answered, "I will not destroy the city if I find forty-five innocent people." 
01Gn 18:29 Abraham spoke again£º "Perhaps there will be only forty." He replied, "I will not destroy it if there are forty." 
01Gn 18:30 Abraham said, "Please don't be angry, Lord, but I must speak again. What if there are only thirty?" He said, "I will not do it if I find thirty." 
01Gn 18:31 Abraham said, "Please forgive my boldness in continuing to speak to you, Lord. Suppose that only twenty are found?" He said, "I will not destroy the city if I find twenty." 
01Gn 18:32 Abraham said, "Please don't be angry, Lord, and I will speak only once more. What if only ten are found?" He said, "I will not destroy it if there are ten." 
01Gn 18:33 After he had finished speaking with Abraham, the LORD went away, and Abraham returned home. 
01Gn 19:1 When the two angels came to Sodom that evening, Lot was sitting at the city gate. As soon as he saw them, he got up and went to meet them. He bowed down before them 
01Gn 19:2 and said, "Sirs, I am here to serve you. Please come to my house. You can wash your feet and spend the night. In the morning you can get up early and go on your way." But they answered, "No, we will spend the night here in the city square." 
01Gn 19:3 He kept on urging them, and finally they went with him to his house. Lot ordered his servants to bake some bread and prepare a fine meal for the guests. When it was ready, they ate it. 
01Gn 19:4 Before the guests went to bed, the men of Sodom surrounded the house. All the men of the city, both young and old, were there. 
01Gn 19:5 They called out to Lot and asked, "Where are the men who came to stay with you tonight? Bring them out to us!" The men of Sodom wanted to have sex with them. 
01Gn 19:6 Lot went outside and closed the door behind him. 
01Gn 19:7 He said to them, "Friends, I beg you, don't do such a wicked thing! 
01Gn 19:8 Look, I have two daughters who are still virgins. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do whatever you want with them. But don't do anything to these men; they are guests in my house, and I must protect them." 
01Gn 19:9 But they said, "Get out of our way, you foreigner! Who are you to tell us what to do? Out of our way, or we will treat you worse than them." They pushed Lot back and moved up to break down the door. 
01Gn 19:10 But the two men inside reached out, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door. 
01Gn 19:11 Then they struck all the men outside with blindness, so that they couldn't find the door. 
01Gn 19:12 The two men said to Lot, "If you have anyone else here - sons, daughters, sons-in-law, or any other relatives living in the city - get them out of here, 
01Gn 19:13 because we are going to destroy this place. The LORD has heard the terrible accusations against these people and has sent us to destroy Sodom." 
01Gn 19:14 Then Lot went to the men that his daughters were going to marry, and said, "Hurry up and get out of here; the LORD is going to destroy this place." But they thought he was joking. 
01Gn 19:15 At dawn the angels tried to make Lot hurry. "Quick!" they said. "Take your wife and your two daughters and get out, so that you will not lose your lives when the city is destroyed." 
01Gn 19:16 Lot hesitated. The LORD, however, had pity on him; so the men took him, his wife, and his two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city. 
01Gn 19:17 Then one of the angels said, "Run for your lives! Don't look back and don't stop in the valley. Run to the hills, so that you won't be killed." 
01Gn 19:18 But Lot answered, "No, please don't make us do that, sir. 
01Gn 19:19 You have done me a great favor and saved my life. But the hills are too far away; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die before I get there. 
01Gn 19:20 Do you see that little town? It is near enough. Let me go over there - you can see it is just a small place - and I will be safe." 
01Gn 19:21 He answered, "All right, I agree. I won't destroy that town. 
01Gn 19:22 Hurry! Run! I can't do anything until you get there." Because Lot called it small, the town was named Zoar. 
01Gn 19:23 The sun was rising when Lot reached Zoar. 
01Gn 19:24 Suddenly the LORD rained burning sulfur on the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah 
01Gn 19:25 and destroyed them and the whole valley, along with all the people there and everything that grew on the land. 
01Gn 19:26 But Lot's wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt. 
01Gn 19:27 Early the next morning Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood in the presence of the LORD. 
01Gn 19:28 He looked down at Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole valley and saw smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a huge furnace. 
01Gn 19:29 But when God destroyed the cities of the valley where Lot was living, he kept Abraham in mind and allowed Lot to escape to safety. 
01Gn 19:30 Because Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, he and his two daughters moved up into the hills and lived in a cave. 
01Gn 19:31 The older daughter said to her sister, "Our father is getting old, and there are no men in the whole world to marry us so that we can have children. 
01Gn 19:32 Come on, let's get our father drunk, so that we can sleep with him and have children by him." 
01Gn 19:33 That night they gave him wine to drink, and the older daughter had intercourse with him. But he was so drunk that he didn't know it. 
01Gn 19:34 The next day the older daughter said to her sister, "I slept with him last night; now let's get him drunk again tonight, and you sleep with him. Then each of us will have a child by our father." 
01Gn 19:35 So that night they got him drunk, and the younger daughter had intercourse with him. Again he was so drunk that he didn't know it. 
01Gn 19:36 In this way both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their own father. 
01Gn 19:37 The older daughter had a son, whom she named Moab. He was the ancestor of the present-day Moabites. 
01Gn 19:38 The younger daughter also had a son, whom she named Benammi. He was the ancestor of the present-day Ammonites. 
01Gn 20:1 Abraham moved from Mamre to the southern part of Canaan and lived between Kadesh and Shur. Later, while he was living in Gerar, 
01Gn 20:2 he said that his wife Sarah was his sister. So King Abimelech of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. 
01Gn 20:3 One night God appeared to him in a dream and said, "You are going to die, because you have taken this woman; she is already married." 
01Gn 20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her, and he said, "Lord, I am innocent! Would you destroy me and my people? 
01Gn 20:5 Abraham himself said that she was his sister, and she said the same thing. I did this with a clear conscience, and I have done no wrong." 
01Gn 20:6 God replied in the dream, "Yes, I know that you did it with a clear conscience; so I kept you from sinning against me and did not let you touch her. 
01Gn 20:7 But now, give the woman back to her husband. He is a prophet, and he will pray for you, so that you will not die. But if you do not give her back, I warn you that you are going to die, you and all your people." 
01Gn 20:8 Early the next morning Abimelech called all his officials and told them what had happened, and they were terrified. 
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, "What have you done to us? What wrong have I done to you to make you bring this disaster on me and my kingdom? No one should ever do what you have done to me. 
01Gn 20:10 Why did you do it?" 
01Gn 20:11 Abraham answered, "I thought that there would be no one here who has reverence for God and that they would kill me to get my wife. 
01Gn 20:12 She really is my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not of my mother, and I married her. 
01Gn 20:13 So when God sent me from my father's house into foreign lands, I said to her, 'You can show how loyal you are to me by telling everyone that I am your brother.' " 
01Gn 20:14 Then Abimelech gave Sarah back to Abraham, and at the same time he gave him sheep, cattle, and slaves. 
01Gn 20:15 He said to Abraham, "Here is my whole land; live anywhere you like." 
01Gn 20:16 He said to Sarah, "I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver as proof to all who are with you that you are innocent; everyone will know that you have done no wrong." 
01Gn 20:17 Because of what had happened to Sarah, Abraham's wife, the LORD had made it impossible for any woman in Abimelech's palace to have children.
01Gn 20:18 So Abraham prayed for Abimelech, and God healed him. He also healed his wife and his slave women, so that they could have children. 
01Gn 21:1 The LORD blessed Sarah, as he had promised, 
01Gn 21:2 and she became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham when he was old. The boy was born at the time God had said he would be born. 
01Gn 21:3 Abraham named him Isaac, 
01Gn 21:4 and when Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded. 
01Gn 21:5 Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born. 
01Gn 21:6 Sarah said, "God has brought me joy and laughter. Everyone who hears about it will laugh with me." 
01Gn 21:7 Then she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age." 
01Gn 21:8 The child grew, and on the day that he was weaned, Abraham gave a great feast. 
01Gn 21:9 One day Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham, was playing with Sarah's son Isaac. 
01Gn 21:10 Sarah saw them and said to Abraham, "Send this slave and her son away. The son of this woman must not get any part of your wealth, which my son Isaac should inherit." 
01Gn 21:11 This troubled Abraham very much, because Ishmael also was his son. 
01Gn 21:12 But God said to Abraham, "Don't be worried about the boy and your slave Hagar. Do whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I have promised. 
01Gn 21:13 I will also give many children to the son of the slave woman, so that they will become a nation. He too is your son." 
01Gn 21:14 Early the next morning Abraham gave Hagar some food and a leather bag full of water. He put the child on her back and sent her away. She left and wandered about in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
01Gn 21:15 When the water was all gone, she left the child under a bush 
01Gn 21:16 and sat down about a hundred yards away. She said to herself, "I can't bear to see my child die." While she was sitting there, she began to cry. 
01Gn 21:17 God heard the boy crying, and from heaven the angel of God spoke to Hagar, "What are you troubled about, Hagar? Don't be afraid. God has heard the boy crying. 
01Gn 21:18 Get up, go and pick him up, and comfort him. I will make a great nation out of his descendants." 
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well. She went and filled the leather bag with water and gave some to the boy. 
01Gn 21:20 God was with the boy as he grew up; he lived in the wilderness of Paran and became a skillful hunter. 
01Gn 21:21 His mother got an Egyptian wife for him. 
01Gn 21:22 At that time Abimelech went with Phicol, the commander of his army, and said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do. 
01Gn 21:23 So make a vow here in the presence of God that you will not deceive me, my children, or my descendants. I have been loyal to you, so promise that you will also be loyal to me and to this country in which you are living." 
01Gn 21:24 Abraham said, "I promise." 
01Gn 21:25 Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well which the servants of Abimelech had seized. 
01Gn 21:26 Abimelech said, "I don't know who did this. You didn't tell me about it, and this is the first I have heard of it." 
01Gn 21:27 Then Abraham gave some sheep and cattle to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement. 
01Gn 21:28 Abraham separated seven lambs from his flock, 
01Gn 21:29 and Abimelech asked him, "Why did you do that?" 
01Gn 21:30 Abraham answered, "Accept these seven lambs. By doing this, you admit that I am the one who dug this well." 
01Gn 21:31 And so the place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them made a vow. 
01Gn 21:32 After they had made this agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol went back to Philistia. 
01Gn 21:33 Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and worshiped the LORD, the Everlasting God. 
01Gn 21:34 Abraham lived in Philistia for a long time. 
01Gn 22:1 Some time later God tested Abraham; he called to him, "Abraham!" And Abraham answered, "Yes, here I am!" 
01Gn 22:2 "Take your son," God said, "your only son, Isaac, whom you love so much, and go to the land of Moriah. There on a mountain that I will show you, offer him as a sacrifice to me." 
01Gn 22:3 Early the next morning Abraham cut some wood for the sacrifice, loaded his donkey, and took Isaac and two servants with him. They started out for the place that God had told him about. 
01Gn 22:4 On the third day Abraham saw the place in the distance. 
01Gn 22:5 Then he said to the servants, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you." 
01Gn 22:6 Abraham made Isaac carry the wood for the sacrifice, and he himself carried a knife and live coals for starting the fire. As they walked along together, 
01Gn 22:7 Isaac spoke up, "Father!" He answered, "Yes, my son?" Isaac asked, "I see that you have the coals and the wood, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice?" 
01Gn 22:8 Abraham answered, "God himself will provide one." And the two of them walked on together. 
01Gn 22:9 When they came to the place which God had told him about, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He tied up his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. 
01Gn 22:10 Then he picked up the knife to kill him. 
01Gn 22:11 But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, "Abraham, Abraham!" He answered, "Yes, here I am." 
01Gn 22:12 "Don't hurt the boy or do anything to him," he said. "Now I know that you honor and obey God, because you have not kept back your only son from him." 
01Gn 22:13 Abraham looked around and saw a ram caught in a bush by its horns. He went and got it and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son. 
01Gn 22:14 Abraham named that place "The LORD Provides." And even today people say, "On the LORD's mountain he provides." 
01Gn 22:15 The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time, 
01Gn 22:16 "I make a vow by my own name - the LORD is speaking - that I will richly bless you. Because you did this and did not keep back your only son from me, 
01Gn 22:17 I promise that I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore. Your descendants will conquer their enemies. 
01Gn 22:18 All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants - all because you obeyed my command." 
01Gn 22:19 Abraham went back to his servants, and they went together to Beersheba, where Abraham settled. 
01Gn 22:20 Some time later Abraham learned that Milcah had borne eight children to his brother Nahor£º 
01Gn 22:21 Uz the first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
01Gn 22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel, 
01Gn 22:23 Rebecca's father. Milcah bore these eight sons to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
01Gn 22:24 Reumah, Nahor's concubine, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. 
01Gn 23:1 Sarah lived to be 127 years old. 
01Gn 23:2 She died in Hebron in the land of Canaan, and Abraham mourned her death. 
01Gn 23:3 He left the place where his wife's body was lying, went to the Hittites, and said, 
01Gn 23:4 "I am a foreigner living here among you; sell me some land, so that I can bury my wife." 
01Gn 23:5 They answered, 
01Gn 23:6 "Listen to us, sir. We look upon you as a mighty leader; bury your wife in the best grave that we have. Any of us would be glad to give you a grave, so that you can bury her." 
01Gn 23:7 Then Abraham bowed before them 
01Gn 23:8 and said, "If you are willing to let me bury my wife here, please ask Ephron son of Zohar 
01Gn 23:9 to sell me Machpelah Cave, which is near the edge of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for its full price, here in your presence, so that I can own it as a burial ground." 
01Gn 23:10 Ephron himself was sitting with the other Hittites at the meeting place at the city gate; he answered in the hearing of everyone there, 
01Gn 23:11 "Listen, sir; I will give you the whole field and the cave that is in it. Here in the presence of my own people, I will give it to you, so that you can bury your wife." 
01Gn 23:12 But Abraham bowed before the Hittites 
01Gn 23:13 and said to Ephron, so that everyone could hear, "May I ask you, please, to listen. I will buy the whole field. Accept my payment, and I will bury my wife there." 
01Gn 23:14 Ephron answered, 
01Gn 23:15 "Sir, land worth only four hundred pieces of silver - what is that between us? Bury your wife in it." 
01Gn 23:16 Abraham agreed and weighed out the amount that Ephron had mentioned in the hearing of the people - four hundred pieces of silver, according to the standard weights used by the merchants. 
01Gn 23:17 That is how the property which had belonged to Ephron at Machpelah east of Mamre, became Abraham's. It included the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees in the field up to the edge of the property. 
01Gn 23:18 It was recognized as Abraham's property by all the Hittites who were there at the meeting. 
01Gn 23:19 Then Abraham buried his wife Sarah in that cave in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 23:20 So the field which had belonged to the Hittites, and the cave in it, became the property of Abraham for a burial ground. 
01Gn 24:1 Abraham was now very old, and the LORD had blessed him in everything he did. 
01Gn 24:2 He said to his oldest servant, who was in charge of all that he had, "Place your hand between my thighs and make a vow. 
01Gn 24:3 I want you to make a vow in the name of the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son from the people here in Canaan. 
01Gn 24:4 You must go back to the country where I was born and get a wife for my son Isaac from among my relatives." 
01Gn 24:5 But the servant asked, "What if the young woman will not leave home to come with me to this land? Shall I send your son back to the land you came from?" 
01Gn 24:6 Abraham answered, "Make sure that you don't send my son back there! 
01Gn 24:7 The LORD, the God of heaven, brought me from the home of my father and from the land of my relatives, and he solemnly promised me that he would give this land to my descendants. He will send his angel before you, so that you can get a wife there for my son. 
01Gn 24:8 If the young woman is not willing to come with you, you will be free from this promise. But you must not under any circumstances take my son back there." 
01Gn 24:9 So the servant put his hand between the thighs of Abraham, his master, and made a vow to do what Abraham had asked. 
01Gn 24:10 The servant, who was in charge of Abraham's property, took ten of his master's camels and went to the city where Nahor had lived in northern Mesopotamia. 
01Gn 24:11 When he arrived, he made the camels kneel down at the well outside the city. It was late afternoon, the time when women came out to get water. 
01Gn 24:12 He prayed, " LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today and keep your promise to my master. 
01Gn 24:13 Here I am at the well where the young women of the city will be coming to get water. 
01Gn 24:14 I will say to one of them, 'Please, lower your jar and let me have a drink.' If she says, 'Drink, and I will also bring water for your camels,' may she be the one that you have chosen for your servant Isaac. If this happens, I will know that you have kept your promise to my master." 
01Gn 24:15 Before he had finished praying, Rebecca arrived with a water jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah. 
01Gn 24:16 She was a very beautiful young woman and still a virgin. She went down to the well, filled her jar, and came back. 
01Gn 24:17 The servant ran to meet her and said, "Please give me a drink of water from your jar." 
01Gn 24:18 She said, "Drink, sir," and quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and held it while he drank. 
01Gn 24:19 When he had finished, she said, "I will also bring water for your camels and let them have all they want." 
01Gn 24:20 She quickly emptied her jar into the animals' drinking trough and ran to the well to get more water, until she had watered all his camels. 
01Gn 24:21 The man kept watching her in silence, to see if the LORD had given him success. 
01Gn 24:22 When she had finished, the man took an expensive gold ring and put it in her nose and put two large gold bracelets on her arms. 
01Gn 24:23 He said, "Please tell me who your father is. Is there room in his house for my men and me to spend the night?" 
01Gn 24:24 "My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah," she answered. 
01Gn 24:25 "There is plenty of straw and fodder at our house, and there is a place for you to stay." 
01Gn 24:26 Then the man knelt down and worshiped the LORD. 
01Gn 24:27 He said, "Praise the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has faithfully kept his promise to my master. The LORD has led me straight to my master's relatives." 
01Gn 24:28 The young woman ran to her mother's house and told the whole story. 
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebecca had a brother named Laban, and he ran outside to go to the well where Abraham's servant was. 
01Gn 24:30 Laban had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms and had heard her say what the man had told her. He went to Abraham's servant, who was standing by his camels at the well, 
01Gn 24:31 and said, "Come home with me. You are a man whom the LORD has blessed. Why are you standing out here? I have a room ready for you in my house, and there is a place for your camels." 
01Gn 24:32 So the man went into the house, and Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder. Then he brought water for Abraham's servant and his men to wash their feet. 
01Gn 24:33 When food was brought, the man said, "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." Laban said, "Go on and speak." 
01Gn 24:34 "I am the servant of Abraham," he began. 
01Gn 24:35 "The LORD has greatly blessed my master and made him a rich man. He has given him flocks of sheep and goats, cattle, silver, gold, male and female slaves, camels, and donkeys. 
01Gn 24:36 Sarah, my master's wife, bore him a son when she was old, and my master has given everything he owns to him. 
01Gn 24:37 My master made me promise with a vow to obey his command. He said, 'Do not choose a wife for my son from the young women in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 24:38 Instead, go to my father's people, to my relatives, and choose a wife for him.' 
01Gn 24:39 And I asked my master, 'What if she will not come with me?' 
01Gn 24:40 He answered, 'The LORD, whom I have always obeyed, will send his angel with you and give you success. You will get for my son a wife from my own people, from my father's family. 
01Gn 24:41 There is only one way for you to be free from your vow£º if you go to my relatives and they refuse you, then you will be free.' 
01Gn 24:42 "When I came to the well today, I prayed, ' LORD, God of my master Abraham, please give me success in what I am doing. 
01Gn 24:43 Here I am at the well. When a young woman comes out to get water, I will ask her to give me a drink of water from her jar. 
01Gn 24:44 If she agrees and also offers to bring water for my camels, may she be the one that you have chosen as the wife for my master's son.' 
01Gn 24:45 Before I had finished my silent prayer, Rebecca came with a water jar on her shoulder and went down to the well to get water. I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.' 
01Gn 24:46 She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will also water your camels.' So I drank, and she watered the camels. 
01Gn 24:47 I asked her, 'Who is your father?' And she answered, 'My father is Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.' Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 
01Gn 24:48 I knelt down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me straight to my master's relative, where I found his daughter for my master's son. 
01Gn 24:49 Now, if you intend to fulfill your responsibility toward my master and treat him fairly, please tell me; if not, say so, and I will decide what to do." 
01Gn 24:50 Laban and Bethuel answered, "Since this matter comes from the LORD, it is not for us to make a decision. 
01Gn 24:51 Here is Rebecca; take her and go. Let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD himself has said." 
01Gn 24:52 When the servant of Abraham heard this, he bowed down and worshiped the LORD. 
01Gn 24:53 Then he brought out clothing and silver and gold jewelry, and gave them to Rebecca. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
01Gn 24:54 Then Abraham's servant and the men with him ate and drank, and spent the night there. When they got up in the morning, he said, "Let me go back to my master." 
01Gn 24:55 But Rebecca's brother and her mother said, "Let her stay with us a week or ten days, and then she may go." 
01Gn 24:56 But he said, "Don't make us stay. The LORD has made my journey a success; let me go back to my master." 
01Gn 24:57 They answered, "Let's call her and find out what she has to say." 
01Gn 24:58 So they called Rebecca and asked, "Do you want to go with this man?" "Yes," she answered. 
01Gn 24:59 So they let Rebecca and her old family servant go with Abraham's servant and his men. 
01Gn 24:60 And they gave Rebecca their blessing in these words£º "May you, sister, become the mother of millions! May your descendants conquer the cities of their enemies!" 
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebecca and her young women got ready and mounted the camels to go with Abraham's servant, and they all started out. 
01Gn 24:62 Isaac had come into the wilderness of "The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me" and was staying in the southern part of Canaan. 
01Gn 24:63 He went out in the early evening to take a walk in the fields and saw camels coming. 
01Gn 24:64 When Rebecca saw Isaac, she got down from her camel 
01Gn 24:65 and asked Abraham's servant, "Who is that man walking toward us in the field?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her scarf and covered her face. 
01Gn 24:66 The servant told Isaac everything he had done. 
01Gn 24:67 Then Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent that his mother Sarah had lived in, and she became his wife. Isaac loved Rebecca, and so he was comforted for the loss of his mother. 
01Gn 25:1 Abraham married another woman, whose name was Keturah. 
01Gn 25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
01Gn 25:3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan, and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim. 
01Gn 25:4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were Keturah's descendants. 
01Gn 25:5 Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac; 
01Gn 25:6 but while he was still alive, he gave presents to the sons his other wives had borne him. Then he sent these sons to the land of the East, away from his son Isaac. 
01Gn 25:7 Abraham died 
01Gn 25:8 at the ripe old age of 175.
01Gn 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in Machpelah Cave, in the field east of Mamre that had belonged to Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite. 
01Gn 25:10 It was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites; both Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there. 
01Gn 25:11 After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near "The Well of the Living One Who Sees Me." 
01Gn 25:12 Ishmael, whom Hagar, the Egyptian slave of Sarah, bore to Abraham, 
01Gn 25:13 had the following sons, listed in the order of their birth£º Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
01Gn 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
01Gn 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
01Gn 25:16 They were the ancestors of twelve tribes, and their names were given to their villages and camping places. 
01Gn 25:17 Ishmael was 137 years old when he died. 
01Gn 25:18 The descendants of Ishmael lived in the territory between Havilah and Shur, to the east of Egypt on the way to Assyria. They lived apart from the other descendants of Abraham. 
01Gn 25:19 This is the story of Abraham's son Isaac. 
01Gn 25:20 Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel (an Aramean from Mesopotamia) and sister of Laban. 
01Gn 25:21 Because Rebecca had no children, Isaac prayed to the LORD for her. The LORD answered his prayer, and Rebecca became pregnant. 
01Gn 25:22 She was going to have twins, and before they were born, they struggled against each other in her womb. She said, "Why should something like this happen to me?" So she went to ask the LORD for an answer. 
01Gn 25:23 The LORD said to her, "Two nations are within you; You will give birth to two rival peoples. One will be stronger than the other; The older will serve the younger." 
01Gn 25:24 The time came for her to give birth, and she had twin sons. 
01Gn 25:25 The first one was reddish, and his skin was like a hairy robe, so he was named Esau. 
01Gn 25:26 The second one was born holding on tightly to the heel of Esau, so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. 
01Gn 25:27 The boys grew up, and Esau became a skilled hunter, a man who loved the outdoors, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home. 
01Gn 25:28 Isaac preferred Esau, because he enjoyed eating the animals Esau killed, but Rebecca preferred Jacob. 
01Gn 25:29 One day while Jacob was cooking some bean soup, Esau came in from hunting. He was hungry 
01Gn 25:30 and said to Jacob, "I'm starving; give me some of that red stuff." (That is why he was named Edom. ) 
01Gn 25:31 Jacob answered, "I will give it to you if you give me your rights as the first-born son." 
01Gn 25:32 Esau said, "All right! I am about to die; what good will my rights do me?" 
01Gn 25:33 Jacob answered, "First make a vow that you will give me your rights." Esau made the vow and gave his rights to Jacob. 
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave him some bread and some of the soup. He ate and drank and then got up and left. That was all Esau cared about his rights as the first-born son. 
01Gn 26:1 There was another famine in the land besides the earlier one during the time of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar. 
01Gn 26:2 The LORD had appeared to Isaac and had said, "Do not go to Egypt; stay in this land, where I tell you to stay. 
01Gn 26:3 Live here, and I will be with you and bless you. I am going to give all this territory to you and to your descendants. I will keep the promise I made to your father Abraham. 
01Gn 26:4 I will give you as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, and I will give them all this territory. All the nations will ask me to bless them as I have blessed your descendants. 
01Gn 26:5 I will bless you, because Abraham obeyed me and kept all my laws and commands." 
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac lived at Gerar. 
01Gn 26:7 When the men there asked about his wife, he said that she was his sister. He would not admit that she was his wife, because he was afraid that the men there would kill him to get Rebecca, who was very beautiful. 
01Gn 26:8 When Isaac had been there for some time, King Abimelech looked down from his window and saw Isaac and Rebecca making love. 
01Gn 26:9 Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, "So she is your wife! Why did you say she was your sister?" He answered, "I thought I would be killed if I said she was my wife." 
01Gn 26:10 "What have you done to us?" Abimelech said. "One of my men might easily have slept with your wife, and you would have been responsible for our guilt." 
01Gn 26:11 Abimelech warned all the people£º "Anyone who mistreats this man or his wife will be put to death." 
01Gn 26:12 Isaac sowed crops in that land, and that year he harvested a hundred times as much as he had sown, because the LORD blessed him. 
01Gn 26:13 He continued to prosper and became a very rich man. 
01Gn 26:14 Because he had many herds of sheep and cattle and many servants, the Philistines were jealous of him. 
01Gn 26:15 So they filled in all the wells which the servants of his father Abraham had dug while Abraham was alive. 
01Gn 26:16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave our country. You have become more powerful than we are." 
01Gn 26:17 So Isaac left and set up his camp in Gerar Valley, where he stayed for some time. 
01Gn 26:18 He dug once again the wells which had been dug during the time of Abraham and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death. Isaac gave the wells the same names that his father had given them. 
01Gn 26:19 Isaac's servants dug a well in the valley and found water. 
01Gn 26:20 The shepherds of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's shepherds and said, "This water belongs to us." So Isaac named the well "Quarrel." 
01Gn 26:21 Isaac's servants dug another well, and there was a quarrel about that one also, so he named it "Enmity." 
01Gn 26:22 He moved away from there and dug another well. There was no dispute about this one, so he named it "Freedom." He said, "Now the LORD has given us freedom to live in the land, and we will be prosperous here." 
01Gn 26:23 Isaac left and went to Beersheba. 
01Gn 26:24 That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid; I am with you. I will bless you and give you many descendants because of my promise to my servant Abraham." 
01Gn 26:25 Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the LORD. Then he set up his camp there, and his servants dug another well. 
01Gn 26:26 Abimelech came from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army to see Isaac. 
01Gn 26:27 So Isaac asked, "Why have you now come to see me, when you were so unfriendly to me before and made me leave your country?" 
01Gn 26:28 They answered, "Now we know that the LORD is with you, and we think that there should be a solemn agreement between us. We want you to promise 
01Gn 26:29 that you will not harm us, just as we did not harm you. We were kind to you and let you go peacefully. Now it is clear that the LORD has blessed you." 
01Gn 26:30 Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank. 
01Gn 26:31 Early next morning each man made his promise and sealed it with a vow. Isaac said good-bye to them, and they parted as friends. 
01Gn 26:32 On that day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug. They said, "We have found water." 
01Gn 26:33 He named the well "Vow." That is how the city of Beersheba got its name. 
01Gn 26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he married two Hittites, Judith the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath the daughter of Elon. 
01Gn 26:35 They made life miserable for Isaac and Rebecca. 
01Gn 27:1 Isaac was now old and had become blind. He sent for his older son Esau and said to him, "Son!" "Yes," he answered. 
01Gn 27:2 Isaac said, "You see that I am old and may die soon. 
01Gn 27:3 Take your bow and arrows, go out into the country, and kill an animal for me. 
01Gn 27:4 Cook me some of that tasty food that I like, and bring it to me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my final blessing before I die." 
01Gn 27:5 While Isaac was talking to Esau, Rebecca was listening. So when Esau went out to hunt, 
01Gn 27:6 she said to Jacob, "I have just heard your father say to Esau, 
01Gn 27:7 'Bring me an animal and cook it for me. After I have eaten it, I will give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.' 
01Gn 27:8 Now, son," Rebecca continued, "listen to me and do what I say. 
01Gn 27:9 Go to the flock and pick out two fat young goats, so that I can cook them and make some of that food your father likes so much. 
01Gn 27:10 You can take it to him to eat, and he will give you his blessing before he dies." 
01Gn 27:11 But Jacob said to his mother, "You know that Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin. 
01Gn 27:12 Perhaps my father will touch me and find out that I am deceiving him; in this way, I will bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing." 
01Gn 27:13 His mother answered, "Let any curse against you fall on me, my son; just do as I say, and go and get the goats for me." 
01Gn 27:14 So he went to get them and brought them to her, and she cooked the kind of food that his father liked. 
01Gn 27:15 Then she took Esau's best clothes, which she kept in the house, and put them on Jacob. 
01Gn 27:16 She put the skins of the goats on his arms and on the hairless part of his neck. 
01Gn 27:17 She handed him the tasty food, along with the bread she had baked. 
01Gn 27:18 Then Jacob went to his father and said, "Father!" "Yes," he answered. "Which of my sons are you?" 
01Gn 27:19 Jacob answered, "I am your older son Esau; I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing." 
01Gn 27:20 Isaac said, "How did you find it so quickly, son?" Jacob answered, "The LORD your God helped me find it." 
01Gn 27:21 Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come closer so that I can touch you. Are you really Esau?" 
01Gn 27:22 Jacob moved closer to his father, who felt him and said, "Your voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but your arms feel like Esau's arms." 
01Gn 27:23 He did not recognize Jacob, because his arms were hairy like Esau's. He was about to give him his blessing, 
01Gn 27:24 but asked again, "Are you really Esau?" "I am," he answered. 
01Gn 27:25 Isaac said, "Bring me some of the meat. After I eat it, I will give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him, and he also brought him some wine to drink. 
01Gn 27:26 Then his father said to him, "Come closer and kiss me, son." 
01Gn 27:27 As he came up to kiss him, Isaac smelled his clothes - so he gave him his blessing. He said, "The pleasant smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed. 
01Gn 27:28 May God give you dew from heaven and make your fields fertile! May he give you plenty of grain and wine! 
01Gn 27:29 May nations be your servants, and may peoples bow down before you. May you rule over all your relatives, and may your mother's descendants bow down before you. May those who curse you be cursed, and may those who bless you be blessed." 
01Gn 27:30 Isaac finished giving his blessing, and as soon as Jacob left, his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
01Gn 27:31 He also cooked some tasty food and took it to his father. He said, "Please, father, sit up and eat some of the meat that I have brought you, so that you can give me your blessing." 
01Gn 27:32 "Who are you?" Isaac asked. "Your older son Esau," he answered. 
01Gn 27:33 Isaac began to tremble and shake all over, and he asked, "Who was it, then, who killed an animal and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came. I gave him my final blessing, and so it is his forever." 
01Gn 27:34 When Esau heard this, he cried out loudly and bitterly and said, "Give me your blessing also, father!" 
01Gn 27:35 Isaac answered, "Your brother came and deceived me. He has taken away your blessing." 
01Gn 27:36 Esau said, "This is the second time that he has cheated me. No wonder his name is Jacob. He took my rights as the first-born son, and now he has taken away my blessing. Haven't you saved a blessing for me?" 
01Gn 27:37 Isaac answered, "I have already made him master over you, and I have made all his relatives his slaves. I have given him grain and wine. Now there is nothing that I can do for you, son!" 
01Gn 27:38 Esau continued to plead with his father£º "Do you have only one blessing, father? Bless me too, father!" He began to cry. 
01Gn 27:39 Then Isaac said to him, "No dew from heaven for you, No fertile fields for you. 
01Gn 27:40 You will live by your sword, But be your brother's slave. Yet when you rebel, You will break away from his control." 
01Gn 27:41 Esau hated Jacob, because his father had given Jacob the blessing. He thought, "The time to mourn my father's death is near; then I will kill Jacob." 
01Gn 27:42 But when Rebecca heard about Esau's plan, she sent for Jacob and said, "Listen, your brother Esau is planning to get even with you and kill you. 
01Gn 27:43 Now, son, do what I say. Go at once to my brother Laban in Haran, 
01Gn 27:44 and stay with him for a while, until your brother's anger cools down 
01Gn 27:45 and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send someone to bring you back. Why should I lose both of my sons on the same day?" 
01Gn 27:46 Rebecca said to Isaac, "I am sick and tired of Esau's foreign wives. If Jacob also marries one of these Hittites, I might as well die." 
01Gn 28:1 Isaac called Jacob, greeted him, and told him, "Don't marry a Canaanite. 
01Gn 28:2 Go instead to Mesopotamia, to the home of your grandfather Bethuel, and marry one of the young women there, one of your uncle Laban's daughters. 
01Gn 28:3 May Almighty God bless your marriage and give you many children, so that you will become the father of many nations! 
01Gn 28:4 May he bless you and your descendants as he blessed Abraham, and may you take possession of this land, in which you have lived and which God gave to Abraham!" 
01Gn 28:5 Isaac sent Jacob away to Mesopotamia, to Laban, who was the son of Bethuel the Aramean and the brother of Rebecca, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 
01Gn 28:6 Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Mesopotamia to find a wife. He also learned that when Isaac blessed him, he commanded him not to marry a Canaanite woman. 
01Gn 28:7 He found out that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Mesopotamia. 
01Gn 28:8 Esau then understood that his father Isaac did not approve of Canaanite women. 
01Gn 28:9 So he went to Ishmael son of Abraham and married his daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth. 
01Gn 28:10 Jacob left Beersheba and started toward Haran. 
01Gn 28:11 At sunset he came to a holy place and camped there. He lay down to sleep, resting his head on a stone. 
01Gn 28:12 He dreamed that he saw a stairway reaching from earth to heaven, with angels going up and coming down on it. 
01Gn 28:13 And there was the LORD standing beside him. "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham and Isaac," he said. "I will give to you and to your descendants this land on which you are lying. 
01Gn 28:14 They will be as numerous as the specks of dust on the earth. They will extend their territory in all directions, and through you and your descendants I will bless all the nations. 
01Gn 28:15 Remember, I will be with you and protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done all that I have promised you." 
01Gn 28:16 Jacob woke up and said, "The LORD is here! He is in this place, and I didn't know it!" 
01Gn 28:17 He was afraid and said, "What a terrifying place this is! It must be the house of God; it must be the gate that opens into heaven." 
01Gn 28:18 Jacob got up early next morning, took the stone that was under his head, and set it up as a memorial. Then he poured olive oil on it to dedicate it to God. 
01Gn 28:19 He named the place Bethel. (The town there was once known as Luz.) 
01Gn 28:20 Then Jacob made a vow to the LORD£º "If you will be with me and protect me on the journey I am making and give me food and clothing, 
01Gn 28:21 and if I return safely to my father's home, then you will be my God. 
01Gn 28:22 This memorial stone which I have set up will be the place where you are worshiped, and I will give you a tenth of everything you give me." 
01Gn 29:1 Jacob continued on his way and went toward the land of the East. 
01Gn 29:2 Suddenly he came upon a well out in the fields with three flocks of sheep lying around it. The flocks were watered from this well, which had a large stone over the opening. 
01Gn 29:3 Whenever all the flocks came together there, the shepherds would roll the stone back and water them. Then they would put the stone back in place. 
01Gn 29:4 Jacob asked the shepherds, "My friends, where are you from?" "From Haran," they answered. 
01Gn 29:5 He asked, "Do you know Laban, grandson of Nahor?" "Yes, we do," they answered. 
01Gn 29:6 "Is he well?" he asked. "He is well," they answered. "Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with his flock." 
01Gn 29:7 Jacob said, "Since it is still broad daylight and not yet time to bring the flocks in, why don't you water them and take them back to pasture?" 
01Gn 29:8 They answered, "We can't do that until all the flocks are here and the stone has been rolled back; then we will water the flocks." 
01Gn 29:9 While Jacob was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with the flock. 
01Gn 29:10 When Jacob saw Rachel with his uncle Laban's flock, he went to the well, rolled the stone back, and watered the sheep. 
01Gn 29:11 Then he kissed her and began to cry for joy. 
01Gn 29:12 He told her, "I am your father's relative, the son of Rebecca." She ran to tell her father; 
01Gn 29:13 and when he heard the news about his nephew Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him and kissed him, and brought him into the house. When Jacob told Laban everything that had happened, 
01Gn 29:14 Laban said, "Yes, indeed, you are my own flesh and blood." Jacob stayed there a whole month. 
01Gn 29:15 Laban said to Jacob, "You shouldn't work for me for nothing just because you are my relative. How much pay do you want?" 
01Gn 29:16 Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger Rachel. 
01Gn 29:17 Leah had lovely eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. 
01Gn 29:18 Jacob was in love with Rachel, so he said, "I will work seven years for you, if you will let me marry Rachel." 
01Gn 29:19 Laban answered, "I would rather give her to you than to anyone else; stay here with me." 
01Gn 29:20 Jacob worked seven years so that he could have Rachel, and the time seemed like only a few days to him, because he loved her. 
01Gn 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "The time is up; let me marry your daughter." 
01Gn 29:22 So Laban gave a wedding feast and invited everyone. 
01Gn 29:23 But that night, instead of Rachel, he took Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had intercourse with her. 
01Gn 29:24 (Laban gave his slave woman Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.) 
01Gn 29:25 Not until the next morning did Jacob discover that it was Leah. He went to Laban and said, "Why did you do this to me? I worked to get Rachel. Why have you tricked me?" 
01Gn 29:26 Laban answered, "It is not the custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. 
01Gn 29:27 Wait until the week's marriage celebrations are over, and I will give you Rachel, if you will work for me another seven years." 
01Gn 29:28 Jacob agreed, and when the week of marriage celebrations was over, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. 
01Gn 29:29 (Laban gave his slave woman Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.) 
01Gn 29:30 Jacob had intercourse with Rachel also, and he loved her more than Leah. Then he worked for Laban another seven years. 
01Gn 29:31 When the LORD saw that Leah was loved less than Rachel, he made it possible for her to have children, but Rachel remained childless. 
01Gn 29:32 Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, "The LORD has seen my trouble, and now my husband will love me"; so she named him Reuben. 
01Gn 29:33 She became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, "The LORD has given me this son also, because he heard that I was not loved"; so she named him Simeon. 
01Gn 29:34 Once again she became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She said, "Now my husband will be bound more tightly to me, because I have borne him three sons"; so she named him Levi. 
01Gn 29:35 Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She said, "This time I will praise the LORD"; so she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children. 
01Gn 30:1 But Rachel had not borne Jacob any children, and so she became jealous of her sister and said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I will die." 
01Gn 30:2 Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, "I can't take the place of God. He is the one who keeps you from having children." 
01Gn 30:3 She said, "Here is my slave Bilhah; sleep with her, so that she can have a child for me. In this way I can become a mother through her." 
01Gn 30:4 So she gave Bilhah to her husband, and he had intercourse with her. 
01Gn 30:5 Bilhah became pregnant and bore Jacob a son. 
01Gn 30:6 Rachel said, "God has judged in my favor. He has heard my prayer and has given me a son"; so she named him Dan. 
01Gn 30:7 Bilhah became pregnant again and bore Jacob a second son. 
01Gn 30:8 Rachel said, "I have fought a hard fight with my sister, but I have won"; so she named him Naphtali. 
01Gn 30:9 When Leah realized that she had stopped having children, she gave her slave Zilpah to Jacob as his wife. 
01Gn 30:10 Then Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
01Gn 30:11 Leah said, "I have been lucky"; so she named him Gad. 
01Gn 30:12 Zilpah bore Jacob another son, 
01Gn 30:13 and Leah said, "How happy I am! Now women will call me happy"; so she named him Asher. 
01Gn 30:14 During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the fields and found mandrakes, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes." 
01Gn 30:15 Leah answered, "Isn't it enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you are even trying to take away my son's mandrakes." Rachel said, "If you will give me your son's mandrakes, you can sleep with Jacob tonight." 
01Gn 30:16 When Jacob came in from the fields in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, "You are going to sleep with me tonight, because I have paid for you with my son's mandrakes." So he had intercourse with her that night. 
01Gn 30:17 God answered Leah's prayer, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
01Gn 30:18 Leah said, "God has given me my reward, because I gave my slave to my husband"; so she named her son Issachar. 
01Gn 30:19 Leah became pregnant again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
01Gn 30:20 She said, "God has given me a fine gift. Now my husband will accept me, because I have borne him six sons"; so she named him Zebulun. 
01Gn 30:21 Later she bore a daughter, whom she named Dinah. 
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel; he answered her prayer and made it possible for her to have children. 
01Gn 30:23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, "God has taken away my disgrace by giving me a son. 
01Gn 30:24 May the LORD give me another son"; so she named him Joseph. 
01Gn 30:25 After the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Let me go, so that I can return home. 
01Gn 30:26 Give me my wives and children that I have earned by working for you, and I will leave. You know how well I have served you." 
01Gn 30:27 Laban said to him, "Let me say this£º I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you. 
01Gn 30:28 Name your wages, and I will pay them." 
01Gn 30:29 Jacob answered, "You know how I have worked for you and how your flocks have prospered under my care. 
01Gn 30:30 The little you had before I came has grown enormously, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I went. Now it is time for me to look out for my own interests." 
01Gn 30:31 "What shall I pay you?" Laban asked. Jacob answered, "I don't want any wages. I will continue to take care of your flocks if you agree to this suggestion£º 
01Gn 30:32 Let me go through all your flocks today and take every black lamb and every spotted or speckled young goat. That is all the wages I want. 
01Gn 30:33 In the future you can easily find out if I have been honest. When you come to check up on my wages, if I have any goat that isn't speckled or spotted or any sheep that isn't black, you will know that it has been stolen." 
01Gn 30:34 Laban answered, "Agreed. We will do as you suggest." 
01Gn 30:35 But that day Laban removed the male goats that had stripes or spots and all the females that were speckled and spotted or which had white on them; he also removed all the black sheep. He put his sons in charge of them, 
01Gn 30:36 and then went away from Jacob with this flock as far as he could travel in three days. Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks. 
01Gn 30:37 Jacob got green branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them. 
01Gn 30:38 He placed these branches in front of the flocks at their drinking troughs. He put them there, because the animals mated when they came to drink. 
01Gn 30:39 So when the goats bred in front of the branches, they produced young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted. 
01Gn 30:40 Jacob kept the sheep separate from the goats and made them face in the direction of the streaked and black animals of Laban's flock. In this way he built up his own flock and kept it apart from Laban's. 
01Gn 30:41 When the healthy animals were mating, Jacob put the branches in front of them at the drinking troughs, so that they would breed among the branches. 
01Gn 30:42 But he did not put the branches in front of the weak animals. Soon Laban had all the weak animals, and Jacob all the healthy ones. 
01Gn 30:43 In this way Jacob became very wealthy. He had many flocks, slaves, camels, and donkeys. 
01Gn 31:1 Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father. He got all his wealth from what our father owned." 
01Gn 31:2 He also saw that Laban was no longer as friendly as he had been earlier. 
01Gn 31:3 Then the LORD said to him, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. I will be with you." 
01Gn 31:4 So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where his flocks were. 
01Gn 31:5 He said to them, "I have noticed that your father is not as friendly toward me as he used to be; but my father's God has been with me. 
01Gn 31:6 You both know that I have worked for your father with all my strength. 
01Gn 31:7 Yet he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not let him harm me. 
01Gn 31:8 Whenever Laban said, 'The speckled goats shall be your wages,' all the flocks produced speckled young. When he said, 'The striped goats shall be your wages,' all the flocks produced striped young. 
01Gn 31:9 God has taken flocks away from your father and given them to me. 
01Gn 31:10 "During the breeding season I had a dream, and I saw that the male goats that were mating were striped, spotted, and speckled. 
01Gn 31:11 The angel of God spoke to me in the dream and said, 'Jacob!' 'Yes,' I answered. 
01Gn 31:12 'Look,' he continued, 'all the male goats that are mating are striped, spotted, and speckled. I am making this happen because I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 
01Gn 31:13 I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you dedicated a stone as a memorial by pouring olive oil on it and where you made a vow to me. Now get ready and go back to the land where you were born.' " 
01Gn 31:14 Rachel and Leah answered Jacob, "There is nothing left for us to inherit from our father. 
01Gn 31:15 He treats us like foreigners. He sold us, and now he has spent all the money he was paid for us. 
01Gn 31:16 All this wealth which God has taken from our father belongs to us and to our children. Do whatever God has told you." 
01Gn 31:17 So Jacob got ready to go back to his father in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 31:18 He put his children and his wives on the camels, and drove all his flocks ahead of him, with everything that he had gotten in Mesopotamia.
01Gn 31:19 Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and during his absence Rachel stole the household gods that belonged to her father. 
01Gn 31:20 Jacob deceived Laban by not letting him know that he was leaving. 
01Gn 31:21 He took everything he owned and left in a hurry. He crossed the Euphrates River and started for the hill country of Gilead. 
01Gn 31:22 Three days later Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
01Gn 31:23 He took his men with him and pursued Jacob for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 
01Gn 31:24 In a dream that night God came to Laban and said to him, "Be careful not to threaten Jacob in any way." 
01Gn 31:25 Jacob had set up his camp on a mountain, and Laban set up his camp with his relatives in the hill country of Gilead. 
01Gn 31:26 Laban said to Jacob, "Why did you deceive me and carry off my daughters like women captured in war? 
01Gn 31:27 Why did you deceive me and slip away without telling me? If you had told me, I would have sent you on your way with rejoicing and singing to the music of tambourines and harps. 
01Gn 31:28 You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye. That was a foolish thing to do! 
01Gn 31:29 I have the power to do you harm, but last night the God of your father warned me not to threaten you in any way. 
01Gn 31:30 I know that you left because you were so anxious to get back home, but why did you steal my household gods?" 
01Gn 31:31 Jacob answered, "I was afraid, because I thought that you might take your daughters away from me. 
01Gn 31:32 But if you find that anyone here has your gods, he will be put to death. Here, with our men as witnesses, look for anything that belongs to you and take what is yours." Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban's gods. 
01Gn 31:33 Laban went and searched Jacob's tent; then he went into Leah's tent, and the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find his gods. Then he went into Rachel's tent. 
01Gn 31:34 Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in a camel's saddlebag and was sitting on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but did not find them. 
01Gn 31:35 Rachel said to her father, "Do not be angry with me, sir, but I am not able to stand up in your presence; I am having my monthly period." Laban searched but did not find his household gods. 
01Gn 31:36 Then Jacob lost his temper. "What crime have I committed?" he asked angrily. "What law have I broken that gives you the right to hunt me down? 
01Gn 31:37 Now that you have searched through all my belongings, what household article have you found that belongs to you? Put it out here where your men and mine can see it, and let them decide which one of us is right. 
01Gn 31:38 I have been with you now for twenty years; your sheep and your goats have not failed to reproduce, and I have not eaten any rams from your flocks. 
01Gn 31:39 Whenever a sheep was killed by wild animals, I always bore the loss myself. I didn't take it to you to show that it was not my fault. You demanded that I make good anything that was stolen during the day or during the night. 
01Gn 31:40 Many times I suffered from the heat during the day and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep. 
01Gn 31:41 It was like that for the whole twenty years I was with you. For fourteen years I worked to win your two daughters - and six years for your flocks. And even then, you changed my wages ten times. 
01Gn 31:42 If the God of my fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac, had not been with me, you would have already sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my trouble and the work I have done, and last night he gave his judgment." 
01Gn 31:43 Laban answered Jacob, "These young women are my daughters; their children belong to me, and these flocks are mine. In fact, everything you see here belongs to me. But since I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children, 
01Gn 31:44 I am ready to make an agreement with you. Let us make a pile of stones to remind us of our agreement." 
01Gn 31:45 So Jacob got a stone and set it up as a memorial. 
01Gn 31:46 He told his men to gather some rocks and pile them up. Then they ate a meal beside the pile of rocks. 
01Gn 31:47 Laban named it Jegar Sahadutha, while Jacob named it Galeed. 
01Gn 31:48 Laban said to Jacob, "This pile of rocks will be a reminder for both of us." That is why that place was named Galeed. 
01Gn 31:49 Laban also said, "May the LORD keep an eye on us while we are separated from each other." So the place was also named Mizpah. 
01Gn 31:50 Laban went on, "If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other women, even though I don't know about it, remember that God is watching us. 
01Gn 31:51 Here are the rocks that I have piled up between us, and here is the memorial stone. 
01Gn 31:52 Both this pile and this memorial stone are reminders. I will never go beyond this pile to attack you, and you must never go beyond it or beyond this memorial stone to attack me. 
01Gn 31:53 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor will judge between us." Then, in the name of the God whom his father Isaac worshiped, Jacob solemnly vowed to keep this promise. 
01Gn 31:54 He killed an animal, which he offered as a sacrifice on the mountain, and he invited his men to the meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. 
01Gn 31:55 Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters good-bye, and left to go back home. 
01Gn 32:1 As Jacob went on his way, some angels met him. 
01Gn 32:2 When he saw them, he said, "This is God's camp"; so he named the place Mahanaim. 
01Gn 32:3 Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the country of Edom. 
01Gn 32:4 He instructed them to say£º "I, Jacob, your obedient servant, report to my master Esau that I have been staying with Laban and that I have delayed my return until now. 
01Gn 32:5 I own cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and slaves. I am sending you word, sir, in the hope of gaining your favor." 
01Gn 32:6 When the messengers came back to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and he is already on his way to meet you. He has four hundred men with him." 
01Gn 32:7 Jacob was frightened and worried. He divided into two groups the people who were with him, and also his sheep, goats, cattle, and camels. 
01Gn 32:8 He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks the first group, the other may be able to escape." 
01Gn 32:9 Then Jacob prayed, "God of my grandfather Abraham and God of my father Isaac, hear me! You told me, LORD, to go back to my land and to my relatives, and you would make everything go well for me. 
01Gn 32:10 I am not worth all the kindness and faithfulness that you have shown me, your servant. I crossed the Jordan with nothing but a walking stick, and now I have come back with these two groups. 
01Gn 32:11 Save me, I pray, from my brother Esau. I am afraid - afraid that he is coming to attack us and destroy us all, even the women and children. 
01Gn 32:12 Remember that you promised to make everything go well for me and to give me more descendants than anyone could count, as many as the grains of sand along the seashore." 
01Gn 32:13 After spending the night there, Jacob chose from his livestock as a present for his brother Esau£º
01Gn 32:14 200 female goats and 20 males, 200 female sheep and 20 males,
01Gn 32:15 30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 males.
01Gn 32:16 He divided them into herds and put one of his servants in charge of each herd. He said to them, "Go ahead of me, and leave a space between each herd and the one behind it." 
01Gn 32:17 He ordered the first servant, "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Who is your master? Where are you going? Who owns these animals in front of you?' 
01Gn 32:18 you must answer, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. He sends them as a present to his master Esau. Jacob himself is right behind us.' " 
01Gn 32:19 He gave the same order to the second, the third, and to all the others who were in charge of the herds£º "This is what you must say to Esau when you meet him. 
01Gn 32:20 You must say, 'Yes, your servant Jacob is right behind us.' " Jacob was thinking, "I will win him over with the gifts, and when I meet him, perhaps he will forgive me." 
01Gn 32:21 He sent the gifts on ahead of him and spent that night in camp. 
01Gn 32:22 That same night Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two concubines, and his eleven children, and crossed the Jabbok River. 
01Gn 32:23 After he had sent them across, he also sent across all that he owned, 
01Gn 32:24 but he stayed behind, alone. Then a man came and wrestled with him until just before daybreak. 
01Gn 32:25 When the man saw that he was not winning the struggle, he hit Jacob on the hip, and it was thrown out of joint. 
01Gn 32:26 The man said, "Let me go; daylight is coming." "I won't, unless you bless me," Jacob answered. 
01Gn 32:27 "What is your name?" the man asked. "Jacob," he answered. 
01Gn 32:28 The man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob. You have struggled with God and with men, and you have won; so your name will be Israel." 
01Gn 32:29 Jacob said, "Now tell me your name." But he answered, "Why do you want to know my name?" Then he blessed Jacob. 
01Gn 32:30 Jacob said, "I have seen God face-to-face, and I am still alive"; so he named the place Peniel. 
01Gn 32:31 The sun rose as Jacob was leaving Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. 
01Gn 32:32 Even today the descendants of Israel do not eat the muscle which is on the hip joint, because it was on this muscle that Jacob was hit. 
01Gn 33:1 Jacob saw Esau coming with his four hundred men, so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two concubines. 
01Gn 33:2 He put the concubines and their children first, then Leah and her children, and finally Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
01Gn 33:3 Jacob went ahead of them and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 
01Gn 33:4 But Esau ran to meet him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. They were both crying. 
01Gn 33:5 When Esau looked around and saw the women and the children, he asked, "Who are these people with you?" "These, sir, are the children whom God has been good enough to give me," Jacob answered. 
01Gn 33:6 Then the concubines came up with their children and bowed down; 
01Gn 33:7 then Leah and her children came, and last of all Joseph and Rachel came and bowed down. 
01Gn 33:8 Esau asked, "What about that other group I met? What did that mean?" Jacob answered, "It was to gain your favor." 
01Gn 33:9 But Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; keep what you have." 
01Gn 33:10 Jacob said, "No, please, if I have gained your favor, accept my gift. To see your face is for me like seeing the face of God, now that you have been so friendly to me. 
01Gn 33:11 Please accept this gift which I have brought for you; God has been kind to me and given me everything I need." Jacob kept on urging him until he accepted. 
01Gn 33:12 Esau said, "Let's get ready and leave. I will go ahead of you." 
01Gn 33:13 Jacob answered, "You know that the children are weak, and I must think of the sheep and livestock with their young. If they are driven hard for even one day, the whole herd will die. 
01Gn 33:14 Please go on ahead of me, and I will follow slowly, going as fast as I can with the livestock and the children until I catch up with you in Edom." 
01Gn 33:15 Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." But Jacob answered, "There is no need for that for I only want to gain your favor." 
01Gn 33:16 So that day Esau started on his way back to Edom. 
01Gn 33:17 But Jacob went to Sukkoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was named Sukkoth. 
01Gn 33:18 On his return from Mesopotamia Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan and set up his camp in a field near the city. 
01Gn 33:19 He bought that part of the field from the descendants of Hamor father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver. 
01Gn 33:20 He put up an altar there and named it for El, the God of Israel. 
01Gn 34:1 One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the Canaanite women. 
01Gn 34:2 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, who was chief of that region, saw her, he took her and raped her. 
01Gn 34:3 But he found the young woman so attractive that he fell in love with her and tried to win her affection. 
01Gn 34:4 He told his father, "I want you to get Dinah for me as my wife." 
01Gn 34:5 Jacob learned that his daughter had been disgraced, but because his sons were out in the fields with his livestock, he did nothing until they came back. 
01Gn 34:6 Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob, 
01Gn 34:7 just as Jacob's sons were coming in from the fields. When they heard about it, they were shocked and furious that Shechem had done such a thing and had insulted the people of Israel by raping Jacob's daughter. 
01Gn 34:8 Hamor said to him, "My son Shechem has fallen in love with your daughter; please let him marry her. 
01Gn 34:9 Let us make an agreement that there will be intermarriage between our people and yours. 
01Gn 34:10 Then you may stay here in our country with us; you may live anywhere you wish, trade freely, and own property." 
01Gn 34:11 Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Do me this favor, and I will give you whatever you want. 
01Gn 34:12 Tell me what presents you want, and set the payment for the bride as high as you wish; I will give you whatever you ask, if you will only let me marry her." 
01Gn 34:13 Because Shechem had disgraced their sister Dinah, Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor in a deceitful way. 
01Gn 34:14 They said to him, "We cannot let our sister marry a man who is not circumcised; that would be a disgrace for us. 
01Gn 34:15 We can agree only on the condition that you become like us by circumcising all your males. 
01Gn 34:16 Then we will agree to intermarriage. We will settle among you and become one people with you. 
01Gn 34:17 But if you will not accept our terms and be circumcised, we will take her and leave." 
01Gn 34:18 These terms seemed fair to Hamor and his son Shechem, 
01Gn 34:19 and the young man lost no time in doing what was suggested, because he was in love with Jacob's daughter. He was the most important member of his family. 
01Gn 34:20 Hamor and his son Shechem went to the meeting place at the city gate and spoke to the people of the town£º 
01Gn 34:21 "These men are friendly; let them live in the land with us and travel freely. The land is large enough for them also. Let us marry their daughters and give them ours in marriage. 
01Gn 34:22 But these men will agree to live among us and be one people with us only on the condition that we circumcise all our males, as they are circumcised. 
01Gn 34:23 Won't all their livestock and everything else they own be ours? So let us agree that they can live among us." 
01Gn 34:24 All the citizens of the city agreed with what Hamor and Shechem proposed, and all the males were circumcised. 
01Gn 34:25 Three days later, when the men were still sore from their circumcision, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, took their swords, went into the city without arousing suspicion, and killed all the men, 
01Gn 34:26 including Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 
01Gn 34:27 After the slaughter Jacob's other sons looted the town to take revenge for their sister's disgrace. 
01Gn 34:28 They took the flocks, the cattle, the donkeys, and everything else in the city and in the fields. 
01Gn 34:29 They took everything of value, captured all the women and children, and carried off everything in the houses. 
01Gn 34:30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have gotten me into trouble; now the Canaanites, the Perizzites, and everybody else in the land will hate me. I do not have many men; if they all band together against me and attack me, our whole family will be destroyed." 
01Gn 34:31 But they answered, "We cannot let our sister be treated like a common whore." 
01Gn 35:1 God said to Jacob, "Go to Bethel at once, and live there. Build an altar there to me, the God who appeared to you when you were running away from your brother Esau." 
01Gn 35:2 So Jacob said to his family and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods that you have; purify yourselves and put on clean clothes. 
01Gn 35:3 We are going to leave here and go to Bethel, where I will build an altar to the God who helped me in the time of my trouble and who has been with me everywhere I have gone." 
01Gn 35:4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that they had and also the earrings that they were wearing. He buried them beneath the oak tree near Shechem. 
01Gn 35:5 When Jacob and his sons started to leave, great fear fell on the people of the nearby towns, and they did not pursue them. 
01Gn 35:6 Jacob came with all his people to Luz, which is now known as Bethel, in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 35:7 He built an altar there and named the place for the God of Bethel, because God had revealed himself to him there when he was running away from his brother. 
01Gn 35:8 Rebecca's nurse Deborah died and was buried beneath the oak south of Bethel. So it was named "Oak of Weeping." 
01Gn 35:9 When Jacob returned from Mesopotamia, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
01Gn 35:10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but from now on it will be Israel." So God named him Israel. 
01Gn 35:11 And God said to him, "I am Almighty God. Have many children. Nations will be descended from you, and you will be the ancestor of kings. 
01Gn 35:12 I will give you the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, and I will also give it to your descendants after you." 
01Gn 35:13 Then God left him. 
01Gn 35:14 There, where God had spoken to him, Jacob set up a memorial stone and consecrated it by pouring wine and olive oil on it. 
01Gn 35:15 He named the place Bethel. 
01Gn 35:16 Jacob and his family left Bethel, and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, the time came for Rachel to have her baby, and she was having difficult labor. 
01Gn 35:17 When her labor pains were at their worst, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, Rachel; it's another boy." 
01Gn 35:18 But she was dying, and as she breathed her last, she named her son Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
01Gn 35:19 When Rachel died, she was buried beside the road to Ephrath, now known as Bethlehem. 
01Gn 35:20 Jacob set up a memorial stone there, and it still marks Rachel's grave to this day. 
01Gn 35:21 Jacob moved on and set up his camp on the other side of the tower of Eder. 
01Gn 35:22 While Jacob was living in that land, Reuben had sexual intercourse with Bilhah, one of his father's concubines; Jacob heard about it and was furious. Jacob had twelve sons. 
01Gn 35:23 The sons of Leah were Reuben (Jacob's oldest son), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
01Gn 35:24 The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. 
01Gn 35:25 The sons of Rachel's slave Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali. 
01Gn 35:26 The sons of Leah's slave Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These sons were born in Mesopotamia. 
01Gn 35:27 Jacob went to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had lived. 
01Gn 35:28 Isaac lived to be a hundred and eighty years old 
01Gn 35:29 and died at a ripe old age; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
01Gn 36:1 These are the descendants of Esau, also called Edom. 
01Gn 36:2 Esau married Canaanite women£º Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah son of Zibeon the Hivite; 
01Gn 36:3 and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth. 
01Gn 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel; 
01Gn 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons were born to Esau in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 36:6 Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the people of his house, along with all his livestock and all the possessions he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went away from his brother Jacob to another land. 
01Gn 36:7 He left because the land where he and Jacob were living was not able to support them; they had too much livestock and could no longer stay together. 
01Gn 36:8 So Esau lived in the hill country of Edom. 
01Gn 36:9 These are the descendants of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites. 
01Gn 36:10 Esau's wife Adah bore him one son, Eliphaz,
01Gn 36:11 and Eliphaz had five sons£º Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
01Gn 36:12 And by another wife, Timna, he had one more son, Amalek. 
01Gn 36:13 Esau's wife Basemath bore him one son, Reuel, and Reuel had four sons£º Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.
01Gn 36:14 Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah son of Zibeon, bore him three sons£º Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
01Gn 36:15 These are the tribes descended from Esau. Esau's first son Eliphaz was the ancestor of the following tribes£º Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
01Gn 36:16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These were all descendants of Esau's wife Adah. 
01Gn 36:17 Esau's son Reuel was the ancestor of the following tribes£º Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were all descendants of Esau's wife Basemath. 
01Gn 36:18 The following tribes were descended from Esau by his wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah£º Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 
01Gn 36:19 All these tribes were descended from Esau. 
01Gn 36:20 The original inhabitants of the land of Edom were divided into tribes which traced their ancestry to the following descendants of Seir, a Horite£º
01Gn 36:21 Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
01Gn 36:22 Lotan was the ancestor of the clans of Hori and Heman. (Lotan had a sister named Timna.) 
01Gn 36:23 Shobal was the ancestor of the clans of Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
01Gn 36:24 Zibeon had two sons, Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was taking care of his father's donkeys.) 
01Gn 36:25 Anah was the father of Dishon, who was the ancestor of the clans of Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
01Gn 36:26 Anah also had a daughter named Oholibamah. 
01Gn 36:27 Ezer was the ancestor of the clans of Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 
01Gn 36:28 Dishan was the ancestor of the clans of Uz and Aran. 
01Gn 36:29 These are the Horite tribes in the land of Edom£º Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
01Gn 36:30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
01Gn 36:31 Before there were any kings in Israel, the following kings ruled the land of Edom in succession£º
01Gn 36:32 Bela son of Beor from Dinhabah
01Gn 36:33 Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah
01Gn 36:34 Husham from the region of Teman
01Gn 36:35 Hadad son of Bedad from Avith (he defeated the Midianites in a battle in the country of Moab)
01Gn 36:36 Samlah from Masrekah
01Gn 36:37 Shaul from Rehoboth-on-the-River
01Gn 36:38 Baal Hanan son of Achbor
01Gn 36:39 Hadad from Pau (his wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Mezahab)
01Gn 36:40 Esau was the ancestor of the following Edomite tribes£º Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01Gn 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01Gn 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01Gn 36:43 Magdiel, and Iram. The area where each of these tribes lived was known by the name of the tribe.
01Gn 37:1 Jacob continued to live in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived, 
01Gn 37:2 and this is the story of Jacob's family. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, took care of the sheep and goats with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's concubines. He brought bad reports to his father about what his brothers were doing. 
01Gn 37:3 Jacob loved Joseph more than all his other sons, because he had been born to him when he was old. He made a long robe with full sleeves for him. 
01Gn 37:4 When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than he loved them, they hated their brother so much that they would not speak to him in a friendly manner. 
01Gn 37:5 One time Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more. 
01Gn 37:6 He said, "Listen to the dream I had. 
01Gn 37:7 We were all in the field tying up sheaves of wheat, when my sheaf got up and stood up straight. Yours formed a circle around mine and bowed down to it." 
01Gn 37:8 "Do you think you are going to be a king and rule over us?" his brothers asked. So they hated him even more because of his dreams and because of what he said about them. 
01Gn 37:9 Then Joseph had another dream and told his brothers, "I had another dream, in which I saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me." 
01Gn 37:10 He also told the dream to his father, and his father scolded him£º "What kind of a dream is that? Do you think that your mother, your brothers, and I are going to come and bow down to you?" 
01Gn 37:11 Joseph's brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept thinking about the whole matter. 
01Gn 37:12 One day when Joseph's brothers had gone to Shechem to take care of their father's flock, 
01Gn 37:13 Jacob said to Joseph, "I want you to go to Shechem, where your brothers are taking care of the flock." Joseph answered, "I am ready." 
01Gn 37:14 His father told him, "Go and see if your brothers are safe and if the flock is all right; then come back and tell me." So his father sent him on his way from Hebron Valley. Joseph arrived at Shechem 
01Gn 37:15 and was wandering around in the country when a man saw him and asked him, "What are you looking for?" 
01Gn 37:16 "I am looking for my brothers, who are taking care of their flock," he answered. "Can you tell me where they are?" 
01Gn 37:17 The man said, "They have already left. I heard them say that they were going to Dothan." So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan. 
01Gn 37:18 They saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted against him and decided to kill him. 
01Gn 37:19 They said to one another, "Here comes that dreamer. 
01Gn 37:20 Come on now, let's kill him and throw his body into one of the dry wells. We can say that a wild animal killed him. Then we will see what becomes of his dreams." 
01Gn 37:21 Reuben heard them and tried to save Joseph. "Let's not kill him," he said. 
01Gn 37:22 "Just throw him into this well in the wilderness, but don't hurt him." He said this, planning to save him from them and send him back to his father. 
01Gn 37:23 When Joseph came up to his brothers, they ripped off his long robe with full sleeves. 
01Gn 37:24 Then they took him and threw him into the well, which was dry. 
01Gn 37:25 While they were eating, they suddenly saw a group of Ishmaelites traveling from Gilead to Egypt. Their camels were loaded with spices and resins. 
01Gn 37:26 Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain by killing our brother and covering up the murder? 
01Gn 37:27 Let's sell him to these Ishmaelites. Then we won't have to hurt him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed, 
01Gn 37:28 and when some Midianite traders came by, the brothers pulled Joseph out of the well and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. 
01Gn 37:29 When Reuben came back to the well and found that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes in sorrow. 
01Gn 37:30 He returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is not there! What am I going to do?" 
01Gn 37:31 Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph's robe in its blood. 
01Gn 37:32 They took the robe to their father and said, "We found this. Does it belong to your son?" 
01Gn 37:33 He recognized it and said, "Yes, it is his! Some wild animal has killed him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!" 
01Gn 37:34 Jacob tore his clothes in sorrow and put on sackcloth. He mourned for his son a long time. 
01Gn 37:35 All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, "I will go down to the world of the dead still mourning for my son." So he continued to mourn for his son Joseph. 
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites had sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of the king's officers, who was the captain of the palace guard. 
01Gn 38:1 About that time Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah, who was from the town of Adullam. 
01Gn 38:2 There Judah met a young Canaanite woman whose father was named Shua. He married her, 
01Gn 38:3 and she bore him a son, whom he named Er. 
01Gn 38:4 She became pregnant again and bore another son and named him Onan. 
01Gn 38:5 Again she had a son and named him Shelah. Judah was at Achzib when the boy was born. 
01Gn 38:6 For his first son Er, Judah got a wife whose name was Tamar. 
01Gn 38:7 Er's conduct was evil, and it displeased the LORD, so the LORD killed him. 
01Gn 38:8 Then Judah said to Er's brother Onan, "Go and sleep with your brother's widow. Fulfill your obligation to her as her husband's brother, so that your brother may have descendants." 
01Gn 38:9 But Onan knew that the children would not belong to him, so when he had intercourse with his brother's widow, he let the semen spill on the ground, so that there would be no children for his brother. 
01Gn 38:10 What he did displeased the LORD, and the LORD killed him also. 
01Gn 38:11 Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Return to your father's house and remain a widow until my son Shelah grows up." He said this because he was afraid that Shelah would be killed, as his brothers had been. So Tamar went back home. 
01Gn 38:12 After some time Judah's wife died. When he had finished the time of mourning, he and his friend Hirah of Adullam went to Timnah, where his sheep were being sheared. 
01Gn 38:13 Someone told Tamar that her father-in-law was going to Timnah to shear his sheep. 
01Gn 38:14 So she changed from the widow's clothes she had been wearing, covered her face with a veil, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, a town on the road to Timnah. As she well knew, Judah's youngest son Shelah was now grown up, and yet she had not been given to him in marriage. 
01Gn 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, because she had her face covered. 
01Gn 38:16 He went over to her at the side of the road and said, "All right, how much do you charge?" (He did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.) She said, "What will you give me?" 
01Gn 38:17 He answered, "I will send you a young goat from my flock." She said, "All right, if you will give me something to keep as a pledge until you send the goat." 
01Gn 38:18 "What shall I give you as a pledge?" he asked. She answered, "Your seal with its cord and the walking stick you are carrying." He gave them to her. Then they had intercourse, and she became pregnant. 
01Gn 38:19 Tamar went home, took off her veil, and put her widow's clothes back on. 
01Gn 38:20 Judah sent his friend Hirah to take the goat and get back from the woman the articles he had pledged, but Hirah could not find her. 
01Gn 38:21 He asked some men at Enaim, "Where is the prostitute who was here by the road?" "There has never been a prostitute here," they answered. 
01Gn 38:22 He returned to Judah and said, "I couldn't find her. The men of the place said that there had never been a prostitute there." 
01Gn 38:23 Judah said, "Let her keep the things. We don't want people to laugh at us. I did try to pay her, but you couldn't find her." 
01Gn 38:24 About three months later someone told Judah, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been acting like a whore, and now she is pregnant." Judah ordered, "Take her out and burn her to death." 
01Gn 38:25 As she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law£º "I am pregnant by the man who owns these things. Look at them and see whose they are - this seal with its cord and this walking stick." 
01Gn 38:26 Judah recognized them and said, "She is in the right. I have failed in my obligation to her - I should have given her to my son Shelah in marriage." And Judah never had intercourse with her again. 
01Gn 38:27 When the time came for her to give birth, it was discovered that she was going to have twins. 
01Gn 38:28 While she was in labor, one of them put out an arm; the midwife caught it, tied a red thread around it, and said, "This one was born first." 
01Gn 38:29 But he pulled his arm back, and his brother was born first. Then the midwife said, "So this is how you break your way out!" So he was named Perez. 
01Gn 38:30 Then his brother was born with the red thread on his arm, and he was named Zerah. 
01Gn 39:1 Now the Ishmaelites had taken Joseph to Egypt and sold him to Potiphar, one of the king's officers, who was the captain of the palace guard. 
01Gn 39:2 The LORD was with Joseph and made him successful. He lived in the house of his Egyptian master, 
01Gn 39:3 who saw that the LORD was with Joseph and had made him successful in everything he did. 
01Gn 39:4 Potiphar was pleased with him and made him his personal servant; so he put him in charge of his house and everything he owned. 
01Gn 39:5 From then on, because of Joseph the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian and everything that he had in his house and in his fields. 
01Gn 39:6 Potiphar turned over everything he had to the care of Joseph and did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Joseph was well-built and good-looking, 
01Gn 39:7 and after a while his master's wife began to desire Joseph and asked him to go to bed with her. 
01Gn 39:8 He refused and said to her, "Look, my master does not have to concern himself with anything in the house, because I am here. He has put me in charge of everything he has. 
01Gn 39:9 I have as much authority in this house as he has, and he has not kept back anything from me except you. How then could I do such an immoral thing and sin against God?" 
01Gn 39:10 Although she asked Joseph day after day, he would not go to bed with her. 
01Gn 39:11 But one day when Joseph went into the house to do his work, none of the house servants was there. 
01Gn 39:12 She caught him by his robe and said, "Come to bed with me." But he escaped and ran outside, leaving his robe in her hand. 
01Gn 39:13 When she saw that he had left his robe and had run out of the house, 
01Gn 39:14 she called to her house servants and said, "Look at this! This Hebrew that my husband brought to the house is insulting us. He came into my room and tried to rape me, but I screamed as loud as I could. 
01Gn 39:15 When he heard me scream, he ran outside, leaving his robe beside me." 
01Gn 39:16 She kept his robe with her until Joseph's master came home. 
01Gn 39:17 Then she told him the same story£º "That Hebrew slave that you brought here came into my room and insulted me. 
01Gn 39:18 But when I screamed, he ran outside, leaving his robe beside me." 
01Gn 39:19 Joseph's master was furious 
01Gn 39:20 and had Joseph arrested and put in the prison where the king's prisoners were kept, and there he stayed. 
01Gn 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph and blessed him, so that the jailer was pleased with him. 
01Gn 39:22 He put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and made him responsible for everything that was done in the prison. 
01Gn 39:23 The jailer did not have to look after anything for which Joseph was responsible, because the LORD was with Joseph and made him succeed in everything he did. 
01Gn 40:1 Some time later the king of Egypt's wine steward and his chief baker offended the king. 
01Gn 40:2 He was angry with these two officials 
01Gn 40:3 and put them in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same place where Joseph was being kept. 
01Gn 40:4 They spent a long time in prison, and the captain assigned Joseph as their servant. 
01Gn 40:5 One night there in prison the wine steward and the chief baker each had a dream, and the dreams had different meanings. 
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were upset. 
01Gn 40:7 He asked them, "Why do you look so worried today?" 
01Gn 40:8 They answered, "Each of us had a dream, and there is no one here to explain what the dreams mean." "It is God who gives the ability to interpret dreams," Joseph said. "Tell me your dreams." 
01Gn 40:9 So the wine steward said, "In my dream there was a grapevine in front of me 
01Gn 40:10 with three branches on it. As soon as the leaves came out, the blossoms appeared, and the grapes ripened. 
01Gn 40:11 I was holding the king's cup; so I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup and gave it to him." 
01Gn 40:12 Joseph said, "This is what it means£º the three branches are three days. 
01Gn 40:13 In three days the king will release you, pardon you, and restore you to your position. You will give him his cup as you did before when you were his wine steward. 
01Gn 40:14 But please remember me when everything is going well for you, and please be kind enough to mention me to the king and help me get out of this prison. 
01Gn 40:15 After all, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here in Egypt I didn't do anything to deserve being put in prison." 
01Gn 40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation of the wine steward's dream was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I had a dream too; I was carrying three breadbaskets on my head. 
01Gn 40:17 In the top basket there were all kinds of baked goods for the king, and the birds were eating them." 
01Gn 40:18 Joseph answered, "This is what it means£º the three baskets are three days. 
01Gn 40:19 In three days the king will release you - and have your head cut off! Then he will hang your body on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh." 
01Gn 40:20 On his birthday three days later the king gave a banquet for all his officials; he released his wine steward and his chief baker and brought them before his officials. 
01Gn 40:21 He restored the wine steward to his former position, 
01Gn 40:22 but he executed the chief baker. It all happened just as Joseph had said. 
01Gn 40:23 But the wine steward never gave Joseph another thought - he forgot all about him. 
01Gn 41:1 After two years had passed, the king of Egypt dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River, 
01Gn 41:2 when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and began to feed on the grass. 
01Gn 41:3 Then seven other cows came up; they were thin and bony. They came and stood by the other cows on the riverbank, 
01Gn 41:4 and the thin cows ate up the fat cows. Then the king woke up. 
01Gn 41:5 He fell asleep again and had another dream. Seven heads of grain, full and ripe, were growing on one stalk. 
01Gn 41:6 Then seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the desert wind, 
01Gn 41:7 and the thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. The king woke up and realized that he had been dreaming. 
01Gn 41:8 In the morning he was worried, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. He told them his dreams, but no one could explain them to him. 
01Gn 41:9 Then the wine steward said to the king, "I must confess today that I have done wrong. 
01Gn 41:10 You were angry with the chief baker and me, and you put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard. 
01Gn 41:11 One night each of us had a dream, and the dreams had different meanings. 
01Gn 41:12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a slave of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us. 
01Gn 41:13 Things turned out just as he said£º you restored me to my position, but you executed the baker." 
01Gn 41:14 The king sent for Joseph, and he was immediately brought from the prison. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came into the king's presence. 
01Gn 41:15 The king said to him, "I have had a dream, and no one can explain it. I have been told that you can interpret dreams." 
01Gn 41:16 Joseph answered, "I cannot, Your Majesty, but God will give a favorable interpretation." 
01Gn 41:17 The king said, "I dreamed that I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
01Gn 41:18 when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and began feeding on the grass. 
01Gn 41:19 Then seven other cows came up which were thin and bony. They were the poorest cows I have ever seen anywhere in Egypt. 
01Gn 41:20 The thin cows ate up the fat ones, 
01Gn 41:21 but no one would have known it, because they looked just as bad as before. Then I woke up. 
01Gn 41:22 I also dreamed that I saw seven heads of grain which were full and ripe, growing on one stalk. 
01Gn 41:23 Then seven heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the desert wind, 
01Gn 41:24 and the thin heads of grain swallowed the full ones. I told the dreams to the magicians, but none of them could explain them to me." 
01Gn 41:25 Joseph said to the king, "The two dreams mean the same thing; God has told you what he is going to do. 
01Gn 41:26 The seven fat cows are seven years, and the seven full heads of grain are also seven years; they have the same meaning. 
01Gn 41:27 The seven thin cows which came up later and the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the desert wind are seven years of famine. 
01Gn 41:28 It is just as I told you - God has shown you what he is going to do. 
01Gn 41:29 There will be seven years of great plenty in all the land of Egypt. 
01Gn 41:30 After that, there will be seven years of famine, and all the good years will be forgotten, because the famine will ruin the country. 
01Gn 41:31 The time of plenty will be entirely forgotten, because the famine which follows will be so terrible. 
01Gn 41:32 The repetition of your dream means that the matter is fixed by God and that he will make it happen in the near future. 
01Gn 41:33 "Now you should choose some man with wisdom and insight and put him in charge of the country. 
01Gn 41:34 You must also appoint other officials and take a fifth of the crops during the seven years of plenty. 
01Gn 41:35 Order them to collect all the food during the good years that are coming, and give them authority to store up grain in the cities and guard it. 
01Gn 41:36 The food will be a reserve supply for the country during the seven years of famine which are going to come on Egypt. In this way the people will not starve." 
01Gn 41:37 The king and his officials approved this plan, 
01Gn 41:38 and he said to them, "We will never find a better man than Joseph, a man who has God's spirit in him." 
01Gn 41:39 The king said to Joseph, "God has shown you all this, so it is obvious that you have greater wisdom and insight than anyone else. 
01Gn 41:40 I will put you in charge of my country, and all my people will obey your orders. Your authority will be second only to mine. 
01Gn 41:41 I now appoint you governor over all Egypt." 
01Gn 41:42 The king removed from his finger the ring engraved with the royal seal and put it on Joseph's finger. He put a fine linen robe on him, and placed a gold chain around his neck. 
01Gn 41:43 He gave him the second royal chariot to ride in, and his guard of honor went ahead of him and cried out, "Make way! Make way!" And so Joseph was appointed governor over all Egypt. 
01Gn 41:44 The king said to him, "I am the king - and no one in all Egypt shall so much as lift a hand or a foot without your permission." 
01Gn 41:45 He gave Joseph the Egyptian name Zaphenath Paneah, and he gave him a wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in the city of Heliopolis.
01Gn 41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he began to serve the king of Egypt. He left the king's court and traveled all over the land. 
01Gn 41:47 During the seven years of plenty the land produced abundant crops, 
01Gn 41:48 all of which Joseph collected and stored in the cities. In each city he stored the food from the fields around it. 
01Gn 41:49 There was so much grain that Joseph stopped measuring it - it was like the sand of the sea. 
01Gn 41:50 Before the years of famine came, Joseph had two sons by Asenath. 
01Gn 41:51 He said, "God has made me forget all my sufferings and all my father's family"; so he named his first son Manasseh. 
01Gn 41:52 He also said, "God has given me children in the land of my trouble"; so he named his second son Ephraim. 
01Gn 41:53 The seven years of plenty that the land of Egypt had enjoyed came to an end, 
01Gn 41:54 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every other country, but there was food throughout Egypt. 
01Gn 41:55 When the Egyptians began to be hungry, they cried out to the king for food. So he ordered them to go to Joseph and do what he told them. 
01Gn 41:56 The famine grew worse and spread over the whole country, so Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians. 
01Gn 41:57 People came to Egypt from all over the world to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere. 
01Gn 42:1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why don't you do something? 
01Gn 42:2 I hear that there is grain in Egypt; go there and buy some to keep us from starving to death." 
01Gn 42:3 So Joseph's ten half brothers went to buy grain in Egypt, 
01Gn 42:4 but Jacob did not send Joseph's full brother Benjamin with them, because he was afraid that something might happen to him. 
01Gn 42:5 The sons of Jacob came with others to buy grain, because there was famine in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 42:6 Joseph, as governor of the land of Egypt, was selling grain to people from all over the world. So Joseph's brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. 
01Gn 42:7 When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he acted as if he did not know them. He asked them harshly, "Where do you come from?" "We have come from Canaan to buy food," they answered. 
01Gn 42:8 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
01Gn 42:9 He remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them and said, "You are spies; you have come to find out where our country is weak." 
01Gn 42:10 "No, sir," they answered. "We have come as your slaves, to buy food. 
01Gn 42:11 We are all brothers. We are not spies, sir, we are honest men." 
01Gn 42:12 Joseph said to them, "No! You have come to find out where our country is weak." 
01Gn 42:13 They said, "We were twelve brothers in all, sir, sons of the same man in the land of Canaan. One brother is dead, and the youngest is now with our father." 
01Gn 42:14 "It is just as I said," Joseph answered. "You are spies. 
01Gn 42:15 This is how you will be tested£º I swear by the name of the king that you will never leave unless your youngest brother comes here. 
01Gn 42:16 One of you must go and get him. The rest of you will be kept under guard until the truth of what you say can be tested. Otherwise, as sure as the king lives, you are spies." 
01Gn 42:17 With that, he put them in prison for three days. 
01Gn 42:18 On the third day Joseph said to them, "I am a God-fearing man, and I will spare your lives on one condition. 
01Gn 42:19 To prove that you are honest, one of you will stay in the prison where you have been kept; the rest of you may go and take back to your starving families the grain that you have bought. 
01Gn 42:20 Then you must bring your youngest brother to me. This will prove that you have been telling the truth, and I will not put you to death." They agreed to this 
01Gn 42:21 and said to one another, "Yes, now we are suffering the consequences of what we did to our brother; we saw the great trouble he was in when he begged for help, but we would not listen. That is why we are in this trouble now." 
01Gn 42:22 Reuben said, "I told you not to harm the boy, but you wouldn't listen. And now we are being paid back for his death." 
01Gn 42:23 Joseph understood what they said, but they did not know it, because they had been speaking to him through an interpreter. 
01Gn 42:24 Joseph left them and began to cry. When he was able to speak again, he came back, picked out Simeon, and had him tied up in front of them. 
01Gn 42:25 Joseph gave orders to fill his brothers' packs with grain, to put each man's money back in his sack, and to give them food for the trip. This was done. 
01Gn 42:26 The brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain they had bought, and then they left. 
01Gn 42:27 At the place where they spent the night, one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey and found his money at the top of the sack. 
01Gn 42:28 "My money has been returned to me," he called to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack!" Their hearts sank, and in fear they asked one another, "What has God done to us?" 
01Gn 42:29 When they came to their father Jacob in Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them£º 
01Gn 42:30 "The governor of Egypt spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying against his country. 
01Gn 42:31 'We are not spies,' we answered, 'we are honest men. 
01Gn 42:32 We were twelve brothers in all, sons of the same father. One brother is dead, and the youngest is still in Canaan with our father.' 
01Gn 42:33 The man answered, 'This is how I will find out if you are honest men£º One of you will stay with me; the rest will take grain for your starving families and leave. 
01Gn 42:34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but honest men; I will give your brother back to you, and you can stay here and trade.' " 
01Gn 42:35 Then when they emptied out their sacks, every one of them found his bag of money; and when they saw the money, they and their father Jacob were afraid. 
01Gn 42:36 Their father said to them, "Do you want to make me lose all my children? Joseph is gone; Simeon is gone; and now you want to take away Benjamin. I am the one who suffers!" 
01Gn 42:37 Reuben said to his father, "If I do not bring Benjamin back to you, you can kill my two sons. Put him in my care, and I will bring him back." 
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob said, "My son cannot go with you; his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. Something might happen to him on the way. I am an old man, and the sorrow you would cause me would kill me." 
01Gn 43:1 The famine in Canaan got worse, 
01Gn 43:2 and when the family of Jacob had eaten all the grain which had been brought from Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, "Go back and buy a little food for us." 
01Gn 43:3 Judah said to him, "The man sternly warned us that we would not be admitted to his presence unless we had our brother with us. 
01Gn 43:4 If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go and buy food for you. 
01Gn 43:5 If you are not willing, we will not go, because the man told us we would not be admitted to his presence unless our brother was with us." 
01Gn 43:6 Jacob said, "Why did you cause me so much trouble by telling the man that you had another brother?" 
01Gn 43:7 They answered, "The man kept asking about us and our family, 'Is your father still living? Do you have another brother?' We had to answer his questions. How could we know that he would tell us to bring our brother with us?" 
01Gn 43:8 Judah said to his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will leave at once. Then none of us will starve to death. 
01Gn 43:9 I will pledge my own life, and you can hold me responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you safe and sound, I will always bear the blame. 
01Gn 43:10 If we had not waited so long, we could have been there and back twice by now." 
01Gn 43:11 Their father said to them, "If that is how it has to be, then take the best products of the land in your packs as a present for the governor£º a little resin, a little honey, spices, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
01Gn 43:12 Take with you also twice as much money, because you must take back the money that was returned in the top of your sacks. Maybe it was a mistake. 
01Gn 43:13 Take your brother and return at once. 
01Gn 43:14 May Almighty God cause the man to have pity on you, so that he will give Benjamin and your other brother back to you. As for me, if I must lose my children, I must lose them." 
01Gn 43:15 So the brothers took the gifts and twice as much money, and set out for Egypt with Benjamin. There they presented themselves to Joseph. 
01Gn 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant in charge of his house, "Take these men to my house. They are going to eat with me at noon, so kill an animal and prepare it." 
01Gn 43:17 The servant did as he was commanded and took the brothers to Joseph's house. 
01Gn 43:18 As they were being brought to the house, they were afraid and thought, "We are being brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time. They will suddenly attack us, take our donkeys, and make us his slaves." 
01Gn 43:19 So at the door of the house, they said to the servant in charge, 
01Gn 43:20 "If you please, sir, we came here once before to buy food. 
01Gn 43:21 When we set up camp on the way home, we opened our sacks, and each man found his money in the top of his sack - every bit of it. We have brought it back to you. 
01Gn 43:22 We have also brought some more money with us to buy more food. We do not know who put our money back in our sacks." 
01Gn 43:23 The servant said, "Don't worry. Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put the money in your sacks for you. I received your payment." Then he brought Simeon to them. 
01Gn 43:24 The servant took the brothers into the house. He gave them water so that they could wash their feet, and he fed their donkeys. 
01Gn 43:25 They got their gifts ready to present to Joseph when he arrived at noon, because they had been told that they were to eat with him. 
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph got home, they took the gifts into the house to him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
01Gn 43:27 He asked about their health and then said, "You told me about your old father - how is he? Is he still alive and well?" 
01Gn 43:28 They answered, "Your humble servant, our father, is still alive and well." And they knelt and bowed down before him. 
01Gn 43:29 When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin, he said, "So this is your youngest brother, the one you told me about. God bless you, my son." 
01Gn 43:30 Then Joseph left suddenly, because his heart was full of tender feelings for his brother. He was about to break down, so he went to his room and cried. 
01Gn 43:31 After he had washed his face, he came out, and controlling himself, he ordered the meal to be served. 
01Gn 43:32 Joseph was served at one table and his brothers at another. The Egyptians who were eating there were served separately, because they considered it beneath their dignity to eat with Hebrews. 
01Gn 43:33 The brothers had been seated at the table, facing Joseph, in the order of their age from the oldest to the youngest. When they saw how they had been seated, they looked at one another in amazement. 
01Gn 43:34 Food was served to them from Joseph's table, and Benjamin was served five times as much as the rest of them. So they ate and drank with Joseph until they were drunk. 
01Gn 44:1 Joseph commanded the servant in charge of his house, "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's money in the top of his sack. 
01Gn 44:2 Put my silver cup in the top of the youngest brother's sack, together with the money for his grain." He did as he was told. 
01Gn 44:3 Early in the morning the brothers were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
01Gn 44:4 When they had gone only a short distance from the city, Joseph said to the servant in charge of his house, "Hurry after those men. When you catch up with them, ask them, 'Why have you paid back evil for good? 
01Gn 44:5 Why did you steal my master's silver cup? It is the one he drinks from, the one he uses for divination. You have committed a serious crime!' " 
01Gn 44:6 When the servant caught up with them, he repeated these words. 
01Gn 44:7 They answered him, "What do you mean, sir, by talking like this? We swear that we have done no such thing. 
01Gn 44:8 You know that we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in the top of our sacks. Why then should we steal silver or gold from your master's house? 
01Gn 44:9 Sir, if any one of us is found to have it, he will be put to death, and the rest of us will become your slaves." 
01Gn 44:10 He said, "I agree; but only the one who has taken the cup will become my slave, and the rest of you can go free." 
01Gn 44:11 So they quickly lowered their sacks to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 
01Gn 44:12 Joseph's servant searched carefully, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
01Gn 44:13 The brothers tore their clothes in sorrow, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city. 
01Gn 44:14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They bowed down before him, 
01Gn 44:15 and Joseph said, "What have you done? Didn't you know that a man in my position could find you out by practicing divination?" 
01Gn 44:16 "What can we say to you, sir?" Judah answered. "How can we argue? How can we clear ourselves? God has uncovered our guilt. All of us are now your slaves and not just the one with whom the cup was found." 
01Gn 44:17 Joseph said, "Oh, no! I would never do that! Only the one who had the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go back safe and sound to your father." 
01Gn 44:18 Judah went up to Joseph and said, "Please, sir, allow me to speak with you freely. Don't be angry with me; you are like the king himself. 
01Gn 44:19 Sir, you asked us, 'Do you have a father or another brother?' 
01Gn 44:20 We answered, 'We have a father who is old and a younger brother, born to him in his old age. The boy's brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's children still alive; his father loves him very much.' 
01Gn 44:21 Sir, you told us to bring him here, so that you could see him, 
01Gn 44:22 and we answered that the boy could not leave his father; if he did, his father would die. 
01Gn 44:23 Then you said, 'You will not be admitted to my presence again unless your youngest brother comes with you.' 
01Gn 44:24 "When we went back to our father, we told him what you had said. 
01Gn 44:25 Then he told us to return and buy a little food. 
01Gn 44:26 We answered, 'We cannot go; we will not be admitted to the man's presence unless our youngest brother is with us. We can go only if our youngest brother goes also.' 
01Gn 44:27 Our father said to us, 'You know that my wife Rachel bore me only two sons. 
01Gn 44:28 One of them has already left me. He must have been torn to pieces by wild animals, because I have not seen him since he left. 
01Gn 44:29 If you take this one from me now and something happens to him, the sorrow you would cause me would kill me, as old as I am.' 
01Gn 44:30 "And now, sir," Judah continued, "if I go back to my father without the boy, 
01Gn 44:31 as soon as he sees that the boy is not with me, he will die. His life is wrapped up with the life of the boy, and he is so old that the sorrow we would cause him would kill him.
01Gn 44:32 What is more, I pledged my life to my father for the boy. I told him that if I did not bring the boy back to him, I would bear the blame all my life. 
01Gn 44:33 And now, sir, I will stay here as your slave in place of the boy; let him go back with his brothers. 
01Gn 44:34 How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I cannot bear to see this disaster come upon my father." 
01Gn 45:1 Joseph was no longer able to control his feelings in front of his servants, so he ordered them all to leave the room. No one else was with him when Joseph told his brothers who he was. 
01Gn 45:2 He cried with such loud sobs that the Egyptians heard it, and the news was taken to the king's palace. 
01Gn 45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But when his brothers heard this, they were so terrified that they could not answer. 
01Gn 45:4 Then Joseph said to them, "Please come closer." They did, and he said, "I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. 
01Gn 45:5 Now do not be upset or blame yourselves because you sold me here. It was really God who sent me ahead of you to save people's lives. 
01Gn 45:6 This is only the second year of famine in the land; there will be five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor reaping. 
01Gn 45:7 God sent me ahead of you to rescue you in this amazing way and to make sure that you and your descendants survive. 
01Gn 45:8 So it was not really you who sent me here, but God. He has made me the king's highest official. I am in charge of his whole country; I am the ruler of all Egypt. 
01Gn 45:9 "Now hurry back to my father and tell him that this is what his son Joseph says£º 'God has made me ruler of all Egypt; come to me without delay. 
01Gn 45:10 You can live in the region of Goshen, where you can be near me - you, your children, your grandchildren, your sheep, your goats, your cattle, and everything else that you have. 
01Gn 45:11 If you are in Goshen, I can take care of you. There will still be five years of famine; and I do not want you, your family, and your livestock to starve.' " 
01Gn 45:12 Joseph continued, "Now all of you, and you too, Benjamin, can see that I am really Joseph. 
01Gn 45:13 Tell my father how powerful I am here in Egypt and tell him about everything that you have seen. Then hurry and bring him here." 
01Gn 45:14 He threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and began to cry; Benjamin also cried as he hugged him. 
01Gn 45:15 Then, still weeping, he embraced each of his brothers and kissed them. After that, his brothers began to talk with him. 
01Gn 45:16 When the news reached the palace that Joseph's brothers had come, the king and his officials were pleased. 
01Gn 45:17 He said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers to load their animals and to return to the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 45:18 Let them get their father and their families and come back here. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they will have more than enough to live on. 
01Gn 45:19 Tell them also to take wagons with them from Egypt for their wives and small children and to bring their father with them. 
01Gn 45:20 They are not to worry about leaving their possessions behind; the best in the whole land of Egypt will be theirs." 
01Gn 45:21 Jacob's sons did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons, as the king had ordered, and food for the trip. 
01Gn 45:22 He also gave each of them a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothes. 
01Gn 45:23 He sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best Egyptian goods and ten donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food for the trip. 
01Gn 45:24 He sent his brothers off and as they left, he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way." 
01Gn 45:25 They left Egypt and went back home to their father Jacob in Canaan. 
01Gn 45:26 "Joseph is still alive!" they told him. "He is the ruler of all Egypt!" Jacob was stunned and could not believe them. 
01Gn 45:27 But when they told him all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to take him to Egypt, he recovered from the shock. 
01Gn 45:28 "My son Joseph is still alive!" he said. "This is all I could ask for! I must go and see him before I die." 
01Gn 46:1 Jacob packed up all he had and went to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
01Gn 46:2 God spoke to him in a vision at night and called, "Jacob, Jacob!" "Yes, here I am," he answered. 
01Gn 46:3 "I am God, the God of your father," he said. "Do not be afraid to go to Egypt; I will make your descendants a great nation there. 
01Gn 46:4 I will go with you to Egypt, and I will bring your descendants back to this land. Joseph will be with you when you die." 
01Gn 46:5 Jacob set out from Beersheba. His sons put him, their small children, and their wives in the wagons which the king of Egypt had sent. 
01Gn 46:6 They took their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt. Jacob took all his descendants with him£º 
01Gn 46:7 his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters. 
01Gn 46:8 The members of Jacob's family who went to Egypt with him were his oldest son Reuben 
01Gn 46:9 and Reuben's sons£º Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 
01Gn 46:10 Simeon and his sons£º Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. 
01Gn 46:11 Levi and his sons£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
01Gn 46:12 Judah and his sons£º Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. (Judah's other sons, Er and Onan, had died in Canaan.) Perez' sons were Hezron and Hamul. 
01Gn 46:13 Issachar and his sons£º Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron. 
01Gn 46:14 Zebulun and his sons£º Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
01Gn 46:15 These are the sons that Leah had borne to Jacob in Mesopotamia, besides his daughter Dinah. In all, his descendants by Leah numbered thirty-three. 
01Gn 46:16 Gad and his sons£º Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arod, and Areli. 
01Gn 46:17 Asher and his sons£º Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel. 
01Gn 46:18 These sixteen are the descendants of Jacob by Zilpah, the slave woman whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. 
01Gn 46:19 Jacob's wife Rachel bore him two sons£º Joseph and Benjamin. 
01Gn 46:20 In Egypt Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, by Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, a priest in Heliopolis. 
01Gn 46:21 Benjamin's sons were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
01Gn 46:22 These fourteen are the descendants of Jacob by Rachel. 
01Gn 46:23 Dan and his son Hushim. 
01Gn 46:24 Naphtali and his sons£º Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
01Gn 46:25 These seven are the descendants of Jacob by Bilhah, the slave woman whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. 
01Gn 46:26 The total number of the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt was sixty-six, not including his sons' wives. 
01Gn 46:27 Two sons were born to Joseph in Egypt, bringing to seventy the total number of Jacob's family who went there. 
01Gn 46:28 Jacob sent Judah ahead to ask Joseph to meet them in Goshen. When they arrived, 
01Gn 46:29 Joseph got in his chariot and went to Goshen to meet his father. When they met, Joseph threw his arms around his father's neck and cried for a long time. 
01Gn 46:30 Jacob said to Joseph, "I am ready to die, now that I have seen you and know that you are still alive." 
01Gn 46:31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and the rest of his father's family, "I must go and tell the king that my brothers and all my father's family, who were living in Canaan, have come to me. 
01Gn 46:32 I will tell him that you are shepherds and take care of livestock and that you have brought your flocks and herds and everything else that belongs to you. 
01Gn 46:33 When the king calls for you and asks what your occupation is, 
01Gn 46:34 be sure to tell him that you have taken care of livestock all your lives, just as your ancestors did. In this way he will let you live in the region of Goshen." Joseph said this because Egyptians will have nothing to do with shepherds. 
01Gn 47:1 So Joseph took five of his brothers and went to the king. He told him, "My father and my brothers have come from Canaan with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own. They are now in the region of Goshen." 
01Gn 47:2 He then presented his brothers to the king. 
01Gn 47:3 The king asked them, "What is your occupation?" "We are shepherds, sir, just as our ancestors were," they answered. 
01Gn 47:4 "We have come to live in this country, because in the land of Canaan the famine is so severe that there is no pasture for our flocks. Please give us permission to live in the region of Goshen." 
01Gn 47:5 The king said to Joseph, "Now that your father and your brothers have arrived, 
01Gn 47:6 the land of Egypt is theirs. Let them settle in the region of Goshen, the best part of the land. And if there are any capable men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock." 
01Gn 47:7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him to the king. Jacob gave the king his blessing, 
01Gn 47:8 and the king asked him, "How old are you?" 
01Gn 47:9 Jacob answered, "My life of wandering has lasted a hundred and thirty years. Those years have been few and difficult, unlike the long years of my ancestors in their wanderings." 
01Gn 47:10 Jacob gave the king a farewell blessing and left. 
01Gn 47:11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt, giving them property in the best of the land near the city of Rameses, as the king had commanded. 
01Gn 47:12 Joseph provided food for his father, his brothers, and all the rest of his father's family, including the very youngest. 
01Gn 47:13 The famine was so severe that there was no food anywhere, and the people of Egypt and Canaan became weak with hunger. 
01Gn 47:14 As they bought grain, Joseph collected all the money and took it to the palace. 
01Gn 47:15 When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was spent, the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, "Give us food! Don't let us die. Do something! Our money is all gone." 
01Gn 47:16 Joseph answered, "Bring your livestock; I will give you food in exchange for it if your money is all gone." 
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. That year he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock. 
01Gn 47:18 The following year they came to him and said, "We will not hide the fact from you, sir, that our money is all gone and our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left to give you except our bodies and our lands. 
01Gn 47:19 Don't let us die. Do something! Don't let our fields be deserted. Buy us and our land in exchange for food. We will be the king's slaves, and he will own our land. Give us grain to keep us alive and seed so that we can plant our fields." 
01Gn 47:20 Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king. Every Egyptian was forced to sell his land, because the famine was so severe; and all the land became the king's property. 
01Gn 47:21 Joseph made slaves of the people from one end of Egypt to the other. 
01Gn 47:22 The only land he did not buy was the land that belonged to the priests. They did not have to sell their lands, because the king gave them an allowance to live on. 
01Gn 47:23 Joseph said to the people, "You see, I have now bought you and your lands for the king. Here is seed for you to sow in your fields. 
01Gn 47:24 At the time of harvest you must give one-fifth to the king. You can use the rest for seed and for food for yourselves and your families." 
01Gn 47:25 They answered, "You have saved our lives; you have been good to us, sir, and we will be the king's slaves." 
01Gn 47:26 So Joseph made it a law for the land of Egypt that one-fifth of the harvest should belong to the king. This law still remains in force today. Only the lands of the priests did not become the king's property. 
01Gn 47:27 The Israelites lived in Egypt in the region of Goshen, where they became rich and had many children. 
01Gn 47:28 Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, until he was a hundred and forty-seven years old. 
01Gn 47:29 When the time drew near for him to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "Place your hand between my thighs and make a solemn vow that you will not bury me in Egypt. 
01Gn 47:30 I want to be buried where my fathers are; carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried." Joseph answered, "I will do as you say." 
01Gn 47:31 Jacob said, "Make a vow that you will." Joseph made the vow, and Jacob gave thanks there on his bed. 
01Gn 48:1 Some time later Joseph was told that his father was ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see Jacob. 
01Gn 48:2 When Jacob was told that his son Joseph had come to see him, he gathered his strength and sat up in bed. 
01Gn 48:3 Jacob said to Joseph, "Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me. 
01Gn 48:4 He said to me, 'I will give you many children, so that your descendants will become many nations; I will give this land to your descendants as their possession forever.' " 
01Gn 48:5 Jacob continued, "Joseph, your two sons, who were born to you in Egypt before I came here, belong to me; Ephraim and Manasseh are just as much my sons as Reuben and Simeon. 
01Gn 48:6 If you have any more sons, they will not be considered mine; the inheritance they get will come through Ephraim and Manasseh. 
01Gn 48:7 I am doing this because of your mother Rachel. To my great sorrow she died in the land of Canaan, not far from Ephrath, as I was returning from Mesopotamia. I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath." (Ephrath is now known as Bethlehem.) 
01Gn 48:8 When Jacob saw Joseph's sons, he asked, "Who are these boys?" 
01Gn 48:9 Joseph answered, "These are my sons, whom God has given me here in Egypt." Jacob said, "Bring them to me so that I may bless them." 
01Gn 48:10 Jacob's eyesight was failing because of his age, and he could not see very well. Joseph brought the boys to him, and he hugged them and kissed them. 
01Gn 48:11 Jacob said to Joseph, "I never expected to see you again, and now God has even let me see your children." 
01Gn 48:12 Then Joseph took them from Jacob's lap and bowed down before him with his face to the ground. 
01Gn 48:13 Joseph put Ephraim at Jacob's left and Manasseh at his right. 
01Gn 48:14 But Jacob crossed his hands, and put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, even though he was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, who was the older. 
01Gn 48:15 Then he blessed Joseph£º "May God, whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac served, bless these boys! May God, who has led me to this very day, bless them! 
01Gn 48:16 May the angel, who has rescued me from all harm, bless them! May my name and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac live on through these boys! May they have many children, many descendants!" 
01Gn 48:17 Joseph was upset when he saw that his father had put his right hand on Ephraim's head; so he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to the head of Manasseh. 
01Gn 48:18 He said to his father, "Not that way, father. This is the older boy; put your right hand on his head." 
01Gn 48:19 His father refused, saying, "I know, son, I know. Manasseh's descendants will also become a great people. But his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become great nations." 
01Gn 48:20 So he blessed them that day, saying, "The Israelites will use your names when they pronounce blessings. They will say, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.' " In this way Jacob put Ephraim before Manasseh. 
01Gn 48:21 Then Jacob said to Joseph, "As you see, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will take you back to the land of your ancestors. 
01Gn 48:22 It is to you and not to your brothers that I am giving Shechem, that fertile region which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow." 
01Gn 49:1 Jacob called for his sons and said, "Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future£º 
01Gn 49:2 "Come together and listen, sons of Jacob. Listen to your father Israel. 
01Gn 49:3 "Reuben, my first-born, you are my strength And the first child of my manhood, The proudest and strongest of all my sons. 
01Gn 49:4 You are like a raging flood, But you will not be the most important, For you slept with my concubine And dishonored your father's bed. 
01Gn 49:5 "Simeon and Levi are brothers. They use their weapons to commit violence. 
01Gn 49:6 I will not join in their secret talks, Nor will I take part in their meetings, For they killed people in anger And they crippled bulls for sport. 
01Gn 49:7 A curse be on their anger, because it is so fierce, And on their fury, because it is so cruel. I will scatter them throughout the land of Israel. I will disperse them among its people. 
01Gn 49:8 "Judah, your brothers will praise you. You hold your enemies by the neck. Your brothers will bow down before you. 
01Gn 49:9 Judah is like a lion, Killing his victim and returning to his den, Stretching out and lying down. No one dares disturb him. 
01Gn 49:10 Judah will hold the royal scepter, And his descendants will always rule. Nations will bring him tribute And bow in obedience before him. 
01Gn 49:11 He ties his young donkey to a grapevine, To the very best of the vines. He washes his clothes in blood-red wine. 
01Gn 49:12 His eyes are bloodshot from drinking wine, His teeth white from drinking milk. 
01Gn 49:13 "Zebulun will live beside the sea. His shore will be a haven for ships. His territory will reach as far as Sidon. 
01Gn 49:14 "Issachar is no better than a donkey That lies stretched out between its saddlebags. 
01Gn 49:15 But he sees that the resting place is good And that the land is delightful. So he bends his back to carry the load And is forced to work as a slave. 
01Gn 49:16 "Dan will be a ruler for his people. They will be like the other tribes of Israel. 
01Gn 49:17 Dan will be a snake at the side of the road, A poisonous snake beside the path, That strikes at the horse's heel, So that the rider is thrown off backward. 
01Gn 49:18 "I wait for your deliverance, LORD. 
01Gn 49:19 "Gad will be attacked by a band of robbers, But he will turn and pursue them. 
01Gn 49:20 "Asher's land will produce rich food. He will provide food fit for a king. 
01Gn 49:21 "Naphtali is a deer that runs free, Who bears lovely fawns. 
01Gn 49:22 "Joseph is like a wild donkey by a spring, A wild colt on a hillside. 
01Gn 49:23 His enemies attack him fiercely And pursue him with their bows and arrows. 
01Gn 49:24 But his bow remains steady, And his arms are made strong By the power of the Mighty God of Jacob, By the Shepherd, the Protector of Israel. 
01Gn 49:25 It is your father's God who helps you, The Almighty God who blesses you With blessings of rain from above And of deep waters from beneath the ground, Blessings of many cattle and children, 
01Gn 49:26 Blessings of grain and flowers, Blessings of ancient mountains, Delightful things from everlasting hills. May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph, On the brow of the one set apart from his brothers. 
01Gn 49:27 "Benjamin is like a vicious wolf. Morning and evening he kills and devours." 
01Gn 49:28 These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said as he spoke a suitable word of farewell to each son. 
01Gn 49:29 Then Jacob commanded his sons, "Now that I am going to join my people in death, bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
01Gn 49:30 at Machpelah east of Mamre in the land of Canaan. Abraham bought this cave and field from Ephron for a burial ground. 
01Gn 49:31 That is where they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah; that is where they buried Isaac and his wife Rebecca; and that is where I buried Leah. 
01Gn 49:32 The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites. Bury me there." 
01Gn 49:33 When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he lay back down and died. 
01Gn 50:1 Joseph threw himself on his father, crying and kissing his face. 
01Gn 50:2 Then Joseph gave orders to embalm his father's body. 
01Gn 50:3 It took forty days, the normal time for embalming. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. 
01Gn 50:4 When the time of mourning was over, Joseph said to the king's officials, "Please take this message to the king£º 
01Gn 50:5 'When my father was about to die, he made me promise him that I would bury him in the tomb which he had prepared in the land of Canaan. So please let me go and bury my father, and then I will come back.' " 
01Gn 50:6 The king answered, "Go and bury your father, as you promised you would." 
01Gn 50:7 So Joseph went to bury his father. All the king's officials, the senior men of his court, and all the leading men of Egypt went with Joseph. 
01Gn 50:8 His family, his brothers, and the rest of his father's family all went with him. Only their small children and their sheep, goats, and cattle stayed in the region of Goshen. 
01Gn 50:9 Men in chariots and men on horseback also went with him; it was a huge group. 
01Gn 50:10 When they came to the threshing place at Atad east of the Jordan, they mourned loudly for a long time, and Joseph performed mourning ceremonies for seven days. 
01Gn 50:11 When the citizens of Canaan saw those people mourning at Atad, they said, "What a solemn ceremony of mourning the Egyptians are holding!" That is why the place was named Abel Mizraim. 
01Gn 50:12 So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them; 
01Gn 50:13 they carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah east of Mamre in the field which Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial ground. 
01Gn 50:14 After Joseph had buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him for the funeral. 
01Gn 50:15 After the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said, "What if Joseph still hates us and plans to pay us back for all the harm we did to him?" 
01Gn 50:16 So they sent a message to Joseph£º "Before our father died, 
01Gn 50:17 he told us to ask you, 'Please forgive the crime your brothers committed when they wronged you.' Now please forgive us the wrong that we, the servants of your father's God, have done." Joseph cried when he received this message. 
01Gn 50:18 Then his brothers themselves came and bowed down before him. "Here we are before you as your slaves," they said. 
01Gn 50:19 But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid; I can't put myself in the place of God. 
01Gn 50:20 You plotted evil against me, but God turned it into good, in order to preserve the lives of many people who are alive today because of what happened. 
01Gn 50:21 You have nothing to fear. I will take care of you and your children." So he reassured them with kind words that touched their hearts. 
01Gn 50:22 Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father's family; he was a hundred and ten years old when he died. 
01Gn 50:23 He lived to see Ephraim's children and grandchildren. He also lived to receive the children of Machir son of Manasseh into the family. 
01Gn 50:24 He said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will certainly take care of you and lead you out of this land to the land he solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." 
01Gn 50:25 Then Joseph asked his people to make a vow. "Promise me," he said, "that when God leads you to that land, you will take my body with you." 
01Gn 50:26 So Joseph died in Egypt at the age of a hundred and ten. They embalmed his body and put it in a coffin. 
02
02Ex 1:1 The sons of Jacob who went to Egypt with him, each with his family, were 
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
02Ex 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
02Ex 1:4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
02Ex 1:5 The total number of these people directly descended from Jacob was seventy. His son Joseph was already in Egypt. 
02Ex 1:6 In the course of time Joseph, his brothers, and all the rest of that generation died, 
02Ex 1:7 but their descendants, the Israelites, had many children and became so numerous and strong that Egypt was filled with them. 
02Ex 1:8 Then, a new king, who knew nothing about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 
02Ex 1:9 He said to his people, "These Israelites are so numerous and strong that they are a threat to us. 
02Ex 1:10 In case of war they might join our enemies in order to fight against us, and might escape from the country. We must find some way to keep them from becoming even more numerous." 
02Ex 1:11 So the Egyptians put slave drivers over them to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses to serve as supply centers for the king. 
02Ex 1:12 But the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they increased in number and the farther they spread through the land. The Egyptians came to fear the Israelites 
02Ex 1:13 and made their lives miserable by forcing them into cruel slavery.
02Ex 1:14 They made them work on their building projects and in their fields, and they had no pity on them.
02Ex 1:15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and Puah, the two midwives who helped the Hebrew women. 
02Ex 1:16 "When you help the Hebrew women give birth," he said to them, "kill the baby if it is a boy; but if it is a girl, let it live." 
02Ex 1:17 But the midwives were God-fearing and so did not obey the king; instead, they let the boys live. 
02Ex 1:18 So the king sent for the midwives and asked them, "Why are you doing this? Why are you letting the boys live?" 
02Ex 1:19 They answered, "The Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they give birth easily, and their babies are born before either of us gets there." 
02Ex 1:20 Because the midwives were God-fearing, God was good to them and gave them families of their own.
02Ex 1:21 And the Israelites continued to increase and become strong.
02Ex 1:22 Finally the king issued a command to all his people£º "Take every newborn Hebrew boy and throw him into the Nile, but let all the girls live." 
02Ex 2:1 During this time a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman of his own tribe, 
02Ex 2:2 and she bore him a son. When she saw what a fine baby he was, she hid him for three months. 
02Ex 2:3 But when she could not hide him any longer, she took a basket made of reeds and covered it with tar to make it watertight. She put the baby in it and then placed it in the tall grass at the edge of the river. 
02Ex 2:4 The baby's sister stood some distance away to see what would happen to him. 
02Ex 2:5 The king's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her servants walked along the bank. Suddenly she noticed the basket in the tall grass and sent a slave woman to get it. 
02Ex 2:6 The princess opened it and saw a baby boy. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said. 
02Ex 2:7 Then his sister asked her, "Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?" 
02Ex 2:8 "Please do," she answered. So the girl went and brought the baby's own mother. 
02Ex 2:9 The princess told the woman, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So she took the baby and nursed him. 
02Ex 2:10 Later, when the child was old enough, she took him to the king's daughter, who adopted him as her own son. She said to herself, "I pulled him out of the water, and so I name him Moses." 
02Ex 2:11 When Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his people, the Hebrews, and he saw how they were forced to do hard labor. He even saw an Egyptian kill a Hebrew, one of Moses' own people. 
02Ex 2:12 Moses looked all around, and when he saw that no one was watching, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. 
02Ex 2:13 The next day he went back and saw two Hebrew men fighting. He said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you beating up a fellow Hebrew?" 
02Ex 2:14 The man answered, "Who made you our ruler and judge? Are you going to kill me just as you killed that Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and said to himself, "People have found out what I have done." 
02Ex 2:15 When the king heard about what had happened, he tried to have Moses killed,
02Ex 2:16 but Moses fled and went to live in the land of Midian. One day, when Moses was sitting by a well, seven daughters of Jethro, the priest of Midian, came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father's sheep and goats. 
02Ex 2:17 But some shepherds drove Jethro's daughters away. Then Moses went to their rescue and watered their animals for them. 
02Ex 2:18 When they returned to their father, he asked, "Why have you come back so early today?" 
02Ex 2:19 "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds," they answered, "and he even drew water for us and watered our animals." 
02Ex 2:20 "Where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave the man out there? Go and invite him to eat with us." 
02Ex 2:21 So Moses decided to live there, and Jethro gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage, 
02Ex 2:22 who bore him a son. Moses said to himself, "I am a foreigner in this land, and so I name him Gershom." 
02Ex 2:23 Years later the king of Egypt died, but the Israelites were still groaning under their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry went up to God, 
02Ex 2:24 who heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
02Ex 2:25 He saw the slavery of the Israelites and was concerned for them. 
02Ex 3:1 One day while Moses was taking care of the sheep and goats of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, he led the flock across the desert and came to Sinai, the holy mountain. 
02Ex 3:2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him as a flame coming from the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but that it was not burning up. 
02Ex 3:3 "This is strange," he thought. "Why isn't the bush burning up? I will go closer and see." 
02Ex 3:4 When the LORD saw that Moses was coming closer, he called to him from the middle of the bush and said, "Moses! Moses!" He answered, "Yes, here I am." 
02Ex 3:5 God said, "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground. 
02Ex 3:6 I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." So Moses covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God. 
02Ex 3:7 Then the LORD said, "I have seen how cruelly my people are being treated in Egypt; I have heard them cry out to be rescued from their slave drivers. I know all about their sufferings, 
02Ex 3:8 and so I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them out of Egypt to a spacious land, one which is rich and fertile and in which the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites now live. 
02Ex 3:9 I have indeed heard the cry of my people, and I see how the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
02Ex 3:10 Now I am sending you to the king of Egypt so that you can lead my people out of his country." 
02Ex 3:11 But Moses said to God, "I am nobody. How can I go to the king and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?" 
02Ex 3:12 God answered, "I will be with you, and when you bring the people out of Egypt, you will worship me on this mountain. That will be the proof that I have sent you." 
02Ex 3:13 But Moses replied, "When I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors sent me to you,' they will ask me, 'What is his name?' So what can I tell them?" 
02Ex 3:14 God said, "I am who I am. You must tell them£º 'The one who is called I AM has sent me to you.' 
02Ex 3:15 Tell the Israelites that I, the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, have sent you to them. This is my name forever; this is what all future generations are to call me. 
02Ex 3:16 Go and gather the leaders of Israel together and tell them that I, the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appeared to you. Tell them that I have come to them and have seen what the Egyptians are doing to them. 
02Ex 3:17 I have decided that I will bring them out of Egypt, where they are being treated cruelly, and will take them to a rich and fertile land - the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
02Ex 3:18 "My people will listen to what you say to them. Then you must go with the leaders of Israel to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has revealed himself to us. Now allow us to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD, our God.' 
02Ex 3:19 I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless he is forced to do so. 
02Ex 3:20 But I will use my power and will punish Egypt by doing terrifying things there. After that he will let you go. 
02Ex 3:21 "I will make the Egyptians respect you so that when my people leave, they will not go empty-handed. 
02Ex 3:22 Every Israelite woman will go to her Egyptian neighbors and to any Egyptian woman living in her house and will ask for clothing and for gold and silver jewelry. The Israelites will put these things on their sons and daughters and carry away the wealth of the Egyptians." 
02Ex 4:1 Then Moses answered the LORD, "But suppose the Israelites do not believe me and will not listen to what I say. What shall I do if they say that you did not appear to me?" 
02Ex 4:2 So the LORD asked him, "What are you holding?" "A walking stick," he answered. 
02Ex 4:3 The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." When Moses threw it down, it turned into a snake, and he ran away from it. 
02Ex 4:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Reach down and pick it up by the tail." So Moses reached down and caught it, and it became a walking stick again. 
02Ex 4:5 The LORD said, "Do this to prove to the Israelites that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to you." 
02Ex 4:6 The LORD spoke to Moses again, "Put your hand inside your robe." Moses obeyed; and when he took his hand out, it was diseased, covered with white spots, like snow. 
02Ex 4:7 Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your robe again." He did so, and when he took it out this time, it was healthy, just like the rest of his body. 
02Ex 4:8 The LORD said, "If they will not believe you or be convinced by the first miracle, then this one will convince them. 
02Ex 4:9 If in spite of these two miracles they still will not believe you, and if they refuse to listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the ground. The water will turn into blood." 
02Ex 4:10 But Moses said, "No, LORD, don't send me. I have never been a good speaker, and I haven't become one since you began to speak to me. I am a poor speaker, slow and hesitant." 
02Ex 4:11 The LORD said to him, "Who gives man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or dumb? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? It is I, the LORD. 
02Ex 4:12 Now, go! I will help you to speak, and I will tell you what to say." 
02Ex 4:13 But Moses answered, "No, Lord, please send someone else." 
02Ex 4:14 At this the LORD became angry with Moses and said, "What about your brother Aaron, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. In fact, he is now coming to meet you and will be glad to see you. 
02Ex 4:15 You can speak to him and tell him what to say. I will help both of you to speak, and I will tell you both what to do. 
02Ex 4:16 He will be your spokesman and speak to the people for you. Then you will be like God, telling him what to say. 
02Ex 4:17 Take this walking stick with you; for with it you will perform miracles." 
02Ex 4:18 Then Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please let me go back to my relatives in Egypt to see if they are still alive." Jethro agreed and told him good-bye. 
02Ex 4:19 While Moses was still in Midian, the LORD said to him, "Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead." 
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and set out with them for Egypt, carrying the walking stick that God had told him to take. 
02Ex 4:21 Again the LORD said to Moses, "Now that you are going back to Egypt, be sure to perform before the king all the miracles which I have given you the power to do. But I will make the king stubborn, and he will not let the people go. 
02Ex 4:22 Then you must tell him that I, the LORD, say, 'Israel is my first-born son. 
02Ex 4:23 I told you to let my son go, so that he might worship me, but you refused. Now I am going to kill your first-born son.' " 
02Ex 4:24 At a camping place on the way to Egypt, the LORD met Moses and tried to kill him. 
02Ex 4:25 Then Zipporah, his wife, took a sharp stone, cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched Moses' feet with it.
02Ex 4:26 Because of the rite of circumcision she said to Moses, "You are a husband of blood to me." And so the LORD spared Moses' life.
02Ex 4:27 Meanwhile the LORD had said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he went to meet him at the holy mountain; and when he met him, he kissed him. 
02Ex 4:28 Then Moses told Aaron everything that the LORD had said when he told him to return to Egypt; he also told him about the miracles which the LORD had ordered him to perform. 
02Ex 4:29 So Moses and Aaron went to Egypt and gathered all the Israelite leaders together. 
02Ex 4:30 Aaron told them everything that the LORD had said to Moses, and then Moses performed all the miracles in front of the people. 
02Ex 4:31 They believed, and when they heard that the LORD had come to them and had seen how they were being treated cruelly, they bowed down and worshiped. 
02Ex 5:1 Then Moses and Aaron went to the king of Egypt and said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go, so that they can hold a festival in the desert to honor me.' " 
02Ex 5:2 "Who is the LORD?" the king demanded. "Why should I listen to him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD; and I will not let Israel go." 
02Ex 5:3 Moses and Aaron replied, "The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us. Allow us to travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. If we don't do so, he will kill us with disease or by war." 
02Ex 5:4 The king said to Moses and Aaron, "What do you mean by making the people neglect their work? Get those slaves back to work! 
02Ex 5:5 You people have become more numerous than the Egyptians. And now you want to stop working!" 
02Ex 5:6 That same day the king commanded the Egyptian slave drivers and the Israelite foremen£º 
02Ex 5:7 "Stop giving the people straw for making bricks. Make them go and find it for themselves. 
02Ex 5:8 But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before, not one brick less. They don't have enough work to do, and that is why they keep asking me to let them go and offer sacrifices to their God! 
02Ex 5:9 Make them work harder and keep them busy, so that they won't have time to listen to a pack of lies." 
02Ex 5:10 The slave drivers and the Israelite foremen went out and said to the Israelites, "The king has said that he will not supply you with any more straw. 
02Ex 5:11 He says that you must go and get it for yourselves wherever you can find it, but you must still make the same number of bricks." 
02Ex 5:12 So the people went all over Egypt looking for straw. 
02Ex 5:13 The slave drivers kept trying to force them to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made when they were given straw. 
02Ex 5:14 The Egyptian slave drivers beat the Israelite foremen, whom they had put in charge of the work. They demanded, "Why aren't you people making the same number of bricks that you made before?" 
02Ex 5:15 Then the foremen went to the king and complained, "Why do you do this to us, Your Majesty? 
02Ex 5:16 We are given no straw, but we are still ordered to make bricks! And now we are being beaten. It is your people that are at fault." 
02Ex 5:17 The king answered, "You are lazy and don't want to work, and that is why you ask me to let you go and offer sacrifices to the LORD. 
02Ex 5:18 Now get back to work! You will not be given any straw, but you must still make the same number of bricks." 
02Ex 5:19 The foremen realized that they were in trouble when they were told that they had to make the same number of bricks every day as they had made before. 
02Ex 5:20 As they were leaving, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. 
02Ex 5:21 They said to Moses and Aaron, "The LORD has seen what you have done and will punish you for making the king and his officers hate us. You have given them an excuse to kill us." 
02Ex 5:22 Then Moses turned to the LORD again and said, "Lord, why do you mistreat your people? Why did you send me here? 
02Ex 5:23 Ever since I went to the king to speak for you, he has treated them cruelly. And you have done nothing to help them!" 
02Ex 6:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you are going to see what I will do to the king. I will force him to let my people go. In fact, I will force him to drive them out of his land." 
02Ex 6:2 God spoke to Moses and said, "I am the LORD. 
02Ex 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Almighty God, but I did not make myself known to them by my holy name, the LORD. 
02Ex 6:4 I also made my covenant with them, promising to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they had lived as foreigners. 
02Ex 6:5 Now I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered my covenant. 
02Ex 6:6 So tell the Israelites that I say to them, 'I am the LORD; I will rescue you and set you free from your slavery to the Egyptians. I will raise my mighty arm to bring terrible punishment upon them, and I will save you. 
02Ex 6:7 I will make you my own people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the LORD your God when I set you free from slavery in Egypt. 
02Ex 6:8 I will bring you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as your own possession. I am the LORD.' " 
02Ex 6:9 Moses told this to the Israelites, but they would not listen to him, because their spirit had been broken by their cruel slavery. 
02Ex 6:10 Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 6:11 "Go and tell the king of Egypt that he must let the Israelites leave his land." 
02Ex 6:12 But Moses replied, "Even the Israelites will not listen to me, so why should the king? I am such a poor speaker." 
02Ex 6:13 The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron£º "Tell the Israelites and the king of Egypt that I have ordered you to lead the Israelites out of Egypt." 
02Ex 6:14 Reuben, Jacob's first-born, had four sons£º Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. 
02Ex 6:15 Simeon had six sons£º Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. 
02Ex 6:16 Levi had three sons£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; they were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. Levi lived 137 years. 
02Ex 6:17 Gershon had two sons£º Libni and Shimei, and they had many descendants. 
02Ex 6:18 Kohath had four sons£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years. 
02Ex 6:19 Merari had two sons£º Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi with their descendants. 
02Ex 6:20 Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years. 
02Ex 6:21 Izhar had three sons£º Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
02Ex 6:22 Uzziel also had three sons£º Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 
02Ex 6:23 Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon; she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
02Ex 6:24 Korah had three sons£º Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; they were the ancestors of the divisions of the clan of Korah. 
02Ex 6:25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters, who bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the families and the clans of the tribe of Levi. 
02Ex 6:26 Aaron and Moses were the ones to whom the LORD said, "Lead the tribes of Israel out of Egypt." 
02Ex 6:27 They were the men who told the king of Egypt to free the Israelites. 
02Ex 6:28 When the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
02Ex 6:29 he said, "I am the LORD. Tell the king of Egypt everything I tell you." 
02Ex 6:30 But Moses answered, "You know that I am such a poor speaker; why should the king listen to me?" 
02Ex 7:1 The LORD said, "I am going to make you like God to the king, and your brother Aaron will speak to him as your prophet. 
02Ex 7:2 Tell Aaron everything I command you, and he will tell the king to let the Israelites leave his country. 
02Ex 7:3 But I will make the king stubborn, and he will not listen to you, no matter how many terrifying things I do in Egypt.
02Ex 7:4 Then I will bring severe punishment on Egypt and lead the tribes of my people out of the land.
02Ex 7:5 The Egyptians will then know that I am the LORD, when I raise my hand against them and bring the Israelites out of their country." 
02Ex 7:6 Moses and Aaron did what the LORD commanded. 
02Ex 7:7 At the time when they spoke to the king, Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three. 
02Ex 7:8 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
02Ex 7:9 "If the king demands that you prove yourselves by performing a miracle, tell Aaron to take his walking stick and throw it down in front of the king, and it will turn into a snake." 
02Ex 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went to the king and did as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his walking stick down in front of the king and his officers, and it turned into a snake. 
02Ex 7:11 Then the king called for his wise men and magicians, and by their magic they did the same thing. 
02Ex 7:12 They threw down their walking sticks, and the sticks turned into snakes. But Aaron's stick swallowed theirs. 
02Ex 7:13 The king, however, remained stubborn and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The king is very stubborn and refuses to let the people go. 
02Ex 7:15 So go and meet him in the morning when he goes down to the Nile. Take with you the walking stick that was turned into a snake, and wait for him on the riverbank. 
02Ex 7:16 Then say to the king, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to tell you to let his people go, so that they can worship him in the desert. But until now you have not listened. 
02Ex 7:17 Now, Your Majesty, the LORD says that you will find out who he is by what he is going to do. Look, I am going to strike the surface of the river with this stick, and the water will be turned into blood. 
02Ex 7:18 The fish will die, and the river will stink so much that the Egyptians will not be able to drink from it.' " 
02Ex 7:19 The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to take his stick and hold it out over all the rivers, canals, and pools in Egypt. The water will become blood, and all over the land there will be blood, even in the wooden tubs and stone jars." 
02Ex 7:20 Then Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the presence of the king and his officers, Aaron raised his stick and struck the surface of the river, and all the water in it was turned into blood. 
02Ex 7:21 The fish in the river died, and it smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink from it. There was blood everywhere in Egypt. 
02Ex 7:22 Then the king's magicians did the same thing by means of their magic, and the king was as stubborn as ever. Just as the LORD had said, the king refused to listen to Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 7:23 Instead, he turned and went back to his palace without paying any attention even to this. 
02Ex 7:24 All the Egyptians dug along the bank of the river for drinking water, because they were not able to drink water from the river. 
02Ex 7:25 Seven days passed after the LORD struck the river. 
02Ex 8:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the king and tell him that the LORD says, 'Let my people go, so that they can worship me. 
02Ex 8:2 If you refuse, I will punish your country by covering it with frogs. 
02Ex 8:3 The Nile will be so full of frogs that they will leave it and go into your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your officials and your people, and even into your ovens and baking pans. 
02Ex 8:4 They will jump up on you, your people, and all your officials.' " 
02Ex 8:5 The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to hold out his walking stick over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up and cover the land of Egypt." 
02Ex 8:6 So Aaron held it out over all the water, and the frogs came out and covered the land. 
02Ex 8:7 But the magicians used magic, and they also made frogs come up on the land. 
02Ex 8:8 The king called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take away these frogs, and I will let your people go, so that they can offer sacrifices to the LORD." 
02Ex 8:9 Moses replied, "I will be glad to pray for you. Just set the time when I am to pray for you, your officers, and your people. Then you will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile." 
02Ex 8:10 The king answered, "Pray for me tomorrow." Moses said, "I will do as you ask, and then you will know that there is no other god like the LORD, our God. 
02Ex 8:11 You, your officials, and your people will be rid of the frogs, and there will be none left except in the Nile." 
02Ex 8:12 Then Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed to the LORD to take away the frogs which he had brought on the king. 
02Ex 8:13 The LORD did as Moses asked, and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died. 
02Ex 8:14 The Egyptians piled them up in great heaps, until the land stank with them. 
02Ex 8:15 When the king saw that the frogs were dead, he became stubborn again and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 8:16 The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron to strike the ground with his stick, and all over the land of Egypt the dust will change into gnats." 
02Ex 8:17 So Aaron struck the ground with his stick, and all the dust in Egypt was turned into gnats, which covered the people and the animals. 
02Ex 8:18 The magicians tried to use their magic to make gnats appear, but they failed. There were gnats everywhere, 
02Ex 8:19 and the magicians said to the king, "God has done this!" But the king was stubborn and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 8:20 The LORD said to Moses, "Early tomorrow morning go and meet the king as he goes to the river, and tell him that the LORD says, 'Let my people go, so that they can worship me. 
02Ex 8:21 I warn you that if you refuse, I will punish you by sending flies on you, your officials, and your people. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and the ground will be covered with them. 
02Ex 8:22 But I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live, so that there will be no flies there. I will do this so that you will know that I, the LORD, am at work in this land. 
02Ex 8:23 I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miracle will take place tomorrow.' " 
02Ex 8:24 The LORD sent great swarms of flies into the king's palace and the houses of his officials. The whole land of Egypt was brought to ruin by the flies. 
02Ex 8:25 Then the king called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Go and offer sacrifices to your God here in this country." 
02Ex 8:26 "It would not be right to do that," Moses answered, "because the Egyptians would be offended by our sacrificing the animals that we offer to the LORD our God. If we use these animals and offend the Egyptians by sacrificing them where they can see us, they will stone us to death. 
02Ex 8:27 We must travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, just as he commanded us." 
02Ex 8:28 The king said, "I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD, your God, in the desert, if you do not go very far. Pray for me." 
02Ex 8:29 Moses answered, "As soon as I leave, I will pray to the LORD that tomorrow the flies will leave you, your officials, and your people. But you must not deceive us again and prevent the people from going to sacrifice to the LORD." 
02Ex 8:30 Moses left the king and prayed to the LORD, 
02Ex 8:31 and the LORD did as Moses asked. The flies left the king, his officials, and his people; not one fly remained. 
02Ex 8:32 But even this time the king became stubborn, and again he would not let the people go. 
02Ex 9:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Go to the king and tell him that the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, 'Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
02Ex 9:2 If you again refuse to let them go, 
02Ex 9:3 I will punish you by sending a terrible disease on all your animals - your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats. 
02Ex 9:4 I will make a distinction between the animals of the Israelites and those of the Egyptians, and no animal that belongs to the Israelites will die. 
02Ex 9:5 I, the LORD, have set tomorrow as the time when I will do this.' " 
02Ex 9:6 The next day the LORD did as he had said, and all the animals of the Egyptians died, but not one of the animals of the Israelites died. 
02Ex 9:7 The king asked what had happened and was told that none of the animals of the Israelites had died. But he was stubborn and would not let the people go. 
02Ex 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take a few handfuls of ashes from a furnace; Moses is to throw them into the air in front of the king. 
02Ex 9:9 They will spread out like fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and everywhere they will produce boils that become open sores on the people and the animals." 
02Ex 9:10 So they got some ashes and stood before the king; Moses threw them into the air, and they produced boils that became open sores on the people and the animals. 
02Ex 9:11 The magicians were not able to appear before Moses, because they were covered with boils, like all the other Egyptians. 
02Ex 9:12 But the LORD made the king stubborn and, just as the LORD had said, the king would not listen to Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 9:13 The LORD then said to Moses, "Early tomorrow morning meet with the king and tell him that the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, 'Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
02Ex 9:14 This time I will punish not only your officials and your people, but I will punish you as well, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the world. 
02Ex 9:15 If I had raised my hand to strike you and your people with disease, you would have been completely destroyed. 
02Ex 9:16 But to show you my power I have let you live so that my fame might spread over the whole world. 
02Ex 9:17 Yet you are still arrogant and refuse to let my people go. 
02Ex 9:18 This time tomorrow I will cause a heavy hailstorm, such as Egypt has never known in all its history. 
02Ex 9:19 Now give orders for your livestock and everything else you have in the open to be put under shelter. Hail will fall on the people and animals left outside unprotected, and they will all die.' " 
02Ex 9:20 Some of the king's officials were afraid because of what the LORD had said, and they brought their slaves and animals indoors for shelter. 
02Ex 9:21 Others, however, paid no attention to the LORD's warning and left their slaves and animals out in the open. 
02Ex 9:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Raise your hand toward the sky, and hail will fall over the whole land of Egypt - on the people, the animals, and all the plants in the fields." 
02Ex 9:23 So Moses raised his stick toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the ground. The LORD sent 
02Ex 9:24 a heavy hailstorm, with lightning flashing back and forth. It was the worst storm that Egypt had ever known in all its history. 
02Ex 9:25 All over Egypt the hail struck down everything in the open, including all the people and all the animals. It beat down all the plants in the fields and broke all the trees. 
02Ex 9:26 The region of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was the only place where there was no hail. 
02Ex 9:27 The king sent for Moses and Aaron and said, "This time I have sinned; the LORD is in the right, and my people and I are in the wrong. 
02Ex 9:28 Pray to the LORD! We have had enough of this thunder and hail! I promise to let you go; you don't have to stay here any longer." 
02Ex 9:29 Moses said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will lift up my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the LORD. 
02Ex 9:30 But I know that you and your officials do not yet fear the LORD God." 
02Ex 9:31 The flax and the barley were ruined, because the barley was ripe, and the flax was budding. 
02Ex 9:32 But none of the wheat was ruined, because it ripens later. 
02Ex 9:33 Moses left the king, went out of the city, and lifted up his hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder, the hail, and the rain all stopped. 
02Ex 9:34 When the king saw what had happened, he sinned again. He and his officials remained as stubborn as ever 
02Ex 9:35 and, just as the LORD had foretold through Moses, the king would not let the Israelites go. 
02Ex 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go and see the king. I have made him and his officials stubborn, in order that I may perform these miracles among them 
02Ex 10:2 and in order that you may be able to tell your children and grandchildren how I made fools of the Egyptians when I performed the miracles. All of you will know that I am the LORD." 
02Ex 10:3 So Moses and Aaron went to the king and said to him, "The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, 'How much longer will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
02Ex 10:4 If you keep on refusing, then I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 
02Ex 10:5 There will be so many that they will completely cover the ground. They will eat everything that the hail did not destroy, even the trees that are left. 
02Ex 10:6 They will fill your palaces and the houses of all your officials and all your people. They will be worse than anything your ancestors ever saw.' " Then Moses turned and left. 
02Ex 10:7 The king's officials said to him, "How long is this man going to give us trouble? Let the Israelite men go, so that they can worship the LORD their God. Don't you realize that Egypt is ruined?" 
02Ex 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king, and he said to them, "You may go and worship the LORD your God. But exactly who will go?" 
02Ex 10:9 Moses answered, "We will all go, including our children and our old people. We will take our sons and daughters, our sheep and goats, and our cattle, because we must hold a festival to honor the LORD." 
02Ex 10:10 The king said, "I swear by the LORD that I will never let you take your women and children! It is clear that you are plotting to revolt. 
02Ex 10:11 No! Only the men may go and worship the LORD if that is what you want." With that, Moses and Aaron were driven out of the king's presence. 
02Ex 10:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Raise your hand over the land of Egypt to bring the locusts. They will come and eat everything that grows, everything that has survived the hail." 
02Ex 10:13 So Moses raised his stick, and the LORD caused a wind from the east to blow on the land all that day and all that night. By morning it had brought the locusts. 
02Ex 10:14 They came in swarms and settled over the whole country. It was the largest swarm of locusts that had ever been seen or that ever would be seen again. 
02Ex 10:15 They covered the ground until it was black with them; they ate everything that the hail had left, including all the fruit on the trees. Not a green thing was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 10:16 Then the king hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. 
02Ex 10:17 Now forgive my sin this one time and pray to the LORD your God to take away this fatal punishment from me." 
02Ex 10:18 Moses left the king and prayed to the LORD. 
02Ex 10:19 And the LORD changed the east wind into a very strong west wind, which picked up the locusts and blew them into the Gulf of Suez. Not one locust was left in all of Egypt. 
02Ex 10:20 But the LORD made the king stubborn, and he did not let the Israelites go. 
02Ex 10:21 The LORD then said to Moses, "Raise your hand toward the sky, and a darkness thick enough to be felt will cover the land of Egypt." 
02Ex 10:22 Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and there was total darkness throughout Egypt for three days. 
02Ex 10:23 The Egyptians could not see each other, and no one left his house during that time. But the Israelites had light where they were living. 
02Ex 10:24 The king called Moses and said, "You may go and worship the LORD; even your women and children may go with you. But your sheep, goats, and cattle must stay here." 
02Ex 10:25 Moses answered, "Then you would have to provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to the LORD our God. 
02Ex 10:26 No, we will take our animals with us; not one will be left behind. We ourselves must select the animals with which to worship the LORD our God. And until we get there, we will not know what animals to sacrifice to him." 
02Ex 10:27 The LORD made the king stubborn, and he would not let them go. 
02Ex 10:28 He said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Don't let me ever see you again! On the day I do, you will die!" 
02Ex 10:29 "You are right," Moses answered. "You will never see me again." 
02Ex 11:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will send only one more punishment on the king of Egypt and his people. After that he will let you leave. In fact, he will drive all of you out of here. 
02Ex 11:2 Now speak to the people of Israel and tell all of them to ask their neighbors for gold and silver jewelry." 
02Ex 11:3 The LORD made the Egyptians respect the Israelites. Indeed, the officials and all the people considered Moses to be a very great man. 
02Ex 11:4 Moses then said to the king, "The LORD says, 'At about midnight I will go through Egypt, 
02Ex 11:5 and every first-born son in Egypt will die, from the king's son, who is heir to the throne, to the son of the slave woman who grinds grain. The first-born of all the cattle will die also. 
02Ex 11:6 There will be loud crying all over Egypt, such as there has never been before or ever will be again. 
02Ex 11:7 But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites or their animals. Then you will know that I, the LORD, make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.' " 
02Ex 11:8 Moses concluded by saying, "All your officials will come to me and bow down before me, and they will beg me to take all my people and go away. After that, I will leave." Then in great anger Moses left the king. 
02Ex 11:9 The LORD had said to Moses, "The king will continue to refuse to listen to you, in order that I may do more of my miracles in Egypt." 
02Ex 11:10 Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before the king, but the LORD made him stubborn, and he would not let the Israelites leave his country. 
02Ex 12:1 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in Egypt£º 
02Ex 12:2 "This month is to be the first month of the year for you. 
02Ex 12:3 Give these instructions to the whole community of Israel£º On the tenth day of this month each man must choose either a lamb or a young goat for his household. 
02Ex 12:4 If his family is too small to eat a whole animal, he and his next-door neighbor may share an animal, in proportion to the number of people and the amount that each person can eat. 
02Ex 12:5 You may choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a one-year-old male without any defects. 
02Ex 12:6 Then, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, the whole community of Israel will kill the animals. 
02Ex 12:7 The people are to take some of the blood and put it on the doorposts and above the doors of the houses in which the animals are to be eaten. 
02Ex 12:8 That night the meat is to be roasted, and eaten with bitter herbs and with bread made without yeast. 
02Ex 12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, but eat it roasted whole, including the head, the legs, and the internal organs. 
02Ex 12:10 You must not leave any of it until morning; if any is left over, it must be burned. 
02Ex 12:11 You are to eat it quickly, for you are to be dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. It is the Passover Festival to honor me, the LORD. 
02Ex 12:12 "On that night I will go through the land of Egypt, killing every first-born male, both human and animal, and punishing all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. 
02Ex 12:13 The blood on the doorposts will be a sign to mark the houses in which you live. When I see the blood, I will pass over you and will not harm you when I punish the Egyptians. 
02Ex 12:14 You must celebrate this day as a religious festival to remind you of what I, the LORD, have done. Celebrate it for all time to come." 
02Ex 12:15 The LORD said, "For seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast - eat only unleavened bread. On the first day you are to get rid of all the yeast in your houses, for if anyone during those seven days eats bread made with yeast, he shall no longer be considered one of my people. 
02Ex 12:16 On the first day and again on the seventh day you are to meet for worship. No work is to be done on those days, but you may prepare food. 
02Ex 12:17 Keep this festival, because it was on this day that I brought your tribes out of Egypt. For all time to come you must celebrate this day as a festival. 
02Ex 12:18 From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month to the evening of the twenty-first day, you must not eat any bread made with yeast. 
02Ex 12:19 For seven days no yeast must be found in your houses,
02Ex 12:20 for if anyone, native-born or foreign, eats bread made with yeast, he shall no longer be considered one of my people." 
02Ex 12:21 Moses called for all the leaders of Israel and said to them, "Each of you is to choose a lamb or a young goat and kill it, so that your families can celebrate Passover. 
02Ex 12:22 Take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the bowl containing the animal's blood, and wipe the blood on the doorposts and the beam above the door of your house. Not one of you is to leave the house until morning. 
02Ex 12:23 When the LORD goes through Egypt to kill the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the beams and the doorposts and will not let the Angel of Death enter your houses and kill you. 
02Ex 12:24 You and your children must obey these rules forever. 
02Ex 12:25 When you enter the land that the LORD has promised to give you, you must perform this ritual. 
02Ex 12:26 When your children ask you, 'What does this ritual mean?' 
02Ex 12:27 you will answer, 'It is the sacrifice of Passover to honor the LORD, because he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt. He killed the Egyptians, but spared us.' " The Israelites knelt down and worshiped. 
02Ex 12:28 Then they went and did what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 12:29 At midnight the LORD killed all the first-born sons in Egypt, from the king's son, who was heir to the throne, to the son of the prisoner in the dungeon; all the first-born of the animals were also killed. 
02Ex 12:30 That night, the king, his officials, and all the other Egyptians were awakened. There was loud crying throughout Egypt, because there was not one home in which there was not a dead son. 
02Ex 12:31 That same night the king sent for Moses and Aaron and said, "Get out, you and your Israelites! Leave my country; go and worship the LORD, as you asked. 
02Ex 12:32 Take your sheep, goats, and cattle, and leave. Also pray for a blessing on me." 
02Ex 12:33 The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country; they said, "We will all be dead if you don't leave." 
02Ex 12:34 So the people filled their baking pans with unleavened dough, wrapped them in clothing, and carried them on their shoulders. 
02Ex 12:35 The Israelites had done as Moses had said, and had asked the Egyptians for gold and silver jewelry and for clothes. 
02Ex 12:36 The LORD made the Egyptians respect the people and give them what they asked for. In this way the Israelites carried away the wealth of the Egyptians. 
02Ex 12:37 The Israelites set out on foot from Rameses for Sukkoth. There were about 600,000 men, not counting women and children. 
02Ex 12:38 A large number of other people and many sheep, goats, and cattle also went with them. 
02Ex 12:39 They baked unleavened bread from the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for they had been driven out of Egypt so suddenly that they did not have time to get their food ready or to prepare leavened dough. 
02Ex 12:40 The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years. 
02Ex 12:41 On the day the 430 years ended, all the tribes of the LORD's people left Egypt. 
02Ex 12:42 It was a night when the LORD kept watch to bring them out of Egypt; this same night is dedicated to the LORD for all time to come as a night when the Israelites must keep watch. 
02Ex 12:43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the Passover regulations£º No foreigner shall eat the Passover meal, 
02Ex 12:44 but any slave that you have bought may eat it if you circumcise him first. 
02Ex 12:45 No temporary resident or hired worker may eat it. 
02Ex 12:46 The whole meal must be eaten in the house in which it was prepared; it must not be taken outside. And do not break any of the animal's bones. 
02Ex 12:47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate this festival, 
02Ex 12:48 but no uncircumcised man may eat it. If a foreigner has settled among you and wants to celebrate Passover to honor the LORD, you must first circumcise all the males of his household. He is then to be treated like a native-born Israelite and may join in the festival. 
02Ex 12:49 The same regulations apply to native-born Israelites and to foreigners who settle among you." 
02Ex 12:50 All the Israelites obeyed and did what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 12:51 On that day the LORD brought the Israelite tribes out of Egypt. 
02Ex 13:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 13:2 "Dedicate all the first-born males to me, for every first-born male Israelite and every first-born male animal belongs to me." 
02Ex 13:3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day - the day on which you left Egypt, the place where you were slaves. This is the day the LORD brought you out by his great power. No leavened bread is to be eaten. 
02Ex 13:4 You are leaving Egypt on this day in the first month, the month of Abib. 
02Ex 13:5 The LORD solemnly promised your ancestors to give you the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. When he brings you into that rich and fertile land, you must celebrate this festival in the first month of every year. 
02Ex 13:6 For seven days you must eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to honor the LORD. 
02Ex 13:7 For seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast; there must be no yeast or leavened bread anywhere in your land. 
02Ex 13:8 When the festival begins, explain to your sons that you do all this because of what the LORD did for you when you left Egypt. 
02Ex 13:9 This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on your hand or on your forehead; it will remind you to continue to recite and study the Law of the LORD, because the LORD brought you out of Egypt by his great power. 
02Ex 13:10 Celebrate this festival at the appointed time each year. 
02Ex 13:11 "The LORD will bring you into the land of the Canaanites, which he solemnly promised to you and your ancestors. When he gives it to you, 
02Ex 13:12 you must offer every first-born male to the LORD. Every first-born male of your animals belongs to the LORD, 
02Ex 13:13 but you must buy back from him every first-born male donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not want to buy back the donkey, break its neck. You must buy back every first-born male child of yours. 
02Ex 13:14 In the future, when your son asks what this observance means, you will answer him, 'By using great power the LORD brought us out of Egypt, the place where we were slaves. 
02Ex 13:15 When the king of Egypt was stubborn and refused to let us go, the LORD killed every first-born male in the land of Egypt, both human and animal. That is why we sacrifice every first-born male animal to the LORD, but buy back our first-born sons. 
02Ex 13:16 This observance will be a reminder, like something tied on our hands or on our foreheads; it will remind us that the LORD brought us out of Egypt by his great power.' " 
02Ex 13:17 When the king of Egypt let the people go, God did not take them by the road that goes up the coast to Philistia, although it was the shortest way. God thought, "I do not want the people to change their minds and return to Egypt when they see that they are going to have to fight." 
02Ex 13:18 Instead, he led them in a roundabout way through the desert toward the Red Sea. The Israelites were armed for battle. 
02Ex 13:19 Moses took the body of Joseph with him, as Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly promise to do. Joseph had said, "When God rescues you, you must carry my body with you from this place." 
02Ex 13:20 The Israelites left Sukkoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
02Ex 13:21 During the day the LORD went in front of them in a pillar of cloud to show them the way, and during the night he went in front of them in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel night and day. 
02Ex 13:22 The pillar of cloud was always in front of the people during the day, and the pillar of fire at night. 
02Ex 14:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 14:2 "Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, near Baal Zephon. 
02Ex 14:3 The king will think that the Israelites are wandering around in the country and are closed in by the desert. 
02Ex 14:4 I will make him stubborn, and he will pursue you, and my victory over the king and his army will bring me honor. Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." The Israelites did as they were told. 
02Ex 14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped, he and his officials changed their minds and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites escape, and we have lost them as our slaves!" 
02Ex 14:6 The king got his war chariot and his army ready. 
02Ex 14:7 He set out with all his chariots, including the six hundred finest, commanded by their officers. 
02Ex 14:8 The LORD made the king stubborn, and he pursued the Israelites, who were leaving triumphantly. 
02Ex 14:9 The Egyptian army, with all the horses, chariots, and drivers, pursued them and caught up with them where they were camped by the Red Sea near Pi Hahiroth and Baal Zephon. 
02Ex 14:10 When the Israelites saw the king and his army marching against them, they were terrified and cried out to the LORD for help. 
02Ex 14:11 They said to Moses, "Weren't there any graves in Egypt? Did you have to bring us out here in the desert to die? Look what you have done by bringing us out of Egypt! 
02Ex 14:12 Didn't we tell you before we left that this would happen? We told you to leave us alone and let us go on being slaves of the Egyptians. It would be better to be slaves there than to die here in the desert." 
02Ex 14:13 Moses answered, "Don't be afraid! Stand your ground, and you will see what the LORD will do to save you today; you will never see these Egyptians again. 
02Ex 14:14 The LORD will fight for you, and all you have to do is keep still." 
02Ex 14:15 The LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out for help? Tell the people to move forward. 
02Ex 14:16 Lift up your walking stick and hold it out over the sea. The water will divide, and the Israelites will be able to walk through the sea on dry ground. 
02Ex 14:17 I will make the Egyptians so stubborn that they will go in after them, and I will gain honor by my victory over the king, his army, his chariots, and his drivers. 
02Ex 14:18 When I defeat them, the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." 
02Ex 14:19 The angel of God, who had been in front of the army of Israel, moved and went to the rear. The pillar of cloud also moved until it was 
02Ex 14:20 between the Egyptians and the Israelites. The cloud made it dark for the Egyptians, but gave light to the people of Israel, and so the armies could not come near each other all night. 
02Ex 14:21 Moses held out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind. It blew all night and turned the sea into dry land. The water was divided, 
02Ex 14:22 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides. 
02Ex 14:23 The Egyptians pursued them and went after them into the sea with all their horses, chariots, and drivers. 
02Ex 14:24 Just before dawn the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw them into a panic. 
02Ex 14:25 He made the wheels of their chariots get stuck, so that they moved with great difficulty. The Egyptians said, "The LORD is fighting for the Israelites against us. Let's get out of here!" 
02Ex 14:26 The LORD said to Moses, "Hold out your hand over the sea, and the water will come back over the Egyptians and their chariots and drivers." 
02Ex 14:27 So Moses held out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the water returned to its normal level. The Egyptians tried to escape from the water, but the LORD threw them into the sea. 
02Ex 14:28 The water returned and covered the chariots, the drivers, and all the Egyptian army that had followed the Israelites into the sea; not one of them was left. 
02Ex 14:29 But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on both sides. 
02Ex 14:30 On that day the LORD saved the people of Israel from the Egyptians, and the Israelites saw them lying dead on the seashore. 
02Ex 14:31 When the Israelites saw the great power with which the LORD had defeated the Egyptians, they stood in awe of the LORD; and they had faith in the LORD and in his servant Moses. 
02Ex 15:1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD£º "I will sing to the LORD, because he has won a glorious victory; he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea. 
02Ex 15:2 The LORD is my strong defender; he is the one who has saved me. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will sing about his greatness. 
02Ex 15:3 The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name. 
02Ex 15:4 "He threw Egypt's army and its chariots into the sea; the best of its officers were drowned in the Red Sea. 
02Ex 15:5 The deep sea covered them; they sank to the bottom like a stone. 
02Ex 15:6 "Your right hand, LORD, is awesome in power; it breaks the enemy in pieces. 
02Ex 15:7 In majestic triumph you overthrow your foes; your anger blazes out and burns them up like straw. 
02Ex 15:8 You blew on the sea and the water piled up high; it stood up straight like a wall; the deepest part of the sea became solid. 
02Ex 15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue them and catch them; I will divide their wealth and take all I want; I will draw my sword and take all they have.' 
02Ex 15:10 But one breath from you, LORD, and the Egyptians were drowned; they sank like lead in the terrible water. 
02Ex 15:11 " LORD, who among the gods is like you? Who is like you, wonderful in holiness? Who can work miracles and mighty acts like yours? 
02Ex 15:12 You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed our enemies. 
02Ex 15:13 Faithful to your promise, you led the people you had rescued; by your strength you guided them to your sacred land. 
02Ex 15:14 The nations have heard, and they tremble with fear; the Philistines are seized with terror. 
02Ex 15:15 The leaders of Edom are terrified; Moab's mighty men are trembling; the people of Canaan lose their courage. 
02Ex 15:16 Terror and dread fall upon them. They see your strength, O LORD, and stand helpless with fear until your people have marched past - the people you set free from slavery. 
02Ex 15:17 You bring them in and plant them on your mountain, the place that you, LORD, have chosen for your home, the Temple that you yourself have built. 
02Ex 15:18 You, LORD, will be king forever and ever." 
02Ex 15:19 The Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. But when the Egyptian chariots with their horses and drivers went into the sea, the LORD brought the water back, and it covered them. 
02Ex 15:20 The prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, took her tambourine, and all the women followed her, playing tambourines and dancing. 
02Ex 15:21 Miriam sang for them£º "Sing to the LORD, because he has won a glorious victory; he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea." 
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea into the desert of Shur. For three days they walked through the desert, but found no water. 
02Ex 15:23 Then they came to a place called Marah, but the water there was so bitter that they could not drink it. That is why it was named Marah. 
02Ex 15:24 The people complained to Moses and asked, "What are we going to drink?" 
02Ex 15:25 Moses prayed earnestly to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood, which he threw into the water; and the water became fit to drink. There the LORD gave them laws to live by, and there he also tested them. 
02Ex 15:26 He said, "If you will obey me completely by doing what I consider right and by keeping my commands, I will not punish you with any of the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians. I am the LORD, the one who heals you." 
02Ex 15:27 Next they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees; there they camped by the water. 
02Ex 16:1 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim, and on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt, they came to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. 
02Ex 16:2 There in the desert they all complained to Moses and Aaron 
02Ex 16:3 and said to them, "We wish that the LORD had killed us in Egypt. There we could at least sit down and eat meat and as much other food as we wanted. But you have brought us out into this desert to starve us all to death." 
02Ex 16:4 The LORD said to Moses, "Now I am going to cause food to rain down from the sky for all of you. The people must go out every day and gather enough for that day. In this way I can test them to find out if they will follow my instructions. 
02Ex 16:5 On the sixth day they are to bring in twice as much as usual and prepare it." 
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt. 
02Ex 16:7 In the morning you will see the dazzling light of the LORD's presence. He has heard your complaints against him - yes, against him, because we are only carrying out his instructions." 
02Ex 16:8 Then Moses said, "It is the LORD who will give you meat to eat in the evening and as much bread as you want in the morning, because he has heard how much you have complained against him. When you complain against us, you are really complaining against the LORD." 
02Ex 16:9 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell the whole community to come and stand before the LORD, because he has heard their complaints." 
02Ex 16:10 As Aaron spoke to the whole community, they turned toward the desert, and suddenly the dazzling light of the LORD appeared in a cloud. 
02Ex 16:11 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 16:12 "I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them that at twilight they will have meat to eat, and in the morning they will have all the bread they want. Then they will know that I, the LORD, am their God." 
02Ex 16:13 In the evening a large flock of quails flew in, enough to cover the camp, and in the morning there was dew all around the camp. 
02Ex 16:14 When the dew evaporated, there was something thin and flaky on the surface of the desert. It was as delicate as frost. 
02Ex 16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they didn't know what it was and asked each other, "What is it?" Moses said to them, "This is the food that the LORD has given you to eat. 
02Ex 16:16 The LORD has commanded that each of you is to gather as much of it as he needs, two quarts for each member of his household." 
02Ex 16:17 The Israelites did this, some gathering more, others less. 
02Ex 16:18 When they measured it, those who gathered much did not have too much, and those who gathered less did not have too little. Each had gathered just what he needed. 
02Ex 16:19 Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it for tomorrow." 
02Ex 16:20 But some of them did not listen to Moses and saved part of it. The next morning it was full of worms and smelled rotten, and Moses was angry with them. 
02Ex 16:21 Every morning each one gathered as much as he needed; and when the sun grew hot, what was left on the ground melted. 
02Ex 16:22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts for each person. All the leaders of the community came and told Moses about it, 
02Ex 16:23 and he said to them, "The LORD has commanded that tomorrow is a holy day of rest, dedicated to him. Bake today what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Whatever is left should be put aside and kept for tomorrow." 
02Ex 16:24 As Moses had commanded, they kept what was left until the next day; it did not spoil or get worms in it. 
02Ex 16:25 Moses said, "Eat this today, because today is the Sabbath, a day of rest dedicated to the LORD, and you will not find any food outside the camp. 
02Ex 16:26 You must gather food for six days, but on the seventh day, the day of rest, there will be none." 
02Ex 16:27 On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather food, but they did not find any. 
02Ex 16:28 Then the LORD said to Moses, "How much longer will you people refuse to obey my commands? 
02Ex 16:29 Remember that I, the LORD, have given you a day of rest, and that is why on the sixth day I will always give you enough food for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day and not leave his home." 
02Ex 16:30 So the people did no work on the seventh day. 
02Ex 16:31 The people of Israel called the food manna. It was like a small white seed, and tasted like thin cakes made with honey. 
02Ex 16:32 Moses said, "The LORD has commanded us to save some manna, to be kept for our descendants, so that they can see the food which he gave us to eat in the desert when he brought us out of Egypt." 
02Ex 16:33 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, put two quarts of manna in it, and place it in the LORD's presence to be kept for our descendants." 
02Ex 16:34 As the LORD had commanded Moses, Aaron put it in front of the Covenant Box, so that it could be kept. 
02Ex 16:35 The Israelites ate manna for the next forty years, until they reached the land of Canaan, where they settled. 
02Ex 16:36 (The standard dry measure then in use equaled twenty quarts.) 
02Ex 17:1 The whole Israelite community left the desert of Sin, moving from one place to another at the command of the LORD. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water there to drink. 
02Ex 17:2 They complained to Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses answered, "Why are you complaining? Why are you putting the LORD to the test?" 
02Ex 17:3 But the people were very thirsty and continued to complain to Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt? To kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?" 
02Ex 17:4 Moses prayed earnestly to the LORD and said, "What can I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me." 
02Ex 17:5 The LORD said to Moses, "Take some of the leaders of Israel with you, and go on ahead of the people. Take along the stick with which you struck the Nile. 
02Ex 17:6 I will stand before you on a rock at Mount Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." Moses did so in the presence of the leaders of Israel. 
02Ex 17:7 The place was named Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites complained and put the LORD to the test when they asked, "Is the LORD with us or not?" 
02Ex 17:8 The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
02Ex 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Pick out some men to go and fight the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on top of the hill holding the stick that God told me to carry." 
02Ex 17:10 Joshua did as Moses commanded him and went out to fight the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
02Ex 17:11 As long as Moses held up his arms, the Israelites won, but when he put his arms down, the Amalekites started winning. 
02Ex 17:12 When Moses' arms grew tired, Aaron and Hur brought a stone for him to sit on, while they stood beside him and held up his arms, holding them steady until the sun went down. 
02Ex 17:13 In this way Joshua totally defeated the Amalekites. 
02Ex 17:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write an account of this victory, so that it will be remembered. Tell Joshua that I will completely destroy the Amalekites." 
02Ex 17:15 Moses built an altar and named it "The LORD is my Banner." 
02Ex 17:16 He said, "Hold high the banner of the LORD! The LORD will continue to fight against the Amalekites forever!" 
02Ex 18:1 Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything that God had done for Moses and the people of Israel when he led them out of Egypt. 
02Ex 18:2 So he came to Moses, bringing with him Moses' wife Zipporah, who had been left behind, 
02Ex 18:3 and Gershom and Eliezer, her two sons. (Moses had said, "I have been a foreigner in a strange land"; so he had named one son Gershom. 
02Ex 18:4 He had also said, "The God of my father helped me and saved me from being killed by the king of Egypt"; so he had named the other son Eliezer. ) 
02Ex 18:5 Jethro came with Moses' wife and her two sons into the desert where Moses was camped at the holy mountain. 
02Ex 18:6 He had sent word to Moses that they were coming, 
02Ex 18:7 so Moses went out to meet him, bowed before him, and kissed him. They asked about each other's health and then went into Moses' tent. 
02Ex 18:8 Moses told Jethro everything that the LORD had done to the king and the people of Egypt in order to rescue the Israelites. He also told him about the hardships the people had faced on the way and how the LORD had saved them. 
02Ex 18:9 When Jethro heard all this, he was happy 
02Ex 18:10 and said, "Praise the LORD, who saved you from the king and the people of Egypt! Praise the LORD, who saved his people from slavery! 
02Ex 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods, because he did this when the Egyptians treated the Israelites with such contempt." 
02Ex 18:12 Then Jethro brought an offering to be burned whole and other sacrifices to be offered to God; and Aaron and all the leaders of Israel went with him to eat the sacred meal as an act of worship. 
02Ex 18:13 The next day Moses was settling disputes among the people, and he was kept busy from morning till night. 
02Ex 18:14 When Jethro saw everything that Moses had to do, he asked, "What is all this that you are doing for the people? Why are you doing this all alone, with people standing here from morning till night to consult you?" 
02Ex 18:15 Moses answered, "I must do this because the people come to me to learn God's will. 
02Ex 18:16 When two people have a dispute, they come to me, and I decide which one of them is right, and I tell them God's commands and laws." 
02Ex 18:17 Then Jethro said, "You are not doing this right. 
02Ex 18:18 You will wear yourself out and these people as well. This is too much for you to do alone. 
02Ex 18:19 Now let me give you some good advice, and God will be with you. It is right for you to represent the people before God and bring their disputes to him. 
02Ex 18:20 You should teach them God's commands and explain to them how they should live and what they should do. 
02Ex 18:21 But in addition, you should choose some capable men and appoint them as leaders of the people£º leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. They must be God-fearing men who can be trusted and who cannot be bribed. 
02Ex 18:22 Let them serve as judges for the people on a permanent basis. They can bring all the difficult cases to you, but they themselves can decide all the smaller disputes. That will make it easier for you, as they share your burden. 
02Ex 18:23 If you do this, as God commands, you will not wear yourself out, and all these people can go home with their disputes settled." 
02Ex 18:24 Moses took Jethro's advice 
02Ex 18:25 and chose capable men from among all the Israelites. He appointed them as leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
02Ex 18:26 They served as judges for the people on a permanent basis, bringing the difficult cases to Moses but deciding the smaller disputes themselves. 
02Ex 18:27 Then Moses said good-bye to Jethro, and Jethro went back home. 
02Ex 19:1 The people of Israel left Rephidim, and on the first day of the third month after they had left Egypt they came to the desert of Sinai.
02Ex 19:2 There they set up camp at the foot of Mount Sinai,
02Ex 19:3 and Moses went up the mountain to meet with God. The LORD called to him from the mountain and told him to say to the Israelites, Jacob's descendants£º 
02Ex 19:4 "You saw what I, the LORD, did to the Egyptians and how I carried you as an eagle carries her young on her wings, and brought you here to me. 
02Ex 19:5 Now, if you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be my own people. The whole earth is mine, but you will be my chosen people, 
02Ex 19:6 a people dedicated to me alone, and you will serve me as priests." 
02Ex 19:7 So Moses went down and called the leaders of the people together and told them everything that the LORD had commanded him. 
02Ex 19:8 Then all the people answered together, "We will do everything that the LORD has said," and Moses reported this to the LORD. 
02Ex 19:9 The LORD said to Moses, "I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will believe you from now on." Moses told the LORD what the people had answered, 
02Ex 19:10 and the LORD said to him, "Go to the people and tell them to spend today and tomorrow purifying themselves for worship. They must wash their clothes 
02Ex 19:11 and be ready the day after tomorrow. On that day I will come down on Mount Sinai, where all the people can see me. 
02Ex 19:12 Mark a boundary around the mountain that the people must not cross, and tell them not to go up the mountain or even get near it. If any of you set foot on it, you are to be put to death; 
02Ex 19:13 you must either be stoned or shot with arrows, without anyone touching you. This applies to both people and animals; they must be put to death. But when the trumpet is blown, then the people are to go up to the mountain." 
02Ex 19:14 Then Moses came down the mountain and told the people to get ready for worship. So they washed their clothes, 
02Ex 19:15 and Moses told them, "Be ready by the day after tomorrow and don't have sexual intercourse in the meantime." 
02Ex 19:16 On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud appeared on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast was heard. All the people in the camp trembled with fear. 
02Ex 19:17 Moses led them out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
02Ex 19:18 All of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD had come down on it in fire. The smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and all the people trembled violently. 
02Ex 19:19 The sound of the trumpet became louder and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him with thunder. 
02Ex 19:20 The LORD came down on the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. Moses went up 
02Ex 19:21 and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people not to cross the boundary to come and look at me; if they do, many of them will die. 
02Ex 19:22 Even the priests who come near me must purify themselves, or I will punish them." 
02Ex 19:23 Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up, because you commanded us to consider the mountain sacred and to mark a boundary around it." 
02Ex 19:24 The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron back with you. But the priests and the people must not cross the boundary to come up to me, or I will punish them." 
02Ex 19:25 Moses then went down to the people and told them what the LORD had said. 
02Ex 20:1 God spoke, and these were his words£º 
02Ex 20:2 "I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt, where you were slaves. 
02Ex 20:3 "Worship no god but me. 
02Ex 20:4 "Do not make for yourselves images of anything in heaven or on earth or in the water under the earth. 
02Ex 20:5 Do not bow down to any idol or worship it, because I am the LORD your God and I tolerate no rivals. I bring punishment on those who hate me and on their descendants down to the third and fourth generation. 
02Ex 20:6 But I show my love to thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my laws. 
02Ex 20:7 "Do not use my name for evil purposes, for I, the LORD your God, will punish anyone who misuses my name. 
02Ex 20:8 "Observe the Sabbath and keep it holy. 
02Ex 20:9 You have six days in which to do your work, 
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to me. On that day no one is to work - neither you, your children, your slaves, your animals, nor the foreigners who live in your country. 
02Ex 20:11 In six days I, the LORD, made the earth, the sky, the seas, and everything in them, but on the seventh day I rested. That is why I, the LORD, blessed the Sabbath and made it holy. 
02Ex 20:12 "Respect your father and your mother, so that you may live a long time in the land that I am giving you. 
02Ex 20:13 "Do not commit murder. 
02Ex 20:14 "Do not commit adultery. 
02Ex 20:15 "Do not steal. 
02Ex 20:16 "Do not accuse anyone falsely. 
02Ex 20:17 "Do not desire another man's house; do not desire his wife, his slaves, his cattle, his donkeys, or anything else that he owns." 
02Ex 20:18 When the people heard the thunder and the trumpet blast and saw the lightning and the smoking mountain, they trembled with fear and stood a long way off. 
02Ex 20:19 They said to Moses, "If you speak to us, we will listen; but we are afraid that if God speaks to us, we will die." 
02Ex 20:20 Moses replied, "Don't be afraid; God has only come to test you and make you keep on obeying him, so that you will not sin." 
02Ex 20:21 But the people continued to stand a long way off, and only Moses went near the dark cloud where God was. 
02Ex 20:22 The LORD commanded Moses to tell the Israelites£º "You have seen how I, the LORD, have spoken to you from heaven. 
02Ex 20:23 Do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gold to be worshiped in addition to me. 
02Ex 20:24 Make an altar of earth for me, and on it sacrifice your sheep and your cattle as offerings to be completely burned and as fellowship offerings. In every place that I set aside for you to worship me, I will come to you and bless you. 
02Ex 20:25 If you make an altar of stone for me, do not build it out of cut stones, because when you use a chisel on stones, you make them unfit for my use. 
02Ex 20:26 Do not build an altar for me with steps leading up to it; if you do, you will expose yourselves as you go up the steps. 
02Ex 21:1 "Give the Israelites the following laws£º 
02Ex 21:2 If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve you for six years. In the seventh year he is to be set free without having to pay anything. 
02Ex 21:3 If he was unmarried when he became your slave, he is not to take a wife with him when he leaves; but if he was married when he became your slave, he may take his wife with him. 
02Ex 21:4 If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, the woman and her children belong to the master, and the man is to leave by himself. 
02Ex 21:5 But if the slave declares that he loves his master, his wife, and his children and does not want to be set free, 
02Ex 21:6 then his master shall take him to the place of worship. There he is to make him stand against the door or the doorpost and put a hole through his ear. Then he will be his slave for life. 
02Ex 21:7 "If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to be set free, as male slaves are. 
02Ex 21:8 If she is sold to someone who intends to make her his wife, but he doesn't like her, then she is to be sold back to her father; her master cannot sell her to foreigners, because he has treated her unfairly. 
02Ex 21:9 If a man buys a female slave to give to his son, he is to treat her like a daughter. 
02Ex 21:10 If a man takes a second wife, he must continue to give his first wife the same amount of food and clothing and the same rights that she had before. 
02Ex 21:11 If he does not fulfill these duties to her, he must set her free and not receive any payment. 
02Ex 21:12 "Whoever hits someone and kills him is to be put to death. 
02Ex 21:13 But if it was an accident and he did not mean to kill him, he can escape to a place which I will choose for you, and there he will be safe. 
02Ex 21:14 But when someone gets angry and deliberately kills someone else, he is to be put to death, even if he has run to my altar for safety. 
02Ex 21:15 "Whoever hits his father or his mother is to be put to death. 
02Ex 21:16 "Whoever kidnaps someone, either to sell him or to keep him as a slave, is to be put to death. 
02Ex 21:17 "Whoever curses his father or his mother is to be put to death. 
02Ex 21:18 "If there is a fight and someone hits someone else with a stone or with his fist, but does not kill him, he is not to be punished.
02Ex 21:19 If the one who was hit has to stay in bed, but later is able to get up and walk outside with the help of a cane, the one who hit him is to pay for his lost time and take care of him until he gets well. 
02Ex 21:20 "If a slave owner takes a stick and beats his slave, whether male or female, and the slave dies on the spot, the owner is to be punished. 
02Ex 21:21 But if the slave does not die for a day or two, the master is not to be punished. The loss of his property is punishment enough. 
02Ex 21:22 "If some men are fighting and hurt a pregnant woman so that she loses her child, but she is not injured in any other way, the one who hurt her is to be fined whatever amount the woman's husband demands, subject to the approval of the judges. 
02Ex 21:23 But if the woman herself is injured, the punishment shall be life for life, 
02Ex 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
02Ex 21:25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. 
02Ex 21:26 "If someone hits his male or female slave in the eye and puts it out, he is to free the slave as payment for the eye. 
02Ex 21:27 If he knocks out a tooth, he is to free the slave as payment for the tooth. 
02Ex 21:28 "If a bull gores someone to death, it is to be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but its owner is not to be punished. 
02Ex 21:29 But if the bull had been in the habit of attacking people and its owner had been warned, but did not keep it penned up - then if it gores someone to death, it is to be stoned, and its owner is to be put to death also. 
02Ex 21:30 However, if the owner is allowed to pay a fine to save his life, he must pay the full amount required. 
02Ex 21:31 If the bull kills a boy or a girl, the same rule applies. 
02Ex 21:32 If the bull kills a male or female slave, its owner shall pay the owner of the slave thirty pieces of silver, and the bull shall be stoned to death. 
02Ex 21:33 "If someone takes the cover off a pit or if he digs one and does not cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it, 
02Ex 21:34 he must pay for the animal. He is to pay the money to the owner and may keep the dead animal. 
02Ex 21:35 If someone's bull kills someone else's bull, the two of them shall sell the live bull and divide the money; they shall also divide up the meat from the dead animal. 
02Ex 21:36 But if it was known that the bull had been in the habit of attacking and its owner did not keep it penned up, he must make good the loss by giving the other man a live bull, but he may keep the dead animal. 
02Ex 22:1 "If someone steals a cow or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must pay five cows for one cow and four sheep for one sheep. 
02Ex 22:2 He must pay for what he stole. If he owns nothing, he shall be sold as a slave to pay for what he has stolen.
02Ex 22:3 If the stolen animal, whether a cow, a donkey, or a sheep, is found alive in his possession, he shall pay two for one. 
02Ex 22:4 "If a thief is caught breaking into a house at night and is killed, the one who killed him is not guilty of murder. But if it happens during the day, he is guilty of murder. 
02Ex 22:5 "If someone lets his animals graze in a field or a vineyard and they stray away and eat up the crops growing in someone else's field, he must make good the loss with the crops from his own fields or vineyards. 
02Ex 22:6 "If someone starts a fire in his own field and it spreads through the weeds to someone else's field and burns up grain that is growing or that has been cut and stacked, the one who started the fire is to pay for the damage. 
02Ex 22:7 "If anyone agrees to keep someone else's money or other valuables for him and they are stolen from his house, the thief, if found, shall repay double. 
02Ex 22:8 But if the thief is not found, the one who was keeping the valuables is to be brought to the place of worship and there he must take an oath that he has not stolen the other one's property. 
02Ex 22:9 "In every case of a dispute about property, whether it involves cattle, donkeys, sheep, clothing, or any other lost object, the two people claiming the property shall be taken to the place of worship. The one whom God declares to be guilty shall pay double to the other one. 
02Ex 22:10 "If anyone agrees to keep someone else's donkey, cow, sheep, or other animal for him, and the animal dies or is injured or is carried off in a raid, and if there was no witness, 
02Ex 22:11 the man must go to the place of worship and take an oath that he has not stolen the other man's animal. If the animal was not stolen, the owner shall accept the loss, and the other man need not repay him; 
02Ex 22:12 but if the animal was stolen, the man must repay the owner. 
02Ex 22:13 If it was killed by wild animals, the man is to bring the remains as evidence; he need not pay for what has been killed by wild animals. 
02Ex 22:14 "If anyone borrows an animal from someone else and it is injured or dies when its owner is not present, he must pay for it. 
02Ex 22:15 But if that happens when the owner is present, he need not repay. If it is a rented animal, the loss is covered by the rental price. 
02Ex 22:16 "If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, he must pay the bride price for her and marry her. 
02Ex 22:17 But if her father refuses to let him marry her, he must pay the father a sum of money equal to the bride price for a virgin. 
02Ex 22:18 "Put to death any woman who practices magic. 
02Ex 22:19 "Put to death any man who has sexual relations with an animal. 
02Ex 22:20 "Condemn to death anyone who offers sacrifices to any god except to me, the LORD. 
02Ex 22:21 "Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner; remember that you were foreigners in Egypt. 
02Ex 22:22 Do not mistreat any widow or orphan. 
02Ex 22:23 If you do, I, the LORD, will answer them when they cry out to me for help, 
02Ex 22:24 and I will become angry and kill you in war. Your wives will become widows, and your children will be fatherless. 
02Ex 22:25 "If you lend money to any of my people who are poor, do not act like a moneylender and require him to pay interest. 
02Ex 22:26 If you take someone's cloak as a pledge that he will pay you, you must give it back to him before the sun sets, 
02Ex 22:27 because it is the only covering he has to keep him warm. What else can he sleep in? When he cries out to me for help, I will answer him because I am merciful. 
02Ex 22:28 "Do not speak evil of God, and do not curse a leader of your people. 
02Ex 22:29 "Give me the offerings from your grain, your wine, and your olive oil when they are due. "Give me your first-born sons. 
02Ex 22:30 Give me the first-born of your cattle and your sheep. Let the first-born male stay with its mother for seven days, and on the eighth day offer it to me. 
02Ex 22:31 "You are my people, so you must not eat the meat of any animal that has been killed by wild animals; instead, give it to the dogs. 
02Ex 23:1 "Do not spread false rumors, and do not help a guilty person by giving false testimony. 
02Ex 23:2 Do not follow the majority when they do wrong or when they give testimony that perverts justice. 
02Ex 23:3 Do not show partiality to a poor person at his trial. 
02Ex 23:4 "If you happen to see your enemy's cow or donkey running loose, take it back to him. 
02Ex 23:5 If his donkey has fallen under its load, help him get the donkey to its feet again; don't just walk off. 
02Ex 23:6 "Do not deny justice to a poor person when he appears in court. 
02Ex 23:7 Do not make false accusations, and do not put an innocent person to death, for I will condemn anyone who does such an evil thing. 
02Ex 23:8 Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe makes people blind to what is right and ruins the cause of those who are innocent. 
02Ex 23:9 "Do not mistreat a foreigner; you know how it feels to be a foreigner, because you were foreigners in Egypt. 
02Ex 23:10 "For six years plant your land and gather in what it produces. 
02Ex 23:11 But in the seventh year let it rest, and do not harvest anything that grows on it. The poor may eat what grows there, and the wild animals can have what is left. Do the same with your vineyards and your olive trees. 
02Ex 23:12 "Work six days a week, but do no work on the seventh day, so that your slaves and the foreigners who work for you and even your animals can rest. 
02Ex 23:13 "Listen to everything that I, the LORD, have said to you. Do not pray to other gods; do not even mention their names. 
02Ex 23:14 "Celebrate three festivals a year to honor me. 
02Ex 23:15 In the month of Abib, the month in which you left Egypt, celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the way that I commanded you. Do not eat any bread made with yeast during the seven days of this festival. Never come to worship me without bringing an offering. 
02Ex 23:16 "Celebrate the Harvest Festival when you begin to harvest your crops. "Celebrate the Festival of Shelters in the autumn, when you gather the fruit from your vineyards and orchards. 
02Ex 23:17 Every year at these three festivals all your men must come to worship me, the Lord your God. 
02Ex 23:18 "Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. The fat of animals sacrificed to me during these festivals is not to be left until the following morning. 
02Ex 23:19 "Each year bring to the house of the LORD your God the first grain that you harvest. "Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk. 
02Ex 23:20 "I will send an angel ahead of you to protect you as you travel and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. 
02Ex 23:21 Pay attention to him and obey him. Do not rebel against him, for I have sent him, and he will not pardon such rebellion. 
02Ex 23:22 But if you obey him and do everything I command, I will fight against all your enemies. 
02Ex 23:23 My angel will go ahead of you and take you into the land of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I will destroy them. 
02Ex 23:24 Do not bow down to their gods or worship them, and do not adopt their religious practices. Destroy their gods and break down their sacred stone pillars. 
02Ex 23:25 If you worship me, the LORD your God, I will bless you with food and water and take away all your sicknesses. 
02Ex 23:26 In your land no woman will have a miscarriage or be without children. I will give you long lives. 
02Ex 23:27 "I will make the people who oppose you afraid of me; I will bring confusion among the people against whom you fight, and I will make all your enemies turn and run from you. 
02Ex 23:28 I will throw your enemies into panic; I will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites as you advance. 
02Ex 23:29 I will not drive them out within a year's time; if I did, the land would become deserted, and the wild animals would be too many for you. 
02Ex 23:30 Instead, I will drive them out little by little, until there are enough of you to take possession of the land. 
02Ex 23:31 I will make the borders of your land extend from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterranean Sea and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give you power over the inhabitants of the land, and you will drive them out as you advance. 
02Ex 23:32 Do not make any agreement with them or with their gods. 
02Ex 23:33 Do not let those people live in your country; if you do, they will make you sin against me. If you worship their gods, it will be a fatal trap for you." 
02Ex 24:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Come up the mountain to me, you and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the leaders of Israel; and while you are still some distance away, bow down in worship. 
02Ex 24:2 You alone, and none of the others, are to come near me. The people are not even to come up the mountain." 
02Ex 24:3 Moses went and told the people all the LORD's commands and all the ordinances, and all the people answered together, "We will do everything that the LORD has said." 
02Ex 24:4 Moses wrote down all the LORD's commands. Early the next morning he built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
02Ex 24:5 Then he sent young men, and they burned sacrifices to the LORD and sacrificed some cattle as fellowship offerings. 
02Ex 24:6 Moses took half of the blood of the animals and put it in bowls; and the other half he threw against the altar. 
02Ex 24:7 Then he took the book of the covenant, in which the LORD's commands were written, and read it aloud to the people. They said, "We will obey the LORD and do everything that he has commanded." 
02Ex 24:8 Then Moses took the blood in the bowls and threw it on the people. He said, "This is the blood that seals the covenant which the LORD made with you when he gave all these commands." 
02Ex 24:9 Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the leaders of Israel went up the mountain 
02Ex 24:10 and they saw the God of Israel. Beneath his feet was what looked like a pavement of sapphire, as blue as the sky. 
02Ex 24:11 God did not harm these leading men of Israel; they saw God, and then they ate and drank together. 
02Ex 24:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Come up the mountain to me, and while you are here, I will give you two stone tablets which contain all the laws that I have written for the instruction of the people." 
02Ex 24:13 Moses and his helper Joshua got ready, and Moses began to go up the holy mountain. 
02Ex 24:14 Moses said to the leaders, "Wait here in the camp for us until we come back. Aaron and Hur are here with you; and so whoever has a dispute to settle can go to them." 
02Ex 24:15 Moses went up Mount Sinai, and a cloud covered it. 
02Ex 24:16 The dazzling light of the LORD's presence came down on the mountain. To the Israelites the light looked like a fire burning on top of the mountain.
02Ex 24:17 The cloud covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from the cloud.
02Ex 24:18 Moses went on up the mountain into the cloud. There he stayed for forty days and nights. 
02Ex 25:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the Israelites to make an offering to me. Receive whatever offerings anyone wishes to give. 
02Ex 25:3 These offerings are to be£º gold, silver, and bronze; 
02Ex 25:4 fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; cloth made of goats' hair; 
02Ex 25:5 rams' skin dyed red; fine leather; acacia wood; 
02Ex 25:6 oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense; 
02Ex 25:7 carnelians and other jewels to be set in the ephod of the High Priest and in his breastpiece. 
02Ex 25:8 The people must make a sacred Tent for me, so that I may live among them. 
02Ex 25:9 Make it and all its furnishings according to the plan that I will show you. 
02Ex 25:10 "Make a Box out of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 25:11 Cover it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold border all around it. 
02Ex 25:12 Make four carrying rings of gold for it and attach them to its four legs, with two rings on each side. 
02Ex 25:13 Make carrying poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold 
02Ex 25:14 and put them through the rings on each side of the Box. 
02Ex 25:15 The poles are to be left in the rings and must not be taken out. 
02Ex 25:16 Then put in the Box the two stone tablets that I will give you, on which the commandments are written. 
02Ex 25:17 "Make a lid of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. 
02Ex 25:18 Make two winged creatures of hammered gold, 
02Ex 25:19 one for each end of the lid. Make them so that they form one piece with the lid. 
02Ex 25:20 The winged creatures are to face each other across the lid, and their outspread wings are to cover it. 
02Ex 25:21 Put the two stone tablets inside the Box and put the lid on top of it. 
02Ex 25:22 I will meet you there, and from above the lid between the two winged creatures I will give you all my laws for the people of Israel. 
02Ex 25:23 "Make a table out of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 25:24 Cover it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 
02Ex 25:25 Make a rim 3 inches wide around it and a gold border around the rim. 
02Ex 25:26 Make four carrying rings of gold for it and put them at the four corners, where the legs are. 
02Ex 25:27 The rings to hold the poles for carrying the table are to be placed near the rim. 
02Ex 25:28 Make the poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold. 
02Ex 25:29 Make plates, cups, jars, and bowls to be used for the wine offerings. All of these are to be made of pure gold. 
02Ex 25:30 The table is to be placed in front of the Covenant Box, and on the table there is always to be the sacred bread offered to me. 
02Ex 25:31 "Make a lampstand of pure gold. Make its base and its shaft of hammered gold; its decorative flowers, including buds and petals, are to form one piece with it. 
02Ex 25:32 Six branches shall extend from its sides, three from each side. 
02Ex 25:33 Each of the six branches is to have three decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02Ex 25:34 The shaft of the lampstand is to have four decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02Ex 25:35 There is to be one bud below each of the three pairs of branches. 
02Ex 25:36 The buds, the branches, and the lampstand are to be a single piece of pure hammered gold. 
02Ex 25:37 Make seven lamps for the lampstand and set them up so that they shine toward the front. 
02Ex 25:38 Make its tongs and trays of pure gold. 
02Ex 25:39 Use seventy-five pounds of pure gold to make the lampstand and all this equipment. 
02Ex 25:40 Take care to make them according to the plan that I showed you on the mountain.

02Ex 28:30 Put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece, so that Aaron will carry them when he comes into my holy presence. At such times he must always wear this breastpiece, so that he can determine my will for the people of Israel. 
02Ex 28:31 "The robe that goes under the ephod is to be made entirely of blue wool. 
02Ex 28:32 It is to have a hole for the head, and this hole is to be reinforced with a woven binding to keep it from tearing.

02Ex 28:42 Make linen shorts for them, reaching from the waist to the thighs, so that they will not expose themselves. 
02Ex 28:43 Aaron and his sons must always wear them when they go into the Tent of my presence or approach the altar to serve as priests in the Holy Place, so that they will not be killed for exposing themselves. This is a permanent rule for Aaron and his descendants. 
02Ex 29:1 "This is what you are to do to Aaron and his sons to dedicate them as priests in my service. Take one young bull and two rams without any defects. 
02Ex 29:2 Use the best wheat flour, but no yeast, and make some bread with olive oil, some without it, and some in the form of thin cakes brushed with oil. 
02Ex 29:3 Put them in a basket and offer them to me when you sacrifice the bull and the two rams. 
02Ex 29:4 "Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of my presence, and have them take a ritual bath. 
02Ex 29:5 Then dress Aaron in the priestly garments - the shirt, the robe that goes under the ephod, the ephod, the breastpiece, and the belt. 
02Ex 29:6 Put the turban on him and tie on it the sacred sign of dedication engraved 'Dedicated to the LORD.' 
02Ex 29:7 Then take the anointing oil, pour it on his head, and anoint him. 
02Ex 29:8 "Bring his sons and put shirts on them; 
02Ex 29:9 put sashes around their waists and tie caps on their heads. That is how you are to ordain Aaron and his sons. They and their descendants are to serve me as priests forever. 
02Ex 29:10 "Bring the bull to the front of the Tent of my presence and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on its head. 
02Ex 29:11 Kill the bull there in my holy presence at the entrance of the Tent. 
02Ex 29:12 Take some of the bull's blood and with your finger put it on the projections of the altar. Then pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
02Ex 29:13 Next, take all the fat which covers the internal organs, the best part of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar as an offering to me. 
02Ex 29:14 But burn the bull's flesh, its skin, and its intestines outside the camp. This is an offering to take away the sins of the priests. 
02Ex 29:15 "Take one of the rams and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on its head. 
02Ex 29:16 Kill it, and take its blood and throw it against all four sides of the altar. 
02Ex 29:17 Cut the ram in pieces; wash its internal organs and its hind legs, and put them on top of the head and the other pieces. 
02Ex 29:18 Burn the whole ram on the altar as a food offering. The odor of this offering pleases me. 
02Ex 29:19 "Take the other ram - the ram used for dedication - and tell Aaron and his sons to put their hands on its head. 
02Ex 29:20 Kill it, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobes of the right ears of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Throw the rest of the blood against all four sides of the altar. 
02Ex 29:21 Take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his clothes and on his sons and their clothes. He, his sons, and their clothes will then be dedicated to me. 
02Ex 29:22 "Cut away the ram's fat, the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs, the best part of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh. 
02Ex 29:23 From the basket of bread which has been offered to me, take one loaf of each kind£º one loaf made with olive oil and one made without it and one thin cake. 
02Ex 29:24 Put all this food in the hands of Aaron and his sons and have them dedicate it to me as a special gift. 
02Ex 29:25 Then take it from them and burn it on the altar, on top of the burnt offering, as a food offering to me. The odor of this offering pleases me. 
02Ex 29:26 "Take the breast of this ram and dedicate it to me as a special gift. This part of the animal will be yours. 
02Ex 29:27 "When a priest is ordained, the breast and the thigh of the ram being used for the ordination are to be dedicated to me as a special gift and set aside for the priests. 
02Ex 29:28 It is my unchanging decision that when my people make their fellowship offerings, the breast and the thigh of the animal belong to the priests. This is the people's gift to me, the LORD. 
02Ex 29:29 "Aaron's priestly garments are to be handed on to his sons after his death, for them to wear when they are ordained. 
02Ex 29:30 The son of Aaron who succeeds him as priest and who goes into the Tent of my presence to serve in the Holy Place is to wear these garments for seven days. 
02Ex 29:31 "Take the meat of the ram used for the ordination of Aaron and his sons and boil it in a holy place. 
02Ex 29:32 At the entrance of the Tent of my presence they are to eat it along with the bread left in the basket. 
02Ex 29:33 They shall eat what was used in the ritual of forgiveness at their ordination. Only priests may eat this food, because it is sacred. 
02Ex 29:34 If some of the meat or some of the bread is not eaten by morning, it is to be burned; it is not to be eaten, for it is sacred. 
02Ex 29:35 "Perform the rites of ordination for Aaron and his sons for seven days exactly as I have commanded you. 
02Ex 29:36 Each day you must offer a bull as a sacrifice, so that sin may be forgiven. This will purify the altar. Then anoint it with olive oil to make it holy. 
02Ex 29:37 Do this every day for seven days. Then the altar will be completely holy, and anyone or anything that touches it will be harmed by the power of its holiness. 
02Ex 29:38 "Every day for all time to come, sacrifice on the altar two one-year-old lambs. 
02Ex 29:39 Sacrifice one of the lambs in the morning and the other in the evening. 
02Ex 29:40 With the first lamb offer two pounds of fine wheat flour mixed with one quart of pure olive oil. Pour out one quart of wine as an offering. 
02Ex 29:41 Sacrifice the second lamb in the evening, and offer with it the same amounts of flour, olive oil, and wine as in the morning. This is a food offering to me, the LORD, and its odor pleases me. 
02Ex 29:42 For all time to come, this burnt offering is to be offered in my presence at the entrance of the Tent of my presence. That is where I will meet my people and speak to you. 
02Ex 29:43 There I will meet the people of Israel, and the dazzling light of my presence will make the place holy. 
02Ex 29:44 I will make the Tent and the altar holy, and I will set Aaron and his sons apart to serve me as priests. 
02Ex 29:45 I will live among the people of Israel, and I will be their God. 
02Ex 29:46 They will know that I am the LORD their God who brought them out of Egypt so that I could live among them. I am the LORD their God. 
02Ex 30:1 "Make an altar out of acacia wood, for burning incense. 
02Ex 30:2 It is to be square, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide, and it is to be 36 inches high. Its projections at the four corners are to form one piece with it. 
02Ex 30:3 Cover its top, all four sides, and its projections with pure gold, and put a gold border around it. 
02Ex 30:4 Make two gold carrying rings for it and attach them below the border on two sides to hold the poles with which it is to be carried. 
02Ex 30:5 Make these poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold. 
02Ex 30:6 Put this altar outside the curtain which hangs in front of the Covenant Box. That is the place where I will meet you. 
02Ex 30:7 Every morning when Aaron comes to take care of the lamps, he is to burn sweet-smelling incense on it. 
02Ex 30:8 He must do the same when he lights the lamps in the evening. This offering of incense is to continue without interruption for all time to come. 
02Ex 30:9 Do not offer on this altar any forbidden incense, any animal offering, or any grain offering, and do not pour out any wine offering on it. 
02Ex 30:10 Once a year Aaron is to perform the ritual for purifying the altar by putting on its four projections the blood of the animal sacrificed for sin. This is to be done every year for all time to come. This altar is to be completely holy, dedicated to me, the LORD." 
02Ex 30:11 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:12 "When you take a census of the people of Israel, each man is to pay me a price for his life, so that no disaster will come on him while the census is being taken. 
02Ex 30:13 Everyone included in the census must pay the required amount of money, weighed according to the official standard. Everyone must pay this as an offering to me. 
02Ex 30:14 Everyone being counted in the census, that is, every man twenty years old or older, is to pay me this amount. 
02Ex 30:15 The rich man is not to pay more, nor the poor man less, when they pay this amount for their lives. 
02Ex 30:16 Collect this money from the people of Israel and spend it for the upkeep of the Tent of my presence. This tax will be the payment for their lives, and I will remember to protect them." 
02Ex 30:17 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:18 "Make a bronze basin with a bronze base. Place it between the Tent and the altar, and put water in it. 
02Ex 30:19 Aaron and his sons are to use the water to wash their hands and feet 
02Ex 30:20 before they go into the Tent or approach the altar to offer the food offering. Then they will not be killed. 
02Ex 30:21 They must wash their hands and feet, so that they will not die. This is a rule which they and their descendants are to observe forever." 
02Ex 30:22 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:23 "Take the finest spices - 12 pounds of liquid myrrh, 6 pounds of sweet-smelling cinnamon, 6 pounds of sweet-smelling cane, 
02Ex 30:24 and 12 pounds of cassia (all weighed according to the official standard). Add one gallon of olive oil, 
02Ex 30:25 and make a sacred anointing oil, mixed like perfume. 
02Ex 30:26 Use it to anoint the Tent of my presence, the Covenant Box, 
02Ex 30:27 the table and all its equipment, the lampstand and its equipment, the altar for burning incense, 
02Ex 30:28 the altar for burning offerings, together with all its equipment, and the washbasin with its base. 
02Ex 30:29 Dedicate these things in this way, and they will be completely holy, and anyone or anything that touches them will be harmed by the power of its holiness. 
02Ex 30:30 Then anoint Aaron and his sons, and ordain them as priests in my service. 
02Ex 30:31 Say to the people of Israel, 'This holy anointing oil is to be used in my service for all time to come. 
02Ex 30:32 It must not be poured on ordinary men, and you must not use the same formula to make any mixture like it. It is holy, and you must treat it as holy. 
02Ex 30:33 Whoever makes any like it or uses any of it on anyone who is not a priest will no longer be considered one of my people.' " 
02Ex 30:34 The LORD said to Moses, "Take an equal part of each of the following sweet spices - stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense. 
02Ex 30:35 Use them to make incense, mixed like perfume. Add salt to keep it pure and holy. 
02Ex 30:36 Beat part of it into a fine powder, take it into the Tent of my presence, and sprinkle it in front of the Covenant Box. Treat this incense as completely holy. 
02Ex 30:37 Do not use the same formula to make any incense like it for yourselves. Treat it as a holy thing dedicated to me. 
02Ex 30:38 If anyone makes any like it for use as perfume, he will no longer be considered one of my people." 
02Ex 31:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 31:2 "I have chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, 
02Ex 31:3 and I have filled him with my power. I have given him understanding, skill, and ability for every kind of artistic work - 
02Ex 31:4 for planning skillful designs and working them in gold, silver, and bronze; 
02Ex 31:5 for cutting jewels to be set; for carving wood; and for every other kind of artistic work. 
02Ex 31:6 I have also selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to work with him. I have also given great ability to all the other skilled workers, so that they can make everything I have commanded to be made£º 
02Ex 31:7 the Tent of my presence, the Covenant Box and its lid, all the furnishings of the Tent, 
02Ex 31:8 the table and its equipment, the lampstand of pure gold and all its equipment, the altar for burning incense, 
02Ex 31:9 the altar for burnt offerings and all its equipment, the washbasin and its base, 
02Ex 31:10 the magnificent priestly garments for Aaron and his sons to use when they serve as priests, 
02Ex 31:11 the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place. In making all these things, they are to do exactly as I have commanded you." 
02Ex 31:12 The LORD commanded Moses 
02Ex 31:13 to tell the people of Israel, "Keep the Sabbath, my day of rest, because it is a sign between you and me for all time to come, to show that I, the LORD, have made you my own people. 
02Ex 31:14 You must keep the day of rest, because it is sacred. Whoever does not keep it, but works on that day, is to be put to death. 
02Ex 31:15 You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is a solemn day of rest dedicated to me. Whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death. 
02Ex 31:16 The people of Israel are to keep this day as a sign of the covenant. 
02Ex 31:17 It is a permanent sign between the people of Israel and me, because I, the LORD, made heaven and earth in six days, and on the seventh day I stopped working and rested." 
02Ex 31:18 When God had finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets on which God himself had written the commandments. 
02Ex 32:1 When the people saw that Moses had not come down from the mountain but was staying there a long time, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, "We do not know what has happened to this man Moses, who led us out of Egypt; so make us a god to lead us." 
02Ex 32:2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the gold earrings which your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me." 
02Ex 32:3 So all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
02Ex 32:4 He took the earrings, melted them, poured the gold into a mold, and made a gold bull-calf. The people said, "Israel, this is our god, who led us out of Egypt!" 
02Ex 32:5 Then Aaron built an altar in front of the gold bull-calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to honor the LORD." 
02Ex 32:6 Early the next morning they brought some animals to burn as sacrifices and others to eat as fellowship offerings. The people sat down to a feast, which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex. 
02Ex 32:7 The LORD said to Moses, "Hurry and go back down, because your people, whom you led out of Egypt, have sinned and rejected me. 
02Ex 32:8 They have already left the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made a bull-calf out of melted gold and have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it. They are saying that this is their god, who led them out of Egypt. 
02Ex 32:9 I know how stubborn these people are. 
02Ex 32:10 Now, don't try to stop me. I am angry with them, and I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you and your descendants into a great nation." 
02Ex 32:11 But Moses pleaded with the LORD his God and said, " LORD, why should you be so angry with your people, whom you rescued from Egypt with great might and power? 
02Ex 32:12 Why should the Egyptians be able to say that you led your people out of Egypt, planning to kill them in the mountains and destroy them completely? Stop being angry; change your mind and do not bring this disaster on your people. 
02Ex 32:13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Remember the solemn promise you made to them to give them as many descendants as there are stars in the sky and to give their descendants all that land you promised would be their possession forever." 
02Ex 32:14 So the LORD changed his mind and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. 
02Ex 32:15 Moses went back down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets with the commandments written on both sides. 
02Ex 32:16 God himself had made the tablets and had engraved the commandments on them. 
02Ex 32:17 Joshua heard the people shouting and said to Moses, "I hear the sound of battle in the camp." 
02Ex 32:18 Moses said, "That doesn't sound like a shout of victory or a cry of defeat; it's the sound of singing." 
02Ex 32:19 When Moses came close enough to the camp to see the bull-calf and to see the people dancing, he became furious. There at the foot of the mountain, he threw down the tablets he was carrying and broke them. 
02Ex 32:20 He took the bull-calf which they had made, melted it, ground it into fine powder, and mixed it with water. Then he made the people of Israel drink it. 
02Ex 32:21 He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have made them commit such a terrible sin?" 
02Ex 32:22 Aaron answered, "Don't be angry with me; you know how determined these people are to do evil. 
02Ex 32:23 They said to me, 'We don't know what has happened to this man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt; so make us a god to lead us.' 
02Ex 32:24 I asked them to bring me their gold ornaments, and those who had any took them off and gave them to me. I threw the ornaments into the fire and out came this bull-calf!" 
02Ex 32:25 Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control and make fools of themselves in front of their enemies. 
02Ex 32:26 So he stood at the gate of the camp and shouted, "Everyone who is on the LORD's side come over here!" So all the Levites gathered around him, 
02Ex 32:27 and he said to them, "The LORD God of Israel commands every one of you to put on your sword and go through the camp from this gate to the other and kill your brothers, your friends, and your neighbors." 
02Ex 32:28 The Levites obeyed, and killed about three thousand men that day. 
02Ex 32:29 Moses said to the Levites, "Today you have consecrated yourselves as priests in the service of the LORD by killing your sons and brothers, so the LORD has given you his blessing." 
02Ex 32:30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a terrible sin. But now I will again go up the mountain to the LORD; perhaps I can obtain forgiveness for your sin." 
02Ex 32:31 Moses then returned to the LORD and said, "These people have committed a terrible sin. They have made a god out of gold and worshiped it. 
02Ex 32:32 Please forgive their sin; but if you won't, then remove my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people." 
02Ex 32:33 The LORD answered, "It is those who have sinned against me whose names I will remove from my book. 
02Ex 32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Remember that my angel will guide you, but the time is coming when I will punish these people for their sin." 
02Ex 32:35 So the LORD sent a disease on the people, because they had caused Aaron to make the gold bull-calf. 
02Ex 33:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought out of Egypt, and go to the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and to their descendants. 
02Ex 33:2 I will send an angel to guide you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
02Ex 33:3 You are going to a rich and fertile land. But I will not go with you myself, because you are a stubborn people, and I might destroy you on the way." 
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard this, they began to mourn and did not wear jewelry any more. 
02Ex 33:5 For the LORD had commanded Moses to tell them, "You are a stubborn people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I would completely destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you." 
02Ex 33:6 So after they left Mount Sinai, the people of Israel no longer wore jewelry. 
02Ex 33:7 Whenever the people of Israel set up camp, Moses would take the sacred Tent and put it up some distance outside the camp. It was called the Tent of the LORD's presence, and anyone who wanted to consult the LORD would go out to it. 
02Ex 33:8 Whenever Moses went out there, the people would stand at the door of their tents and watch Moses until he entered it. 
02Ex 33:9 After Moses had gone in, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the door of the Tent, and the LORD would speak to Moses from the cloud. 
02Ex 33:10 As soon as the people saw the pillar of cloud at the door of the Tent, they would bow down. 
02Ex 33:11 The LORD would speak with Moses face-to-face, just as someone speaks with a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp. But the young man who was his helper, Joshua son of Nun, stayed in the Tent. 
02Ex 33:12 Moses said to the LORD, "It is true that you have told me to lead these people to that land, but you did not tell me whom you would send with me. You have said that you know me well and are pleased with me. 
02Ex 33:13 Now if you are, tell me your plans, so that I may serve you and continue to please you. Remember also that you have chosen this nation to be your own." 
02Ex 33:14 The LORD said, "I will go with you, and I will give you victory." 
02Ex 33:15 Moses replied, "If you do not go with us, don't make us leave this place. 
02Ex 33:16 How will anyone know that you are pleased with your people and with me if you do not go with us? Your presence with us will distinguish us from any other people on earth." 
02Ex 33:17 The LORD said to Moses, "I will do just as you have asked, because I know you very well and I am pleased with you." 
02Ex 33:18 Then Moses requested, "Please, let me see the dazzling light of your presence." 
02Ex 33:19 The LORD answered, "I will make all my splendor pass before you and in your presence I will pronounce my sacred name. I am the LORD, and I show compassion and pity on those I choose. 
02Ex 33:20 I will not let you see my face, because no one can see me and stay alive, 
02Ex 33:21 but here is a place beside me where you can stand on a rock. 
02Ex 33:22 When the dazzling light of my presence passes by, I will put you in an opening in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
02Ex 33:23 Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back but not my face." 
02Ex 34:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
02Ex 34:2 Get ready tomorrow morning, and come up Mount Sinai to meet me there at the top. 
02Ex 34:3 No one is to come up with you; no one is to be seen on any part of the mountain; and no sheep or cattle are to graze at the foot of the mountain." 
02Ex 34:4 So Moses cut two more stone tablets, and early the next morning he carried them up Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 34:5 The LORD came down in a cloud, stood with him there, and pronounced his holy name, the LORD. 
02Ex 34:6 The LORD then passed in front of him and called out, "I, the LORD, am a God who is full of compassion and pity, who is not easily angered and who shows great love and faithfulness. 
02Ex 34:7 I keep my promise for thousands of generations and forgive evil and sin; but I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents." 
02Ex 34:8 Moses quickly bowed down to the ground and worshiped. 
02Ex 34:9 He said, "Lord, if you really are pleased with me, I ask you to go with us. These people are stubborn, but forgive our evil and our sin, and accept us as your own people." 
02Ex 34:10 The LORD said to Moses, "I now make a covenant with the people of Israel. In their presence I will do great things such as have never been done anywhere on earth among any of the nations. All the people will see what great things I, the LORD, can do, because I am going to do an awesome thing for you. 
02Ex 34:11 Obey the laws that I am giving you today. I will drive out the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as you advance. 
02Ex 34:12 Do not make any treaties with the people of the country into which you are going, because this could be a fatal trap for you. 
02Ex 34:13 Instead, tear down their altars, destroy their sacred pillars, and cut down their symbols of the goddess Asherah. 
02Ex 34:14 "Do not worship any other god, because I, the LORD, tolerate no rivals. 
02Ex 34:15 Do not make any treaties with the people of the country, because when they worship their pagan gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you to join them, and you will be tempted to eat the food they offer to their gods. 
02Ex 34:16 Your sons might marry those foreign women, who would lead them to be unfaithful to me and to worship their pagan gods. 
02Ex 34:17 "Do not make gods of metal and worship them. 
02Ex 34:18 "Keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread. As I have commanded you, eat unleavened bread for seven days in the month of Abib, because it was in that month that you left Egypt. 
02Ex 34:19 "Every first-born son and first-born male domestic animal belongs to me, 
02Ex 34:20 but you are to buy back every first-born donkey by offering a lamb in its place. If you do not buy it back, break its neck. Buy back every first-born son. "No one is to appear before me without an offering. 
02Ex 34:21 "You have six days in which to do your work, but do not work on the seventh day, not even during plowing time or harvest. 
02Ex 34:22 "Keep the Harvest Festival when you begin to harvest the first crop of your wheat, and keep the Festival of Shelters in the autumn when you gather your fruit. 
02Ex 34:23 "Three times a year all of your men must come to worship me, the LORD, the God of Israel. 
02Ex 34:24 After I have driven out the nations before you and extended your territory, no one will try to conquer your country during the three festivals. 
02Ex 34:25 "Do not offer bread made with yeast when you sacrifice an animal to me. Do not keep until the following morning any part of the animal killed at the Passover Festival. 
02Ex 34:26 "Each year bring to the house of the LORD the first grain that you harvest. "Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk." 
02Ex 34:27 The LORD said to Moses, "Write these words down, because it is on the basis of these words that I am making a covenant with you and with Israel." 
02Ex 34:28 Moses stayed there with the LORD forty days and nights, eating and drinking nothing. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant - the Ten Commandments. 
02Ex 34:29 When Moses went down from Mount Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments, his face was shining because he had been speaking with the LORD; but he did not know it. 
02Ex 34:30 Aaron and all the people looked at Moses and saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him. 
02Ex 34:31 But Moses called them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community went to him, and Moses spoke with them. 
02Ex 34:32 After that, all the people of Israel gathered around him, and Moses gave them all the laws that the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai. 
02Ex 34:33 When Moses had finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil. 
02Ex 34:34 Whenever Moses went into the Tent of the LORD's presence to speak to the LORD, he would take the veil off. When he came out, he would tell the people of Israel everything that he had been commanded to say, 
02Ex 34:35 and they would see that his face was shining. Then he would put the veil back on until the next time he went to speak with the LORD. 
02Ex 35:1 Moses called together the whole community of the people of Israel and said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do£º 
02Ex 35:2 You have six days in which to do your work, but the seventh day is to be sacred, a solemn day of rest dedicated to me, the LORD. Anyone who does any work on that day is to be put to death. 
02Ex 35:3 Do not even light a fire in your homes on the Sabbath." 
02Ex 35:4 Moses said to all the people of Israel, "This is what the LORD has commanded£º 
02Ex 35:5 Make an offering to the LORD. Everyone who wishes to do so is to bring an offering of gold, silver, or bronze; 
02Ex 35:6 fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; cloth made of goats' hair; 
02Ex 35:7 rams' skin dyed red; fine leather; acacia wood; 
02Ex 35:8 oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense; 
02Ex 35:9 carnelians and other jewels to be set in the High Priest's ephod and in his breastpiece. 
02Ex 35:10 "All the skilled workers among you are to come and make everything that the LORD commanded£º 
02Ex 35:11 the Tent, its covering and its outer covering, its hooks and its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases; 
02Ex 35:12 the Covenant Box, its poles, its lid, and the curtain to screen it off; 
02Ex 35:13 the table, its poles, and all its equipment; the bread offered to God; 
02Ex 35:14 the lampstand for the light and its equipment; the lamps with their oil; 
02Ex 35:15 the altar for burning incense and its poles; the anointing oil; the sweet-smelling incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tent; 
02Ex 35:16 the altar on which to burn offerings, with its bronze grating attached, its poles, and all its equipment; the washbasin and its base; 
02Ex 35:17 the curtains for the enclosure, its posts and bases; the curtain for the entrance of the enclosure; 
02Ex 35:18 the Tent pegs and ropes for the Tent and the enclosure; 
02Ex 35:19 and the magnificent garments the priests are to wear when they serve in the Holy Place - the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons." 
02Ex 35:20 All the people of Israel left, 
02Ex 35:21 and everyone who wished to do so brought an offering to the LORD for making the Tent of the LORD's presence. They brought everything needed for use in worship and for making the priestly garments. 
02Ex 35:22 All who wanted to, both men and women, brought decorative pins, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry and dedicated them to the LORD. 
02Ex 35:23 Everyone who had fine linen; blue, purple, or red wool; cloth of goats' hair; rams' skin dyed red; or fine leather, brought it. 
02Ex 35:24 All who were able to contribute silver or bronze brought their offering for the LORD, and all who had acacia wood which could be used for any of the work brought it. 
02Ex 35:25 All the skilled women brought fine linen thread and thread of blue, purple, and red wool, which they had made. 
02Ex 35:26 They also made thread of goats' hair. 
02Ex 35:27 The leaders brought carnelians and other jewels to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece 
02Ex 35:28 and spices and oil for the lamps, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet-smelling incense. 
02Ex 35:29 All the people of Israel who wanted to brought their offering to the LORD for the work which he had commanded Moses to do. 
02Ex 35:30 Moses said to the Israelites, "The LORD has chosen Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah. 
02Ex 35:31 God has filled him with his power and given him skill, ability, and understanding for every kind of artistic work, 
02Ex 35:32 for planning skillful designs and working them in gold, silver, and bronze; 
02Ex 35:33 for cutting jewels to be set; for carving wood; and for every other kind of artistic work. 
02Ex 35:34 The LORD has given to him and to Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their crafts to others. 
02Ex 35:35 He has given them skill in all kinds of work done by engravers, designers, and weavers of fine linen; blue, purple, and red wool; and other cloth. They are able to do all kinds of work and are skillful designers. 
02Ex 36:1 "Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other workers to whom the LORD has given skill and understanding, who know how to make everything needed to build the sacred Tent, are to make everything just as the LORD has commanded." 
02Ex 36:2 Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other skilled men to whom the LORD had given ability and who were willing to help, and Moses told them to start working. 
02Ex 36:3 They received from him all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for constructing the sacred Tent. But the people of Israel continued to bring Moses their offerings every morning. 
02Ex 36:4 Then the skilled men who were doing the work went 
02Ex 36:5 and told Moses, "The people are bringing more than is needed for the work which the LORD commanded to be done." 
02Ex 36:6 So Moses sent a command throughout the camp that no one was to make any further contribution for the sacred Tent; so the people did not bring any more. 
02Ex 36:7 What had already been brought was more than enough to finish all the work. 
02Ex 36:8 The most skilled men among those doing the work made the Tent of the LORD's presence. They made it out of ten pieces of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered with figures of winged creatures. 
02Ex 36:9 Each piece was the same size, 14 yards long and 2 yards wide. 
02Ex 36:10 They sewed five of them together in one set and did the same with the other five. 
02Ex 36:11 They made loops of blue cloth on the edge of the outside piece in each set. 
02Ex 36:12 They put fifty loops on the first piece of the first set and fifty loops matching them on the last piece of the second set. 
02Ex 36:13 They made fifty gold hooks, with which to join the two sets into one piece. 
02Ex 36:14 Then they made a cover for the Tent out of eleven pieces of cloth made of goats' hair. 
02Ex 36:15 They made them all the same size, 15 yards long and 2 yards wide. 
02Ex 36:16 They sewed five of them together in one set and the other six in another set. 
02Ex 36:17 They put fifty loops on the edge of the last piece of one set and fifty loops on the edge of the other set. 
02Ex 36:18 They made fifty bronze hooks to join the two sets, so as to form one cover. 
02Ex 36:19 They made two more coverings, one of rams' skin dyed red and the other of fine leather, to serve as an outer cover. 
02Ex 36:20 They made upright frames of acacia wood for the Tent. 
02Ex 36:21 Each frame was 15 feet tall and 27 inches wide, 
02Ex 36:22 with two matching projections, so that the frames could be joined together. All the frames had these projections. 
02Ex 36:23 They made twenty frames for the south side 
02Ex 36:24 and forty silver bases to go under them, two bases under each frame to hold its two projections. 
02Ex 36:25 They made twenty frames for the north side of the Tent 
02Ex 36:26 and forty silver bases, two under each frame. 
02Ex 36:27 For the back of the Tent, on the west, they made six frames 
02Ex 36:28 and two frames for the corners. 
02Ex 36:29 These corner frames were joined at the bottom and connected all the way to the top. The two frames that formed the two corners were made in this way. 
02Ex 36:30 So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases, two under each frame. 
02Ex 36:31 They made fifteen crossbars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of the Tent, 
02Ex 36:32 five for the frames on the other side, and five for the frames on the west end, at the back. 
02Ex 36:33 The middle crossbar, set halfway up the frames, extended from one end of the Tent to the other. 
02Ex 36:34 They covered the frames with gold and fitted them with gold rings to hold the crossbars, which were also covered with gold. 
02Ex 36:35 They made a curtain of fine linen, woven with blue, purple, and red wool and embroidered it with figures of winged creatures. 
02Ex 36:36 They made four posts of acacia wood to hold the curtain, covered them with gold, and fitted them with gold hooks. Then they made four silver bases to hold the posts. 
02Ex 36:37 For the entrance of the Tent they made a curtain of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and decorated with embroidery. 
02Ex 36:38 For this curtain they made five posts fitted with hooks, covered their tops and their rods with gold, and made five bronze bases for the posts. 
02Ex 37:1 Bezalel made the Covenant Box out of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 37:2 He covered it with pure gold inside and out and put a gold border all around it. 
02Ex 37:3 He made four carrying rings of gold for it and attached them to its four feet, with two rings on each side. 
02Ex 37:4 He made carrying poles of acacia wood, covered them with gold, 
02Ex 37:5 and put them through the rings on each side of the Box. 
02Ex 37:6 He made a lid of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. 
02Ex 37:7 He made two winged creatures of hammered gold, 
02Ex 37:8 one for each end of the lid. He made them so that they formed one piece with the lid. 
02Ex 37:9 The winged creatures faced each other across the lid, and their outspread wings covered it. 
02Ex 37:10 He made the table out of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 37:11 He covered it with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 
02Ex 37:12 He made a rim 3 inches wide around it and put a gold border around the rim. 
02Ex 37:13 He made four carrying rings of gold for it and put them at the four corners, where the legs were. 
02Ex 37:14 The rings to hold the poles for carrying the table were placed near the rim. 
02Ex 37:15 He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold. 
02Ex 37:16 He made the dishes of pure gold for the table£º the plates, the cups, the jars, and the bowls to be used for the wine offering. 
02Ex 37:17 He made the lampstand of pure gold. He made its base and its shaft of hammered gold; its decorative flowers, including buds and petals, formed one piece with it. 
02Ex 37:18 Six branches extended from its sides, three from each side. 
02Ex 37:19 Each of the six branches had three decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02Ex 37:20 The shaft of the lampstand had four decorative flowers shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals. 
02Ex 37:21 There was one bud below each of the three pairs of branches. 
02Ex 37:22 The buds, the branches, and the lampstand were a single piece of pure hammered gold. 
02Ex 37:23 He made seven lamps for the lampstand, and he made its tongs and trays of pure gold. 
02Ex 37:24 He used seventy-five pounds of pure gold to make the lampstand and all its equipment. 
02Ex 37:25 He made an altar out of acacia wood, for burning incense. It was square, 18 inches long and 18 inches wide, and it was 36 inches high. Its projections at the four corners formed one piece with it. 
02Ex 37:26 He covered its top, all four sides, and its projections with pure gold and put a gold border around it. 
02Ex 37:27 He made two gold carrying rings for it and attached them below the border on the two sides, to hold the poles with which it was to be carried. 
02Ex 37:28 He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold. 
02Ex 37:29 He also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure sweet-smelling incense, mixed like perfume. 
02Ex 38:1 For burning offerings, he made an altar out of acacia wood. It was square, 7 1/2 feet long and 7 1/2 feet wide, and it was 4 1/2 feet high. 
02Ex 38:2 He made the projections at the top of the four corners, so that they formed one piece with the altar. He covered it all with bronze. 
02Ex 38:3 He also made all the equipment for the altar£º the pans, the shovels, the bowls, the hooks, and the fire pans. All this equipment was made of bronze. 
02Ex 38:4 He made a bronze grating and put it under the rim of the altar, so that it reached halfway up the altar. 
02Ex 38:5 He made four carrying rings and put them on the four corners. 
02Ex 38:6 He made carrying poles of acacia wood, covered them with bronze, 
02Ex 38:7 and put them in the rings on each side of the altar. The altar was made of boards and was hollow. 
02Ex 38:8 He made the bronze basin and its bronze base out of the mirrors belonging to the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
02Ex 38:9 For the Tent of the LORD's presence he made the enclosure out of fine linen curtains. On the south side the curtains were 50 yards long, 
02Ex 38:10 supported by twenty bronze posts in twenty bronze bases, with hooks and rods made of silver. 
02Ex 38:11 The enclosure was the same on the north side. 
02Ex 38:12 On the west side there were curtains 25 yards long, with ten posts and ten bases and with hooks and rods made of silver. 
02Ex 38:13 On the east side, where the entrance was, the enclosure was also 25 yards wide. 
02Ex 38:14 On each side of the entrance there were 7 1/2 yards of curtains,
02Ex 38:15 with three posts and three bases.
02Ex 38:16 All the curtains around the enclosure were made of fine linen. 
02Ex 38:17 The bases for the posts were made of bronze, and the hooks, the rods, and the covering of the tops of the posts were made of silver. All the posts around the enclosure were connected with silver rods. 
02Ex 38:18 The curtain for the entrance of the enclosure was made of fine linen woven with blue, purple, and red wool and decorated with embroidery. It was 10 yards long and 2 1/2 yards high, like the curtains of the enclosure. 
02Ex 38:19 It was supported by four posts in four bronze bases. Their hooks, the covering of their tops, and their rods were made of silver.

02Ex 38:21 Here is a list of the amounts of the metals used in the Tent of the LORD's presence, where the two stone tablets were kept on which the Ten Commandments were written. The list was ordered by Moses and made by the Levites who worked under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.

02Ex 39:9 It was square and folded double, 9 inches long and 9 inches wide. 
02Ex 39:10 They mounted four rows of precious stones on it£º in the first row they mounted a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet;

02Ex 39:13 and in the fourth row, a beryl, a carnelian, and a jasper. These were mounted in gold settings. 
02Ex 39:14 Each of the twelve stones had engraved on it the name of one of the sons of Jacob, in order to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. 
02Ex 39:15 For the breastpiece they made chains of pure gold, twisted like cords. 
02Ex 39:16 They made two gold settings and two gold rings and attached the two rings to the upper corners of the breastpiece. 
02Ex 39:17 They fastened the two gold cords to the two rings 
02Ex 39:18 and fastened the other two ends of the cords to the two settings and in this way attached them in front to the shoulder straps of the ephod. 
02Ex 39:19 They made two rings of gold and attached them to the lower corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod. 
02Ex 39:20 They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower part of the front of the two shoulder straps of the ephod, near the seam and above the finely woven belt. 
02Ex 39:21 Just as the LORD had commanded Moses, they tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that the breastpiece rested above the belt and did not come loose.

02Ex 39:32 All the work on the Tent of the LORD's presence was finally completed. The Israelites made everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02Ex 39:33 They brought to Moses the Tent and all its equipment, its hooks, its frames, its crossbars, its posts, and its bases; 
02Ex 39:34 the covering of rams' skin dyed red; the covering of fine leather; the curtain; 
02Ex 39:35 the Covenant Box containing the stone tablets, its poles, and its lid;

02Ex 39:41 and the magnificent garments the priests were to wear in the Holy Place - the sacred clothes for Aaron the priest and for his sons. 
02Ex 39:42 The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
02Ex 39:43 Moses examined everything and saw that they had made it all just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them. 
02Ex 40:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
02Ex 40:2 "On the first day of the first month set up the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
02Ex 40:3 Place in it the Covenant Box containing the Ten Commandments and put the curtain in front of it. 
02Ex 40:4 Bring in the table and place the equipment on it. Also bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps on it. 
02Ex 40:5 Put the gold altar for burning incense in front of the Covenant Box and hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tent. 
02Ex 40:6 Put in front of the Tent the altar for burning offerings. 
02Ex 40:7 Put the washbasin between the Tent and the altar and fill it with water. 
02Ex 40:8 Put up the surrounding enclosure and hang the curtain at its entrance. 
02Ex 40:9 "Then dedicate the Tent and all its equipment by anointing it with the sacred oil, and it will be holy. 
02Ex 40:10 Next, dedicate the altar and all its equipment by anointing it, and it will be completely holy. 
02Ex 40:11 Also dedicate the washbasin and its base in the same way. 
02Ex 40:12 "Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent, and have them take a ritual bath. 
02Ex 40:13 Dress Aaron in the priestly garments, anoint him, and in this way consecrate him, so that he can serve me as priest. 
02Ex 40:14 Bring his sons and put the shirts on them. 
02Ex 40:15 Then anoint them, just as you anointed their father, so that they can serve me as priests. This anointing will make them priests for all time to come." 
02Ex 40:16 Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:17 So on the first day of the first month of the second year after they left Egypt, the Tent of the LORD's presence was set up. 
02Ex 40:18 Moses put down its bases, set up its frames, attached its crossbars, and put up its posts. 
02Ex 40:19 He spread out the covering over the Tent and put the outer covering over it, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:20 Then he took the two stone tablets and put them in the Covenant Box. He put the poles in the rings of the Box and put the lid on it. 
02Ex 40:21 Then he put the Box in the Tent and hung up the curtain. In this way he screened off the Covenant Box, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:22 He put the table in the Tent, on the north side outside the curtain, 
02Ex 40:23 and placed on it the bread offered to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:24 He put the lampstand in the Tent, on the south side, opposite the table, 
02Ex 40:25 and there in the LORD's presence he lit the lamps, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:26 He put the gold altar in the Tent, in front of the curtain, 
02Ex 40:27 and burned the sweet-smelling incense, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:28 He hung the curtain at the entrance of the Tent, 
02Ex 40:29 and there in front of the curtain he placed the altar for burning offerings. On it he sacrificed the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:30 He put the washbasin between the Tent and the altar and filled it with water. 
02Ex 40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there 
02Ex 40:32 whenever they went into the Tent or to the altar, just as the LORD had commanded. 
02Ex 40:33 Moses set up the enclosure around the Tent and the altar and hung the curtain at the entrance of the enclosure. So he finished all the work. 
02Ex 40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent and the dazzling light of the LORD's presence filled it. 
02Ex 40:35 Because of this, Moses could not go into the Tent. 
02Ex 40:36 The Israelites moved their camp to another place only when the cloud lifted from the Tent. 
02Ex 40:37 As long as the cloud stayed there, they did not move their camp. 
02Ex 40:38 During all their wanderings they could see the cloud of the LORD's presence over the Tent during the day and a fire burning above it during the night.

03Lv 1:6 Then you shall skin the animal and cut it up, 
03Lv 1:7 and the priests shall arrange firewood on the altar and light it. 
03Lv 1:8 They shall put on the fire the pieces of the animal, including the head and the fat.

03Lv 2:12 An offering of the first grain that you harvest each year shall be brought to the LORD, but it is not to be burned on the altar. 
03Lv 2:13 Put salt on every grain offering, because salt represents the covenant between you and God. (You must put salt on all your offerings.) 
03Lv 2:14 When you bring to the LORD an offering of the first grain harvested, offer roasted grain or ground meal. 
03Lv 2:15 Add olive oil and put incense on it.

03Lv 3:11 The officiating priest shall burn all this on the altar as a food offering to the LORD. 
03Lv 3:12 If you offer a goat, 
03Lv 3:13 you shall put your hand on its head and kill it in front of the Tent. The priests shall throw its blood against all four sides of the altar 
03Lv 3:14 and present the following parts as a food offering to the LORD£º all the fat on the internal organs,

03Lv 4:1 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 4:2 to tell the people of Israel that anyone who sinned and broke any of the LORD's commands without intending to, would have to observe the following rules. 
03Lv 4:3 If it is the High Priest who sins and so brings guilt on the people, he shall present a young bull without any defects and sacrifice it to the LORD for his sin. 
03Lv 4:4 He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent, put his hand on its head, and kill it there in the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 4:5 Then the High Priest shall take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tent. 
03Lv 4:6 He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it in front of the sacred curtain seven times. 
03Lv 4:7 Then he shall put some of the blood on the projections at the corners of the incense altar in the Tent. He shall pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar used for burning sacrifices, which is at the entrance of the Tent. 
03Lv 4:8 From this bull he shall take all the fat, the fat on the internal organs,

03Lv 4:10 The priest shall take this fat and burn it on the altar used for the burnt offerings, just as he does with the fat from the animal killed for the fellowship offering. 
03Lv 4:11 But he shall take its skin, all its flesh, its head, its legs, and its internal organs, including the intestines, 
03Lv 4:12 carry it all outside the camp to the ritually clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he shall burn it on a wood fire. 
03Lv 4:13 If it is the whole community of Israel that sins and becomes guilty of breaking one of the LORD's commands without intending to, 
03Lv 4:14 then as soon as the sin becomes known, the community shall bring a young bull as a sin offering. They shall bring it to the Tent of the LORD's presence;

03Lv 4:23 then as soon as the sin is called to his attention, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without any defects.

03Lv 6:2 An offering is to be made if any of you sin against the LORD by refusing to return what another Israelite has left as a deposit or by stealing something from him or by cheating him

03Lv 6:4 When you sin in any of these ways, you must repay whatever you got by dishonest means.

03Lv 6:7 The priest shall offer the sacrifice for your sin, and you will be forgiven. 
03Lv 6:8 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 6:9 to give Aaron and his sons the following regulations for burnt offerings. A burnt offering is to be left on the altar all night long, and the fire is to be kept burning. 
03Lv 6:10 Then the priest, wearing his linen robe and linen shorts, shall remove the greasy ashes left on the altar and put them at the side of the altar. 
03Lv 6:11 Then he shall change his clothes and take the ashes outside the camp to a ritually clean place.

03Lv 6:13 The fire must always be kept burning on the altar and never allowed to go out. 
03Lv 6:14 The following are the regulations for grain offerings. An Aaronite priest shall present the grain offering to the LORD in front of the altar. 
03Lv 6:15 Then he shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and the incense on it, and burn it on the altar as a token that all of it has been offered to the LORD. The odor of this offering is pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 6:16 The priests shall eat the rest of it. It shall be made into bread baked without yeast and eaten in a holy place, the courtyard of the Tent of the LORD's presence. The LORD has given it to the priests as their part of the food offerings.
03Lv 6:17 It is very holy, like the sin offerings and the repayment offerings.
03Lv 6:18 For all time to come any of the male descendants of Aaron may eat it as their continuing share of the food offered to the LORD. Anyone else who touches a food offering will be harmed by the power of its holiness. 
03Lv 6:19 The LORD gave Moses the following regulations 
03Lv 6:20 for the ordination of an Aaronite priest. On the day he is ordained, he shall present as an offering to the LORD two pounds of flour (the same amount as the daily grain offering), half in the morning and half in the evening. 
03Lv 6:21 It is to be mixed with oil and cooked on a griddle and then crumbled and presented as a grain offering, an odor pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 6:22 For all time to come this offering is to be made by every descendant of Aaron who is serving as High Priest. It shall be completely burned as a sacrifice to the LORD. 
03Lv 6:23 No part of a grain offering that a priest makes may be eaten; all of it must be burned. 
03Lv 6:24 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 6:25 to give Aaron and his sons the following regulations for sin offerings. The animal for a sin offering shall be killed on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. This is a very holy offering. 
03Lv 6:26 The priest who sacrifices the animal shall eat it in a holy place, the courtyard of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 6:27 Anyone or anything that touches the flesh of the animal will be harmed by the power of its holiness. If any article of clothing is spattered with the animal's blood, it must be washed in a holy place. 
03Lv 6:28 Any clay pot in which the meat is boiled must be broken, and if a metal pot is used, it must be scrubbed and rinsed with water. 
03Lv 6:29 Any male of the priestly families may eat this offering; it is very holy. 
03Lv 6:30 But if any of the blood is brought into the Tent and used in the ritual to take away sin, the animal must not be eaten; it must be burned. 
03Lv 7:1 The following are the regulations for repayment offerings, which are very holy. 
03Lv 7:2 The animal for this offering is to be killed on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed, and its blood is to be thrown against all four sides of the altar. 
03Lv 7:3 All of its fat shall be removed and offered on the altar£º the fat tail, the fat covering the internal organs, 
03Lv 7:4 the kidneys and the fat on them, and the best part of the liver. 
03Lv 7:5 The priest shall burn all the fat on the altar as a food offering to the LORD. It is a repayment offering. 
03Lv 7:6 Any male of the priestly families may eat it, but it must be eaten in a holy place, because it is very holy. 
03Lv 7:7 There is one regulation that applies to both the sin offering and the repayment offering£º the meat belongs to the priest who offers the sacrifice. 
03Lv 7:8 The skin of an animal offered as a burnt offering belongs to the priest who offers the sacrifice. 
03Lv 7:9 Every grain offering that has been baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who has offered it to God. 
03Lv 7:10 But all uncooked grain offerings, whether mixed with oil or dry, belong to all the Aaronite priests and must be shared equally among them. 
03Lv 7:11 The following are the regulations for the fellowship offerings presented to the LORD. 
03Lv 7:12 If you make this offering as a thanksgiving offering to God, you shall present, together with the animal to be sacrificed, an offering of bread made without yeast£º either thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil or thin cakes brushed with olive oil or cakes made of flour mixed with olive oil. 
03Lv 7:13 In addition, you shall offer loaves of bread baked with yeast. 
03Lv 7:14 You shall present one part of each kind of bread as a special contribution to the LORD; it belongs to the priest who takes the blood of the animal and throws it against the altar. 
03Lv 7:15 The flesh of the animal must be eaten on the day it is sacrificed; none of it may be left until the next morning. 
03Lv 7:16 If you bring a fellowship offering as fulfillment of a vow or as your own freewill offering, not all of it has to be eaten on the day it is offered, but any that is left over may be eaten on the following day. 
03Lv 7:17 Any meat that still remains on the third day must be burned. 
03Lv 7:18 If any of it is eaten on the third day, God will not accept your offering. The offering will not be counted to your credit but will be considered unclean, and whoever eats it will suffer the consequences. 
03Lv 7:19 If the meat comes into contact with anything ritually unclean, it must not be eaten, but must be burned. Any of you that are ritually clean may eat the meat, 
03Lv 7:20 but if any of you who are not clean eat it, you shall no longer be considered one of God's people. 
03Lv 7:21 Also, if you eat the meat of this offering after you have touched anything ritually unclean, whether from a person or an animal, you shall no longer be considered one of God's people. 
03Lv 7:22 The LORD gave Moses the following regulations 
03Lv 7:23 for the people of Israel. No fat of cattle, sheep, or goats shall be eaten. 
03Lv 7:24 The fat of an animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by a wild animal must not be eaten, but it may be used for any other purpose. 
03Lv 7:25 Anyone who eats the fat of an animal that may be offered as a food offering to the LORD will no longer be considered one of God's people. 
03Lv 7:26 No matter where the Israelites live, they must never use the blood of birds or animals for food. 
03Lv 7:27 Anyone who breaks this law will no longer be considered one of God's people. 
03Lv 7:28 The LORD gave Moses the following regulations 
03Lv 7:29 for the people of Israel. When any of you offer a fellowship offering you must bring part of it as a special gift to the LORD, 
03Lv 7:30 bringing it with your own hands as a food offering. You shall bring the fat of the animal with its breast and present it as a special gift to the LORD. 
03Lv 7:31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall belong to the priests. 
03Lv 7:32 The right hind leg of the animal shall be given as a special contribution 
03Lv 7:33 to the priest who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering. 
03Lv 7:34 The breast of the animal is a special gift, and the right hind leg is a special contribution that the LORD has taken from the people of Israel and given to the priests. This is what the people of Israel must give to the priests for all time to come. 
03Lv 7:35 This is the part of the food offered to the LORD that was given to Aaron and his sons on the day they were ordained as priests. 
03Lv 7:36 On that day the LORD commanded the people of Israel to give them this part of the offering. It is a regulation that the people of Israel must obey for all time to come. 
03Lv 7:37 These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, the sin offerings, the repayment offerings, the ordination offerings, and the fellowship offerings. 
03Lv 7:38 There on Mount Sinai in the desert, the LORD gave these commands to Moses on the day he told the people of Israel to make their offerings. 
03Lv 8:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
03Lv 8:2 "Take Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of my presence and bring the priestly garments, the anointing oil, the young bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread. 
03Lv 8:3 Then call the whole community together there." 
03Lv 8:4 Moses did as the LORD had commanded, and when the community had assembled, 
03Lv 8:5 he said to them, "What I am now about to do is what the LORD has commanded." 
03Lv 8:6 Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and had them take a ritual bath. 
03Lv 8:7 He put the shirt and the robe on Aaron and the sash around his waist. He put the ephod on him and fastened it by putting its finely woven belt around his waist. 
03Lv 8:8 He put the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in it. 
03Lv 8:9 He placed the turban on his head, and on the front of it he put the gold ornament, the sacred sign of dedication, just as the LORD had commanded him. 
03Lv 8:10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and put it on the Tent of the LORD's presence and everything that was in it, and in this way he dedicated it all to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:11 He took some of the oil and sprinkled it seven times on the altar and its equipment and on the basin and its base, in order to dedicate them to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:12 He ordained Aaron by pouring some of the anointing oil on his head. 
03Lv 8:13 Next, Moses brought the sons of Aaron forward and put shirts on them, put sashes around their waists, and tied caps on their heads, just as the LORD had commanded. 
03Lv 8:14 Then Moses brought the young bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 
03Lv 8:15 Moses killed it and took some of the blood, and with his finger put it on the projections at the corners of the altar, in order to dedicate it. He then poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. In this way he dedicated it and purified it. 
03Lv 8:16 Moses took all the fat on the internal organs, the best part of the liver, and the kidneys with the fat on them, and burned it all on the altar. 
03Lv 8:17 He took the rest of the bull, including its skin, flesh, and intestines, and burned it outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded. 
03Lv 8:18 Next, Moses brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 
03Lv 8:19 Moses killed it and threw the blood on all four sides of the altar. 
03Lv 8:20 He cut the ram in pieces, washed the internal organs and the hind legs with water, and burned the head, the fat, and all the rest of the ram on the altar, just as the LORD had commanded.
03Lv 8:21 This burnt offering was a food offering, and its odor was pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:22 Then Moses brought the second ram, which was for the ordination of priests, and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head. 
03Lv 8:23 Moses killed it and took some of the blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 
03Lv 8:24 Then he brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Moses then threw the rest of the blood on all four sides of the altar. 
03Lv 8:25 He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat covering the internal organs, the best part of the liver, the kidneys with the fat on them, and the right hind leg. 
03Lv 8:26 Then he took one loaf of bread from the basket of unleavened bread dedicated to the LORD, one loaf made with oil, and one thin cake, and he put them on top of the fat and the right hind leg. 
03Lv 8:27 He put all of this food in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they presented it as a special gift to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:28 Then Moses took the food from them and burned it on the altar, on top of the burnt offering, as an ordination offering. This was a food offering, and its odor was pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:29 Then Moses took the breast and presented it as a special gift to the LORD. It was Moses' part of the ordination ram. Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded. 
03Lv 8:30 Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his sons and on their clothes. In this way he consecrated them and their clothes to the LORD. 
03Lv 8:31 Moses said to Aaron and his sons, "Take the meat to the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence, boil it, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, just as the LORD commanded. 
03Lv 8:32 Burn up any meat or bread that is left over. 
03Lv 8:33 You shall not leave the entrance of the Tent for seven days, until your ordination rites are completed. 
03Lv 8:34 The LORD commanded us to do what we have done today, in order to take away your sin. 
03Lv 8:35 You must stay at the entrance of the Tent day and night for seven days, doing what the LORD has commanded. If you don't, you will die. This is what the LORD has commanded me." 
03Lv 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
03Lv 9:1 The day after the ordination rites were completed, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the leaders of Israel. 
03Lv 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a young bull and a ram without any defects and offer them to the LORD, the bull for a sin offering and the ram for a burnt offering. 
03Lv 9:3 Then tell the people of Israel to take a male goat for a sin offering, a one-year-old calf, and a one-year-old lamb without any defects for a burnt offering, 
03Lv 9:4 and a bull and a ram for a fellowship offering. They are to sacrifice them to the LORD with the grain offering mixed with oil. They must do this because the LORD will appear to them today." 
03Lv 9:5 They brought to the front of the Tent everything that Moses had commanded, and the whole community assembled there to worship the LORD. 
03Lv 9:6 Moses said, "The LORD has commanded you to do all this, so that the dazzling light of his presence can appear to you." 
03Lv 9:7 Then he said to Aaron, "Go to the altar and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering to take away your sins and the sins of the people. Present this offering to take away the sins of the people, just as the LORD commanded." 
03Lv 9:8 Aaron went to the altar and killed the young bull which was for his own sin offering. 
03Lv 9:9 His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it, put some of it on the projections at the corners of the altar, and poured out the rest of it at the base of the altar. 
03Lv 9:10 Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the best part of the liver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03Lv 9:11 But he burned the meat and the skin outside the camp. 
03Lv 9:12 He killed the animal which was for his own burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar. 
03Lv 9:13 They handed him the head and the other pieces of the animal, and he burned them on the altar. 
03Lv 9:14 Then he washed the internal organs and the hind legs and burned them on the altar on top of the rest of the burnt offering. 
03Lv 9:15 After that, he presented the people's offerings. He took the goat that was to be offered for the people's sins, killed it, and offered it, as he had done with his own sin offering. 
03Lv 9:16 He also brought the animal for the burnt offering and offered it according to the regulations. 
03Lv 9:17 He presented the grain offering and took a handful of flour and burned it on the altar. (This was in addition to the daily burnt offering.) 
03Lv 9:18 He killed the bull and the ram as a fellowship offering for the people. His sons brought him the blood, and he threw it on all four sides of the altar. 
03Lv 9:19 Aaron put the fat parts of the bull and the ram 
03Lv 9:20 on top of the breasts of the animals and carried it all to the altar. He burned the fat on the altar 
03Lv 9:21 and presented the breasts and the right hind legs as the special gift to the LORD for the priests, as Moses had commanded. 
03Lv 9:22 When Aaron had finished all the sacrifices, he raised his hands over the people and blessed them, and then stepped down. 
03Lv 9:23 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of the LORD's presence, and when they came out, they blessed the people, and the dazzling light of the LORD's presence appeared to all the people. 
03Lv 9:24 Suddenly the LORD sent a fire, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar. When the people saw it, they all shouted and bowed down with their faces to the ground. 
03Lv 10:1 Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan, put live coals in it, added incense, and presented it to the LORD. But this fire was not holy, because the LORD had not commanded them to present it. 
03Lv 10:2 Suddenly the LORD sent fire, and it burned them to death there in the presence of the LORD. 
03Lv 10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD was speaking about when he said, 'All who serve me must respect my holiness; I will reveal my glory to my people.' " But Aaron remained silent. 
03Lv 10:4 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, "Come here and carry your cousins' bodies away from the sacred Tent and put them outside the camp." 
03Lv 10:5 So they came and took hold of the clothing on the corpses and carried them outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded. 
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not leave your hair uncombed or tear your clothes to show that you are in mourning. If you do, you will die, and the LORD will be angry with the whole community. But all other Israelites are allowed to mourn this death caused by the fire which the LORD sent. 
03Lv 10:7 Do not leave the entrance of the Tent or you will die, because you have been consecrated by the anointing oil of the LORD." So they did as Moses said. 
03Lv 10:8 The LORD said to Aaron, 
03Lv 10:9 "You and your sons are not to enter the Tent of my presence after drinking wine or beer; if you do, you will die. This is a law to be kept by all your descendants. 
03Lv 10:10 You must distinguish between what belongs to God and what is for general use, between what is ritually clean and what is unclean. 
03Lv 10:11 You must teach the people of Israel all the laws which I have given to you through Moses." 
03Lv 10:12 Moses said to Aaron and his two remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering that is left over from the food offered to the LORD, make unleavened bread with it and eat it beside the altar, because this offering is very holy. 
03Lv 10:13 Eat it in a holy place; it is the part that belongs to you and your sons from the food offered to the LORD. That is what the LORD commanded me. 
03Lv 10:14 But you and your families may eat the breast and the hind leg that are presented as the special gift and the special contribution to the LORD for the priests. You may eat them in any ritually clean place. These offerings have been given to you and your children as the part that belongs to you from the fellowship offerings of the people of Israel. 
03Lv 10:15 They shall bring the hind leg and the breast at the time the fat is presented as a food offering to the LORD. These parts belong to you and your children forever, just as the LORD commanded." 
03Lv 10:16 Moses asked about the goat for the sin offering and learned that it had already been burned. This made him angry at Eleazar and Ithamar, and he demanded, 
03Lv 10:17 "Why didn't you eat the sin offering in a sacred place? It is very holy, and the LORD has given it to you in order to take away the sin of the community. 
03Lv 10:18 Since its blood was not brought into the sacred Tent, you should have eaten the sacrifice there, as I commanded." 
03Lv 10:19 Aaron answered, "If I had eaten the sin offering today, would the LORD have approved? The people presented their sin offering to the LORD today, and they brought their burnt offering, but still these terrible things have happened to me." 
03Lv 10:20 When Moses heard this, he was satisfied. 
03Lv 11:1 The LORD gave Moses and Aaron the following regulations 
03Lv 11:2 for the people of Israel. You may eat any land animal 
03Lv 11:3 that has divided hoofs and that also chews the cud, 
03Lv 11:4 but you must not eat camels, rock badgers, or rabbits.
03Lv 11:5 These must be considered unclean;
03Lv 11:6 they chew the cud, but do not have divided hoofs. 
03Lv 11:7 Do not eat pigs. They must be considered unclean; they have divided hoofs, but do not chew the cud. 
03Lv 11:8 Do not eat these animals or even touch their dead bodies; they are unclean. 
03Lv 11:9 You may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales, 
03Lv 11:10 but anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales must not be eaten. 
03Lv 11:11 Such creatures must be considered unclean. You must not eat them or even touch their dead bodies. 
03Lv 11:12 You must not eat anything that lives in the water and does not have fins and scales. 
03Lv 11:13 You must not eat any of the following birds£º eagles, owls, hawks, falcons;
03Lv 11:14 buzzards, vultures,
03Lv 11:15 crows;

03Lv 11:17 storks,
03Lv 11:18 herons, pelicans, cormorants;
03Lv 11:19 hoopoes; or bats.
03Lv 11:20 All winged insects are unclean, 
03Lv 11:21 except those that hop. 
03Lv 11:22 You may eat locusts, crickets, or grasshoppers. 
03Lv 11:23 But all other small things that have wings and also crawl must be considered unclean. 
03Lv 11:24 If you touch the dead bodies of the following animals, you will be unclean until evening£º
03Lv 11:25 all animals with hoofs,
03Lv 11:26 unless their hoofs are divided and they chew the cud,
03Lv 11:27 and all four-footed animals with paws.
03Lv 11:28 If you carry their dead bodies, you must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening.
03Lv 11:29 Moles, rats, mice,
03Lv 11:30 and lizards must be considered unclean. 
03Lv 11:31 Whoever touches them or their dead bodies will be unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:32 And if their dead bodies fall on anything, it will be unclean. This applies to any article of wood, cloth, leather, or sacking, no matter what it is used for. It shall be dipped in water, but it will remain unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:33 And if their bodies fall into a clay pot, everything that is in it shall be unclean, and you must break the pot. 
03Lv 11:34 Any food which could normally be eaten, but on which water from such a pot has been poured, will be unclean, and anything drinkable in such a pot is unclean. 
03Lv 11:35 Anything on which the dead bodies fall is unclean; a clay stove or oven shall be broken, 
03Lv 11:36 but a spring or a cistern remains clean, although anything else that touches their dead bodies is unclean. 
03Lv 11:37 If one of them falls on seed that is going to be planted, the seed remains clean. 
03Lv 11:38 But if the seed is soaking in water and one of them falls on it, the seed is unclean. 
03Lv 11:39 If any animal that may be eaten dies, anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:40 And if any of you eat any part of the animal, you must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening; any of you who carry the dead body must wash your clothes, but you will still be unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:41 You must not eat any of the small animals that move on the ground, 
03Lv 11:42 whether they crawl, or walk on four legs, or have many legs. 
03Lv 11:43 Do not make yourselves unclean by eating any of these. 
03Lv 11:44 I am the LORD your God, and you must keep yourselves holy, because I am holy. 
03Lv 11:45 I am the LORD who brought you out of Egypt so that I could be your God. You must be holy, because I am holy. 
03Lv 11:46 This, then, is the law about animals and birds, about everything that lives in the water, and everything that moves on the ground. 
03Lv 11:47 You must be careful to distinguish between what is ritually clean and unclean, between animals that may be eaten and those that may not. 
03Lv 12:1 The LORD gave Moses the following regulations 
03Lv 12:2 for the people of Israel. For seven days after a woman gives birth to a son, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period. 
03Lv 12:3 On the eighth day, the child shall be circumcised. 
03Lv 12:4 Then it will be thirty-three more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood; she must not touch anything that is holy or enter the sacred Tent until the time of her purification is completed. 
03Lv 12:5 For fourteen days after a woman gives birth to a daughter, she is ritually unclean, as she is during her monthly period. Then it will be sixty-six more days until she is ritually clean from her loss of blood. 
03Lv 12:6 When the time of her purification is completed, whether for a son or daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence a one-year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering. 
03Lv 12:7 The priest shall present her offering to the LORD and perform the ritual to take away her impurity, and she will be ritually clean. This, then, is what a woman must do after giving birth. 
03Lv 12:8 If the woman cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two doves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering, and the priest shall perform the ritual to take away her impurity, and she will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:1 The LORD gave Moses and Aaron these regulations. 
03Lv 13:2 If any of you have a sore on your skin or a boil or an inflammation which could develop into a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the Aaronite priest. 
03Lv 13:3 The priest shall examine the sore, and if the hairs in it have turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
03Lv 13:4 But if the sore is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin around it and the hairs have not turned white, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
03Lv 13:5 The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if in his opinion the sore looks the same and has not spread, he shall isolate you for another seven days. 
03Lv 13:6 The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if the sore has faded and has not spread, he shall pronounce you ritually clean; it is only a sore. You shall wash your clothes and be ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:7 But if the sore spreads after the priest has examined you and pronounced you clean, you must appear before the priest again. 
03Lv 13:8 The priest will examine you again, and if it has spread, he shall pronounce you unclean; it is a dreaded skin disease. 
03Lv 13:9 If any of you have a dreaded skin disease, you shall be brought to the priest, 
03Lv 13:10 who will examine you. If there is a white sore on your skin which turns the hairs white and is full of pus, 
03Lv 13:11 it is a chronic skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you unclean; there is no need to isolate you, because you are obviously unclean. 
03Lv 13:12 If the skin disease spreads and covers you from head to foot, 
03Lv 13:13 the priest shall examine you again. If he finds that it actually has covered the whole body, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. If your whole skin has turned white, you are ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:14 But from the moment an open sore appears, you are unclean. 
03Lv 13:15 The priest shall examine you again, and if he sees an open sore, he shall pronounce you unclean. An open sore means a dreaded skin disease, and you are unclean. 
03Lv 13:16 But when the sore heals and becomes white again, you shall go to the priest, 
03Lv 13:17 who will examine you again. If the sore has turned white, you are ritually clean, and the priest shall pronounce you clean. 
03Lv 13:18 If any of you have a boil that has healed 
03Lv 13:19 and if afterward a white swelling or a reddish-white spot appears where the boil was, you shall go to the priest. 
03Lv 13:20 The priest shall examine you, and if the spot seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it have turned white, he shall pronounce you unclean. It is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the boil. 
03Lv 13:21 But if the priest examines it and finds that the hairs in it have not turned white and that it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
03Lv 13:22 If the spot spreads, the priest shall pronounce you unclean; you are diseased. 
03Lv 13:23 But if it remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar left from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:24 In case any of you have been burned, if the raw flesh becomes white or reddish-white, 
03Lv 13:25 the priest shall examine you. If the hairs in the spot have turned white and it appears deeper than the surrounding skin, it is a dreaded skin disease that has started in the burn, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
03Lv 13:26 But if the hairs in it have not turned white and it is not deeper than the surrounding skin, but is light in color, the priest shall isolate you for seven days. 
03Lv 13:27 The priest shall examine you again on the seventh day, and if it is spreading, it is a dreaded skin disease, and the priest shall pronounce you unclean. 
03Lv 13:28 But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread and is light in color, it is not a dreaded skin disease. The priest shall pronounce you ritually clean, because it is only a scar from the burn. 
03Lv 13:29 When any of you, male or female, have a sore on your head or chin, 
03Lv 13:30 the priest shall examine it. If it seems to be deeper than the surrounding skin and the hairs in it are yellowish and thin, it is a dreaded skin disease, and he shall pronounce you unclean. 
03Lv 13:31 If, when the priest examines you, the sore does not appear to be deeper than the surrounding skin, but there are still no healthy hairs in it, he shall isolate you for seven days. 
03Lv 13:32 The priest shall examine the sore again on the seventh day, and if it has not spread and there are no yellowish hairs in it and it does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, 
03Lv 13:33 you shall shave the head except the area around the sore. The priest shall then isolate you for another seven days. 
03Lv 13:34 On the seventh day the priest shall again examine the sore, and if it has not spread and does not seem to be deeper than the surrounding skin, he shall pronounce you ritually clean. You shall wash your clothes, and you will be clean. 
03Lv 13:35 But if the sore spreads after you have been pronounced clean, 
03Lv 13:36 the priest shall examine you again. If the sore has spread, he need not look for yellowish hairs; you are obviously unclean. 
03Lv 13:37 But if in the priest's opinion the sore has not spread and healthy hairs are growing in it, the sore has healed, and the priest shall pronounce you ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:38 When any of you, male or female, have white spots on the skin, 
03Lv 13:39 the priest shall examine you. If the spots are dull white, it is only a blemish that has broken out on the skin; you are ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:40 If you lose your hair at the back or the front of your head,
03Lv 13:41 this does not make you unclean.
03Lv 13:42 But if a reddish-white sore appears on the bald spot, it is a dreaded skin disease. 
03Lv 13:43 The priest shall examine you, and if there is a reddish-white sore, 
03Lv 13:44 the priest shall pronounce you unclean, because of the dreaded skin disease on your head. 
03Lv 13:45 If you have a dreaded skin disease, you must wear torn clothes, leave your hair uncombed, cover the lower part of your face, and call out, "Unclean, unclean!" 
03Lv 13:46 You remain unclean as long as you have the disease, and you must live outside the camp, away from others. 
03Lv 13:47 When there is mildew on clothing, whether wool or linen, 
03Lv 13:48 or on any piece of linen or wool cloth or on leather or anything made of leather, 
03Lv 13:49 if it is greenish or reddish, it is a spreading mildew and must be shown to the priest. 
03Lv 13:50 The priest shall examine it and put the object away for seven days. 
03Lv 13:51 He shall examine it again on the seventh day, and if the mildew has spread, the object is unclean. 
03Lv 13:52 The priest shall burn it, because it is a spreading mildew which must be destroyed by fire. 
03Lv 13:53 But if, when he examines it, the priest finds that the mildew has not spread on the object, 
03Lv 13:54 he shall order that it be washed and put away for another seven days. 
03Lv 13:55 Then he shall examine it, and if the mildew has not changed color, even though it has not spread, it is still unclean; you must burn the object, whether the rot is on the front or the back. 
03Lv 13:56 But if, when the priest examines it again, the mildew has faded, he shall tear it out of the clothing or leather. 
03Lv 13:57 Then, if the mildew reappears, it is spreading again, and the owner shall burn the object. 
03Lv 13:58 If he washes the object and the spot disappears, he shall wash it again, and it will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 13:59 This, then, is the law about mildew on clothing, whether it is wool or linen, or on linen or wool cloth or on anything made of leather; this is how the decision is made as to whether it is ritually clean or unclean. 
03Lv 14:1 The LORD gave Moses 
03Lv 14:2 the following regulations about the ritual purification of those of you cured of a dreaded skin disease. On the day you are to be pronounced clean, you shall be brought to the priest, 
03Lv 14:3 and the priest shall take you outside the camp and examine you. If the disease is healed, 
03Lv 14:4 the priest shall order that two ritually clean birds be brought, along with a piece of cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop. 
03Lv 14:5 Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water. 
03Lv 14:6 He shall take the other bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood, the red cord, and the hyssop, in the blood of the bird that was killed. 
03Lv 14:7 He shall sprinkle the blood seven times on the one of you who is to be purified from your skin disease, and then he shall pronounce you clean. He shall let the live bird fly away over the open fields. 
03Lv 14:8 You shall wash your clothes, shave off all your hair, and take a bath; you will then be ritually clean. You may enter the camp, but you must live outside your tent for seven days. 
03Lv 14:9 On the seventh day you shall again shave your head, your beard, your eyebrows, and all the rest of the hair on your body; you shall wash your clothes and take a bath, and then you will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 14:10 On the eighth day you shall bring two male lambs and one female lamb a year old that are without any defects, five pounds of flour mixed with olive oil, and half a pint of olive oil. 
03Lv 14:11 The priest shall take you and these offerings to the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 14:12 Then the priest shall take one of the male lambs and together with the half pint of oil he shall offer it as a repayment offering. He shall present them as a special gift to the LORD for the priest. 
03Lv 14:13 He shall kill the lamb in the holy place where the animals for the sin offerings and the burnt offerings are killed. He must do this because the repayment offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest and is very holy. 
03Lv 14:14 The priest shall take some of the blood of the lamb and put it on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean. 
03Lv 14:15 The priest shall take some of the olive oil and pour it in the palm of his own left hand, 
03Lv 14:16 dip a finger of his right hand in it, and sprinkle some of it seven times there in the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 14:17 He shall take some of the oil that is in the palm of his hand and some of the blood of the lamb and put them on the lobe of the right ear, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot of the one of you to be declared ritually clean. 
03Lv 14:18 He shall put the rest of the oil that is in the palm of his hand on your head. In this way he shall perform the ritual of purification. 
03Lv 14:19 Then the priest shall offer the sin offering and perform the ritual of purification. After that, he shall kill the animal for the burnt offering 
03Lv 14:20 and offer it with the grain offering on the altar. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification, and you will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 14:21 If you are poor and cannot afford any more, you shall bring for your purification only one male lamb as your repayment offering, a special gift to the LORD for the priest. You shall bring only two pounds of flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering and half a pint of olive oil. 
03Lv 14:22 You shall also bring two doves or two pigeons, one for the sin offering and one for the burnt offering. 
03Lv 14:23 On the eighth day of your purification you shall bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent. 
03Lv 14:24 The priest shall take the lamb and the olive oil and present them as a special gift to the LORD for the priest. 
03Lv 14:25 He shall kill the lamb and take some of the blood and put it on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot. 
03Lv 14:26 The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand 
03Lv 14:27 and with a finger of his right hand sprinkle some of it seven times there in the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 14:28 He shall put some of the oil on the same places he put the blood£º on the lobe of your right ear, on the thumb of your right hand, and on the big toe of your right foot. 
03Lv 14:29 The rest of the oil that is in his palm he shall put on your head and in this way perform the ritual of purification. 
03Lv 14:30 Then he shall offer one of the doves or pigeons 
03Lv 14:31 as the sin offering and the other as the burnt offering with the grain offering. In this way the priest shall perform the ritual of purification. 
03Lv 14:32 This is the law for those who have a dreaded skin disease but who cannot afford the normal offerings required for his purification. 
03Lv 14:33 The LORD gave Moses and Aaron 
03Lv 14:34 the following regulations about houses affected by spreading mildew. (These were to apply after the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan, which the LORD was going to give them as their possession.)
03Lv 14:35 If any of you find that the LORD has sent mildew on your house, then you must go and tell the priest about it. 
03Lv 14:36 The priest shall order everything to be moved out of the house before he goes to examine the mildew; otherwise everything in the house will be declared unclean. Then he shall go to the house 
03Lv 14:37 and examine the mildew. If there are greenish or reddish spots that appear to be eating into the wall, 
03Lv 14:38 he shall leave the house and lock it up for seven days. 
03Lv 14:39 On the seventh day he shall return and examine it again. If the mildew has spread, 
03Lv 14:40 he shall order that the stones on which the mildew is found be removed and thrown into some unclean place outside the city. 
03Lv 14:41 After that he must have all the interior walls scraped and the plaster dumped in an unclean place outside the city. 
03Lv 14:42 Then other stones are to be used to replace the stones that were removed, and new plaster will be used to cover the walls. 
03Lv 14:43 If the mildew breaks out again in the house after the stones have been removed and the house has been scraped and plastered, 
03Lv 14:44 the priest shall go and look. If it has spread, the house is unclean. 
03Lv 14:45 It must be torn down, and its stones, its wood, and all its plaster must be carried out of the city to an unclean place. 
03Lv 14:46 Any who enter the house while it is locked up will be unclean until evening. 
03Lv 14:47 Any who lie down or eat in the house must wash their clothes. 
03Lv 14:48 If, when the priest comes to look, the mildew has not reappeared after the house has been replastered, he shall pronounce the house ritually clean, because the mildew has been completely removed. 
03Lv 14:49 To purify the house, he shall take two birds, some cedar wood, a red cord, and a sprig of hyssop. 
03Lv 14:50 He shall kill one of the birds over a clay bowl containing fresh spring water. 
03Lv 14:51 Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the red cord, and the live bird and shall dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the fresh water. And he shall sprinkle the house seven times. 
03Lv 14:52 In this way he shall purify the house with the bird's blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the red cord. 
03Lv 14:53 Then he shall let the live bird fly away outside the city over the open fields. In this way he shall perform the ritual of purification for the house, and it will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 14:54 These are the laws about dreaded skin diseases; 
03Lv 14:55 sores, boils, or inflammations;
03Lv 14:56 and about mildew in clothes or houses. 
03Lv 14:57 These laws determine when something is unclean and when it is clean. 
03Lv 15:1 The LORD gave Moses and Aaron the following regulations 
03Lv 15:2 for the people of Israel. When any man has a discharge from his penis, the discharge is unclean, 
03Lv 15:3 whether the penis runs with it or is stopped up by it. 
03Lv 15:4 Any bed on which he sits or lies is unclean. 
03Lv 15:5 Anyone who touches his bed 
03Lv 15:6 or sits on anything the man has sat on must wash his clothes and take a bath, and he remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:7 Anyone who touches the man with the discharge must wash his clothes and take a bath, and he remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:8 If the man with the discharge spits on anyone who is ritually clean, that person must wash his clothes and take a bath, and he remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:9 Any saddle or seat on which the man with the discharge sits is unclean. 
03Lv 15:10 Anyone who touches anything on which the man sat is unclean until evening. Anyone who carries anything on which the man sat must wash his clothes and take a bath, and he remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:11 If a man who has a discharge touches one of you without first having washed his hands, you must wash your clothes and take a bath, and you remain unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:12 Any clay pot that the man touches must be broken, and any wooden bowl that he touches must be washed. 
03Lv 15:13 After the man is cured of his discharge, he must wait seven days and then wash his clothes and take a bath in fresh spring water, and he will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 15:14 On the eighth day he shall take two doves or two pigeons to the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence and give them to the priest. 
03Lv 15:15 The priest shall offer one of them as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way he will perform the ritual of purification for the man. 
03Lv 15:16 When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body, and he remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:17 Anything made of cloth or leather on which the semen falls must be washed, and it remains unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:18 After sexual intercourse both the man and the woman must take a bath, and they remain unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:19 When a woman has her monthly period, she remains unclean for seven days. Anyone who touches her is unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:20 Anything on which she sits or lies during her monthly period is unclean. 
03Lv 15:21 Any who touch her bed or anything on which she has sat
03Lv 15:22 must wash their clothes and take a bath,
03Lv 15:23 and they remain unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:24 If a man has sexual intercourse with her during her period, he is contaminated by her impurity and remains unclean for seven days, and any bed on which he lies is unclean. 
03Lv 15:25 If a woman has a flow of blood for several days outside her monthly period or if her flow continues beyond her regular period, she remains unclean as long as the flow continues, just as she is during her monthly period. 
03Lv 15:26 Any bed on which she lies and anything on which she sits during this time is unclean. 
03Lv 15:27 Any who touch them are unclean and must wash their clothes and take a bath; they remain unclean until evening. 
03Lv 15:28 After her flow stops, she must wait seven days, and then she will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 15:29 On the eighth day she shall take two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 15:30 The priest shall offer one of them as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and in this way he will perform the ritual of purification for her. 
03Lv 15:31 The LORD told Moses to warn the people of Israel about their uncleanness, so that they would not defile the Tent of his presence, which was in the middle of the camp. If they did, they would be killed. 
03Lv 15:32 These are the regulations about a man who has a discharge or an emission of semen, 
03Lv 15:33 a woman during her monthly period, or a man who has sexual intercourse with a woman who is ritually unclean. 
03Lv 16:1 The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who were killed when they offered unholy fire to the LORD. 
03Lv 16:2 He said, "Tell your brother Aaron that only at the proper time is he to go behind the curtain into the Most Holy Place, because that is where I appear in a cloud above the lid on the Covenant Box. If he disobeys, he will be killed. 
03Lv 16:3 He may enter the Most Holy Place only after he has brought a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering." 
03Lv 16:4 Then the LORD gave the following instructions. Before Aaron goes into the Most Holy Place, he must take a bath and put on the priestly garments£º the linen robe and shorts, the belt, and the turban. 
03Lv 16:5 The community of Israel shall give Aaron two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 
03Lv 16:6 He shall offer a bull as a sacrifice to take away his own sins and those of his family. 
03Lv 16:7 Then he shall take the two goats to the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 16:8 There he shall draw lots, using two stones, one marked "for the LORD" and the other "for Azazel." 
03Lv 16:9 Aaron shall sacrifice the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and offer it as a sin offering. 
03Lv 16:10 The goat chosen for Azazel shall be presented alive to the LORD and sent off into the desert to Azazel, in order to take away the sins of the people. 
03Lv 16:11 When Aaron sacrifices the bull as the sin offering for himself and his family, 
03Lv 16:12 he shall take a fire pan full of burning coals from the altar and two handfuls of fine incense and bring them into the Most Holy Place. 
03Lv 16:13 There in the LORD's presence he shall put the incense on the fire, and the smoke of the incense will hide the lid of the Covenant Box so that he will not see it and die. 
03Lv 16:14 He shall take some of the bull's blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the lid and then sprinkle some of it seven times in front of the Covenant Box. 
03Lv 16:15 After that, he shall kill the goat for the sin offering for the people, bring its blood into the Most Holy Place, and sprinkle it on the lid and then in front of the Covenant Box, as he did with the bull's blood. 
03Lv 16:16 In this way he will perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place from the uncleanness of the people of Israel and from all their sins. He must do this to the Tent, because it stands in the middle of the camp, which is ritually unclean. 
03Lv 16:17 From the time Aaron enters the Most Holy Place to perform the ritual of purification until he comes out, there must be no one in the Tent. When he has performed the ritual for himself, his family, and the whole community, 
03Lv 16:18 he must then go out to the altar for burnt offerings and purify it. He must take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it all over the projections at the corners of the altar. 
03Lv 16:19 With his finger he must sprinkle some of the blood on the altar seven times. In this way he is to purify it from the sins of the people of Israel and make it holy. 
03Lv 16:20 When Aaron has finished performing the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of the LORD's presence, and the altar, he shall present to the LORD the live goat chosen for Azazel. 
03Lv 16:21 He shall put both of his hands on the goat's head and confess over it all the evils, sins, and rebellions of the people of Israel, and so transfer them to the goat's head. Then the goat is to be driven off into the desert by someone appointed to do it. 
03Lv 16:22 The goat will carry all their sins away with him into some uninhabited land. 
03Lv 16:23 Then Aaron shall go into the Tent, take off the priestly garments that he had put on before entering the Most Holy Place, and leave them there. 
03Lv 16:24 He must take a bath in a holy place and put on his own clothes. After that, he shall go out and offer the burnt offering to remove his own sins and those of the people. 
03Lv 16:25 He shall burn on the altar the fat of the animal for the sin offering. 
03Lv 16:26 The man who drove the goat into the desert to Azazel must wash his clothes and take a bath before he comes back into camp. 
03Lv 16:27 The bull and the goat used for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to take away sin, shall be carried outside the camp and burned. Skin, meat, and intestines shall all be burned. 
03Lv 16:28 The one who burns them must wash his clothes and take a bath before he returns to camp. 
03Lv 16:29 The following regulations are to be observed for all time to come. On the tenth day of the seventh month the Israelites and the foreigners living among them must fast and must not do any work. 
03Lv 16:30 On that day the ritual is to be performed to purify them from all their sins, so that they will be ritually clean. 
03Lv 16:31 That day is to be a very holy day, one on which they fast and do no work at all. These regulations are to be observed for all time to come. 
03Lv 16:32 The High Priest, properly ordained and consecrated to succeed his father, is to perform the ritual of purification. He shall put on the priestly garments 
03Lv 16:33 and perform the ritual to purify the Most Holy Place, the rest of the Tent of the LORD's presence, the altar, the priests, and all the people of the community. 
03Lv 16:34 These regulations are to be observed for all time to come. This ritual must be performed once a year to purify the people of Israel from all their sins. So Moses did as the LORD had commanded. 
03Lv 17:1 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 17:2 to give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations. 
03Lv 17:3 Any Israelites who kill a cow or a sheep or a goat as an offering to the LORD anywhere except at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence have broken the Law.
03Lv 17:4 They have shed blood and shall no longer be considered God's people. 
03Lv 17:5 The meaning of this command is that the people of Israel shall now bring to the LORD the animals which they used to kill in the open country. They shall now bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent and kill them as fellowship offerings. 
03Lv 17:6 The priest shall throw the blood against the sides of the altar at the entrance of the Tent and burn the fat to produce an odor that is pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 17:7 The people of Israel must no longer be unfaithful to the LORD by killing their animals in the fields as sacrifices to the goat demons. The people of Israel must keep this regulation for all time to come. 
03Lv 17:8 Any Israelites or any foreigners living in the community who offer a burnt offering or any other sacrifice 
03Lv 17:9 as an offering to the LORD anywhere except at the entrance of the Tent shall no longer be considered God's people. 
03Lv 17:10 If any Israelites or any foreigners living in the community eat meat with blood still in it, the LORD will turn against them and no longer consider them his people. 
03Lv 17:11 The life of every living thing is in the blood, and that is why the LORD has commanded that all blood be poured out on the altar to take away the people's sins. Blood, which is life, takes away sins. 
03Lv 17:12 That is why the LORD has told the people of Israel that neither they nor any foreigner living among them shall eat any meat with blood still in it. 
03Lv 17:13 If any Israelites or any foreigners living in the community catch an animal or a bird which is ritually clean, they must pour its blood out on the ground and cover it with dirt. 
03Lv 17:14 The life of every living thing is in the blood, and that is why the LORD has told the people of Israel that they shall not eat any meat with blood still in it and that anyone who does so will no longer be considered one of his people. 
03Lv 17:15 Any people, Israelites or foreigners, who eat meat from an animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals must wash their clothes, take a bath, and wait until evening before they are ritually clean. 
03Lv 17:16 If they do not, they must suffer the consequences. 
03Lv 18:1 The LORD told Moses 
03Lv 18:2 to say to the people of Israel, "I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 18:3 Do not follow the practices of the people of Egypt, where you once lived, or of the people in the land of Canaan, where I am now taking you. 
03Lv 18:4 Obey my laws and do what I command. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 18:5 Follow the practices and the laws that I give you; you will save your life by doing so. I am the LORD." 
03Lv 18:6 The LORD gave the following regulations. Do not have sexual intercourse with any of your relatives. 
03Lv 18:7 Do not disgrace your father by having intercourse with your mother. You must not disgrace your own mother. 
03Lv 18:8 Do not disgrace your father by having intercourse with any of his other wives. 
03Lv 18:9 Do not have intercourse with your sister or your stepsister, whether or not she was brought up in the same house with you. 
03Lv 18:10 Do not have intercourse with your granddaughter; that would be a disgrace to you. 
03Lv 18:11 Do not have intercourse with a half sister; she, too, is your sister. 
03Lv 18:12 Do not have intercourse with an aunt,
03Lv 18:13 whether she is your father's sister or your mother's sister. 
03Lv 18:14 Do not have intercourse with your uncle's wife; she, too, is your aunt. 
03Lv 18:15 Do not have intercourse with your daughter-in-law 
03Lv 18:16 or with your brother's wife. 
03Lv 18:17 Do not have intercourse with the daughter or granddaughter of a woman with whom you have had intercourse; they may be related to you, and that would be incest. 
03Lv 18:18 Do not take your wife's sister as one of your wives, as long as your wife is living. 
03Lv 18:19 Do not have intercourse with a woman during her monthly period, because she is ritually unclean. 
03Lv 18:20 Do not have intercourse with another man's wife; that would make you ritually unclean. 
03Lv 18:21 Do not hand over any of your children to be used in the worship of the god Molech, because that would bring disgrace on the name of God, the LORD. 
03Lv 18:22 No man is to have sexual relations with another man; God hates that. 
03Lv 18:23 No man or woman is to have sexual relations with an animal; that perversion makes you ritually unclean. 
03Lv 18:24 Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these acts, for that is how the pagans made themselves unclean, those pagans who lived in the land before you and whom the LORD is driving out so that you can go in. 
03Lv 18:25 Their actions made the land unclean, and so the LORD is punishing the land and making it reject the people who lived there. 
03Lv 18:26 They did all these disgusting things and made the land unclean, but you must not do them.
03Lv 18:27 All of you, whether Israelites or foreigners living with you, must keep the LORD's laws and commands, 
03Lv 18:28 and then the land will not reject you, as it rejected the pagans who lived there before you. 
03Lv 18:29 You know that whoever does any of these disgusting things will no longer be considered one of God's people. 
03Lv 18:30 And the LORD said, "Obey the commands I give and do not follow the practices of the people who lived in the land before you, and do not make yourselves unclean by doing any of these things. I am the LORD your God." 
03Lv 19:1 The LORD told Moses 
03Lv 19:2 to say to the community of Israel, "Be holy, because I, the LORD your God, am holy. 
03Lv 19:3 Each of you must respect your mother and your father, and must keep the Sabbath, as I have commanded. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:4 "Do not abandon me and worship idols; do not make gods of metal and worship them. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:5 "When you kill an animal for a fellowship offering, keep the regulations that I have given you, and I will accept the offering. 
03Lv 19:6 The meat must be eaten on the day the animal is killed or on the next day. Any meat left on the third day must be burned, 
03Lv 19:7 because it is ritually unclean, and if anyone eats it, I will not accept the offering. 
03Lv 19:8 Any who eat it will be guilty of treating as ordinary what is dedicated to me, and they will no longer be considered my people. 
03Lv 19:9 "When you harvest your fields, do not cut the grain at the edges of the fields, and do not go back to cut the heads of grain that were left. 
03Lv 19:10 Do not go back through your vineyard to gather the grapes that were missed or to pick up the grapes that have fallen; leave them for poor people and foreigners. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:11 "Do not steal or cheat or lie. 
03Lv 19:12 Do not make a promise in my name if you do not intend to keep it; that brings disgrace on my name. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:13 "Do not rob or take advantage of anyone. Do not hold back the wages of someone you have hired, not even for one night. 
03Lv 19:14 Do not curse the deaf or put something in front of the blind so as to make them stumble over it. Obey me; I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:15 "Be honest and just when you make decisions in legal cases; do not show favoritism to the poor or fear the rich. 
03Lv 19:16 Do not spread lies about anyone, and when someone is on trial for his life, speak out if your testimony can help him. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 19:17 "Do not bear a grudge against others, but settle your differences with them, so that you will not commit a sin because of them. 
03Lv 19:18 Do not take revenge on others or continue to hate them, but love your neighbors as you love yourself. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 19:19 "Obey my commands. Do not crossbreed domestic animals. Do not plant two kinds of seed in the same field. Do not wear clothes made of two kinds of material. 
03Lv 19:20 "If a slave woman is the recognized concubine of a man and she has not been paid for and freed, then if another man has sexual relations with her, they will be punished, but not put to death, since she is a slave. 
03Lv 19:21 The man shall bring a ram to the entrance of the Tent of my presence as his repayment offering, 
03Lv 19:22 and with it the priest shall perform the ritual of purification to remove the man's sin, and God will forgive him. 
03Lv 19:23 "When you come into the land of Canaan and plant any kind of fruit tree, consider the fruit ritually unclean for the first three years. During that time you must not eat it. 
03Lv 19:24 In the fourth year all the fruit shall be dedicated as an offering to show your gratitude to me, the LORD. 
03Lv 19:25 But in the fifth year you may eat the fruit. If you do all this, your trees will bear more fruit. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:26 "Do not eat any meat with blood still in it. Do not practice any kind of magic. 
03Lv 19:27 Do not cut the hair on the sides of your head or trim your beard 
03Lv 19:28 or tattoo yourselves or cut gashes in your body to mourn for the dead. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 19:29 "Do not disgrace your daughters by making them temple prostitutes; if you do, you will turn to other gods and the land will be full of immorality. 
03Lv 19:30 Keep the Sabbath, and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 19:31 "Do not go for advice to people who consult the spirits of the dead. If you do, you will be ritually unclean. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:32 "Show respect for old people and honor them. Reverently obey me; I am the LORD. 
03Lv 19:33 "Do not mistreat foreigners who are living in your land. 
03Lv 19:34 Treat them as you would an Israelite, and love them as you love yourselves. Remember that you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 19:35 "Do not cheat anyone by using false measures of length, weight, or quantity. 
03Lv 19:36 Use honest scales, honest weights, and honest measures. I am the LORD your God, and I brought you out of Egypt. 
03Lv 19:37 Obey all my laws and commands. I am the LORD." 
03Lv 20:1 The LORD told Moses 
03Lv 20:2 to say to the people of Israel, "Any of you or any foreigner living among you who gives any children to be used in the worship of the god Molech shall be stoned to death by the whole community. 
03Lv 20:3 If any of you give one of your children to Molech and make my sacred Tent unclean and disgrace my holy name, I will turn against you and will no longer consider you my people. 
03Lv 20:4 But if the community ignores what you have done and does not put you to death, 
03Lv 20:5 I myself will turn against you and your whole family and against all who join you in being unfaithful to me and worshiping Molech. I will no longer consider any of you my people. 
03Lv 20:6 "If any of you go for advice to people who consult the spirits of the dead, I will turn against you and will no longer consider you one of my people. 
03Lv 20:7 Keep yourselves holy, because I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 20:8 Obey my laws, because I am the LORD and I make you holy." 
03Lv 20:9 The LORD gave the following regulations. Any of you that curse your father or mother shall be put to death; you are responsible for your own death. 
03Lv 20:10 If a man commits adultery with the wife of an Israelite, both he and the woman shall be put to death. 
03Lv 20:11 A man who has intercourse with one of his father's wives disgraces his father, and both he and the woman shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death. 
03Lv 20:12 If a man has intercourse with his daughter-in-law, they shall both be put to death. They have committed incest and are responsible for their own death. 
03Lv 20:13 If a man has sexual relations with another man, they have done a disgusting thing, and both shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death. 
03Lv 20:14 If a man marries a woman and her mother, all three shall be burned to death because of the disgraceful thing they have done; such a thing must not be permitted among you. 
03Lv 20:15 If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he and the animal shall be put to death. 
03Lv 20:16 If a woman tries to have sexual relations with an animal, she and the animal shall be put to death. They are responsible for their own death. 
03Lv 20:17 If a man marries his sister or half sister, they shall be publicly disgraced and driven out of the community. He has had intercourse with his sister and must suffer the consequences. 
03Lv 20:18 If a man has intercourse with a woman during her monthly period, both of them are to be driven out of the community, because they have broken the regulations about ritual uncleanness. 
03Lv 20:19 If a man has intercourse with his aunt, both of them must suffer the consequences for incest. 
03Lv 20:20 If a man has intercourse with his uncle's wife, he disgraces his uncle, and he and the woman will pay the penalty; neither one will have children. 
03Lv 20:21 If a man takes his brother's wife, they will die childless. He has done a ritually unclean thing and has disgraced his brother. 
03Lv 20:22 The LORD said, "Keep all my laws and commands, so that you will not be rejected by the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. 
03Lv 20:23 Do not adopt the customs of the people who live there; I am driving out those pagans so that you can enter the land. They have disgusted me with all their evil practices. 
03Lv 20:24 But I have promised you this rich and fertile land as your possession, and I will give it to you. I am the LORD your God, and I have set you apart from the other nations. 
03Lv 20:25 So then, you must make a clear distinction between animals and birds that are ritually clean and those that are not. Do not eat unclean animals or birds. I have declared them unclean, and eating them would make you unclean. 
03Lv 20:26 You shall be holy and belong only to me, because I am the LORD and I am holy. I have set you apart from the other nations so that you would belong to me alone. 
03Lv 20:27 "Any man or woman who consults the spirits of the dead shall be stoned to death; any of you that do this are responsible for your own death." 
03Lv 21:1 The LORD commanded Moses to tell the Aaronite priests, "No priest is to make himself ritually unclean by taking part in the funeral ceremonies when a relative dies, 
03Lv 21:2 unless it is his mother, father, son, daughter, brother, 
03Lv 21:3 or unmarried sister living in his house. 
03Lv 21:4 He shall not make himself unclean at the death of those related to him by marriage. 
03Lv 21:5 "No priest shall shave any part of his head or trim his beard or cut gashes on his body to show that he is in mourning. 
03Lv 21:6 He must be holy and must not disgrace my name. He offers food offerings to me, and he must be holy. 
03Lv 21:7 A priest shall not marry a woman who has been a prostitute or a woman who is not a virgin or who is divorced; he is holy. 
03Lv 21:8 The people must consider the priest holy, because he presents the food offerings to me. I am the LORD; I am holy and I make my people holy. 
03Lv 21:9 If a priest's daughter becomes a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she shall be burned to death. 
03Lv 21:10 "The High Priest has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been consecrated to wear the priestly garments, so he must not leave his hair uncombed or tear his clothes to show that he is in mourning. 
03Lv 21:11 He has been dedicated to me and is not to make himself ritually unclean nor is he to defile my sacred Tent by leaving it
03Lv 21:12 and entering a house where there is a dead person, even if it is his own father or mother. 
03Lv 21:13 He shall marry a virgin, 
03Lv 21:14 not a widow or a divorced woman or a woman who has been a prostitute. He shall marry only a virgin from his own clan. 
03Lv 21:15 Otherwise, his children, who ought to be holy, will be ritually unclean. I am the LORD and I have set him apart as the High Priest." 
03Lv 21:16 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 21:17 to tell Aaron, "None of your descendants who has any physical defects may present the food offering to me. This applies for all time to come. 
03Lv 21:18 No man with any physical defects may make the offering£º no one who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed; 
03Lv 21:19 no one with a crippled hand or foot; 
03Lv 21:20 no one who is a hunchback or a dwarf; no one with any eye or skin disease; and no eunuch. 
03Lv 21:21 No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any physical defects may present the food offering to me. 
03Lv 21:22 Such a man may eat the food offered to me, both the holy food offering and the very holy food offering, 
03Lv 21:23 but because he has a physical defect, he shall not come near the sacred curtain or approach the altar. He must not profane these holy things, because I am the LORD and I make them holy." 
03Lv 21:24 This, then, is what Moses said to Aaron, the sons of Aaron, and to all the people of Israel. 
03Lv 22:1 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 22:2 to tell Aaron and his sons, "You must not bring disgrace on my holy name, so treat with respect the sacred offerings that the people of Israel dedicate to me. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 22:3 If any of your descendants, while he is ritually unclean, comes near the sacred offerings which the people of Israel have dedicated to me, he can never again serve at the altar. This applies for all time to come. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 22:4 "None of the descendants of Aaron who has a dreaded skin disease or a discharge may eat any of the sacred offerings until he is ritually clean. Any priest is unclean if he touches anything which is unclean through contact with a corpse or if he has an emission of semen 
03Lv 22:5 or if he has touched an unclean animal or person. 
03Lv 22:6 Any priest who becomes unclean remains unclean until evening, and even then he may not eat any of the sacred offerings until he has taken a bath. 
03Lv 22:7 After the sun sets he is clean, and then he may eat the sacred offerings, which are his food. 
03Lv 22:8 He shall not eat the meat of any animal that has died a natural death or has been killed by wild animals; it will make him unclean. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 22:9 "All priests shall observe the regulations that I have given. Otherwise, they will become guilty and die, because they have disobeyed the sacred regulations. I am the LORD and I make them holy. 
03Lv 22:10 "Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of the sacred offerings; no one else may eat them - not even someone staying with a priest or hired by him. 
03Lv 22:11 But a priest's slaves, bought with his own money or born in his home, may eat the food the priest receives. 
03Lv 22:12 A priest's daughter who marries someone who is not a priest may not eat any of the sacred offerings. 
03Lv 22:13 But a widowed or divorced daughter who has no children and who has returned to live in her father's house as a dependent may eat the food her father receives as a priest. Only a member of a priestly family may eat any of it. 
03Lv 22:14 "If any people who are not members of a priestly family eat any of the sacred offerings without intending to, they must repay the priest its full value plus an additional 20 percent. 
03Lv 22:15 The priests shall not profane the sacred offerings 
03Lv 22:16 by letting any unauthorized people eat them; this would bring guilt and punishment on such people. I am the LORD and I make the offerings holy." 
03Lv 22:17 The LORD commanded Moses 
03Lv 22:18 to give Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel the following regulations. When any Israelite or any foreigner living in Israel presents a burnt offering, whether as fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, the animal must not have any defects. 
03Lv 22:19 To be accepted, it must be a male without any defects. 
03Lv 22:20 If you offer any animal that has any defects, the LORD will not accept it. 
03Lv 22:21 When anyone presents a fellowship offering to the LORD, whether as fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, the animal must be without any defects if it is to be accepted. 
03Lv 22:22 Do not offer to the LORD any animal that is blind or crippled or mutilated, or that has a running sore or a skin eruption or scabs. Do not offer any such animals on the altar as a food offering. 
03Lv 22:23 As a freewill offering you may offer an animal that is stunted or not perfectly formed, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow. 
03Lv 22:24 Do not offer to the LORD any animal whose testicles have been crushed, cut, bruised, or torn off. This is not permitted in your land. 
03Lv 22:25 Do not offer as a food offering any animal obtained from a foreigner. Such animals are considered defective and are not acceptable. 
03Lv 22:26 When a calf or a lamb or a kid is born, it must not be taken from its mother for seven days,
03Lv 22:27 but after that it is acceptable as a food offering. 
03Lv 22:28 Do not sacrifice a cow and its calf or a sheep and its lamb or a goat and its kid on the same day. 
03Lv 22:29 When you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, follow the rules so that you will be accepted; 
03Lv 22:30 eat it the same day and leave none of it until the next morning. 
03Lv 22:31 The LORD said, "Obey my commands; I am the LORD. 
03Lv 22:32 Do not bring disgrace on my holy name; all the people of Israel must acknowledge me to be holy. I am the LORD and I make you holy; 
03Lv 22:33 and I brought you out of Egypt to become your God. I am the LORD." 
03Lv 23:1 The LORD gave Moses 
03Lv 23:2 the following regulations for the religious festivals, when the people of Israel are to gather for worship. 
03Lv 23:3 You have six days in which to do your work, but remember that the seventh day, the Sabbath, is a day of rest. On that day do not work, but gather for worship. The Sabbath belongs to the LORD, no matter where you live. 
03Lv 23:4 Proclaim the following festivals at the appointed times. 
03Lv 23:5 The Passover, celebrated to honor the LORD, begins at sunset on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
03Lv 23:6 On the fifteenth day the Festival of Unleavened Bread begins, and for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast. 
03Lv 23:7 On the first of these days you shall gather for worship and do none of your daily work. 
03Lv 23:8 Offer your food offerings to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day you shall again gather for worship, but you shall do none of your daily work. 
03Lv 23:9 When you come into the land that the LORD is giving you and you harvest your grain,
03Lv 23:10 take the first sheaf to the priest. 
03Lv 23:11 He shall present it as a special offering to the LORD, so that you may be accepted. The priest shall present it the day after the Sabbath. 
03Lv 23:12 On the day you present the offering of grain, also sacrifice as a burnt offering a one-year-old male lamb that has no defects. 
03Lv 23:13 With it you shall present four pounds of flour mixed with olive oil as a food offering. The odor of this offering is pleasing to the LORD. You shall also present with it an offering of one quart of wine. 
03Lv 23:14 Do not eat any of the new grain, whether raw, roasted, or baked into bread, until you have brought this offering to God. This regulation is to be observed by all your descendants for all time to come. 
03Lv 23:15 Count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath on which you bring your sheaf of grain to present to the LORD. 
03Lv 23:16 On the fiftieth day, the day after the seventh Sabbath, present to the LORD another new offering of grain. 
03Lv 23:17 Each family is to bring two loaves of bread and present them to the LORD as a special gift. Each loaf shall be made of four pounds of flour baked with yeast and shall be presented to the LORD as an offering of the first grain to be harvested. 
03Lv 23:18 And with the bread the community is to present seven one-year-old lambs, one bull, and two rams, none of which may have any defects. They shall be offered as a burnt offering to the LORD, along with a grain offering and a wine offering. The odor of this offering is pleasing to the LORD. 
03Lv 23:19 Also offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering. 
03Lv 23:20 The priest shall present the bread with the two lambs as a special gift to the LORD for the priests. These offerings are holy. 
03Lv 23:21 On that day do none of your daily work, but gather for worship. Your descendants are to observe this regulation for all time to come, no matter where they live. 
03Lv 23:22 When you harvest your fields, do not cut the grain at the edges of the fields, and do not go back to cut the heads of grain that were left; leave them for poor people and foreigners. The LORD is your God. 
03Lv 23:23 On the first day of the seventh month observe a special day of rest,
03Lv 23:24 and come together for worship when the trumpets sound. 
03Lv 23:25 Present a food offering to the LORD and do none of your daily work. 
03Lv 23:26 The tenth day of the seventh month is the day when the annual ritual is to be performed to take away the sins of the people.
03Lv 23:27 On that day do not eat anything at all; come together for worship, and present a food offering to the LORD. 
03Lv 23:28 Do no work on that day, because it is the day for performing the ritual to take away sin. 
03Lv 23:29 Any who eat anything on that day will no longer be considered God's people. 
03Lv 23:30 And if any do any work on that day, the LORD himself will put them to death. 
03Lv 23:31 This regulation applies to all your descendants, no matter where they live. 
03Lv 23:32 From sunset on the ninth day of the month to sunset on the tenth observe this day as a special day of rest, during which nothing may be eaten. 
03Lv 23:33 The Festival of Shelters begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month
03Lv 23:34 and continues for seven days. 
03Lv 23:35 On the first of these days come together for worship and do none of your daily work. 
03Lv 23:36 Each day for seven days you shall present a food offering. On the eighth day come together again for worship and present a food offering. It is a day for worship, and you shall do no work. 
03Lv 23:37 (These are the religious festivals on which you honor the LORD by gathering together for worship and presenting food offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices, and wine offerings, as required day by day. 
03Lv 23:38 These festivals are in addition to the regular Sabbaths, and these offerings are in addition to your regular gifts, your offerings as fulfillment of vows, and your freewill offerings that you give to the LORD.) 
03Lv 23:39 When you have harvested your fields, celebrate this festival for seven days, beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The first day shall be a special day of rest. 
03Lv 23:40 On that day take some of the best fruit from your trees, take palm branches and limbs from leafy trees, and begin a religious festival to honor the LORD your God. 
03Lv 23:41 Celebrate it for seven days. This regulation is to be kept by your descendants for all time to come. 
03Lv 23:42 All the people of Israel shall live in shelters for seven days, 
03Lv 23:43 so that your descendants may know that the LORD made the people of Israel live in simple shelters when he led them out of Egypt. He is the LORD your God. 
03Lv 23:44 So in this way Moses gave the people of Israel the regulations for observing the religious festivals to honor the LORD. 
03Lv 24:1 The LORD told Moses 
03Lv 24:2 to give the following orders to the people of Israel£º Bring pure olive oil of the finest quality for the lamps in the Tent, so that a light might be kept burning regularly. 
03Lv 24:3 Each evening Aaron shall light them and keep them burning until morning, there in the LORD's presence outside the curtain in front of the Covenant Box, which is in the Most Holy Place. This regulation is to be observed for all time to come. 
03Lv 24:4 Aaron shall take care of the lamps on the lampstand of pure gold and must see that they burn regularly in the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 24:5 Take twenty-four pounds of flour and bake twelve loaves of bread. 
03Lv 24:6 Put the loaves in two rows, six in each row, on the table covered with pure gold, which is in the LORD's presence. 
03Lv 24:7 Put some pure incense on each row, as a token food offering to the LORD to take the place of the bread. 
03Lv 24:8 Every Sabbath, for all time to come, the bread must be placed in the presence of the LORD. This is Israel's duty forever. 
03Lv 24:9 The bread belongs to Aaron and his descendants, and they shall eat it in a holy place, because this is a very holy part of the food offered to the LORD for the priests. 
03Lv 24:10 There was a man whose father was an Egyptian and whose mother was an Israelite named Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan. 
03Lv 24:11 There in the camp this man quarreled with an Israelite. During the quarrel he cursed the LORD, so they took him to Moses, 
03Lv 24:12 put him under guard, and waited for the LORD to tell them what to do with him. 
03Lv 24:13 The LORD said to Moses, 
03Lv 24:14 "Take that man out of the camp. Everyone who heard him curse shall put his hands on the man's head to testify that he is guilty, and then the whole community shall stone him to death. 
03Lv 24:15 Then tell the people of Israel that anyone who curses God must suffer the consequences 
03Lv 24:16 and be put to death. Any Israelite or any foreigner living in Israel who curses the LORD shall be stoned to death by the whole community. 
03Lv 24:17 "Any who commit murder shall be put to death, 
03Lv 24:18 and any who kill an animal belonging to someone else must replace it. The principle is a life for a life. 
03Lv 24:19 "If any of you injure another person, whatever you have done shall be done to you. 
03Lv 24:20 If you break a bone, one of your bones shall be broken; if you put out an eye, one of your eyes shall be put out; if you knock out a tooth, one of your teeth shall be knocked out. Whatever injury you cause another person shall be done to you in return. 
03Lv 24:21 Whoever kills an animal shall replace it, but whoever kills a human being shall be put to death. 
03Lv 24:22 This law applies to all of you, to Israelites and to foreigners living among you, because I am the LORD your God." 
03Lv 24:23 When Moses had said this to the people of Israel, they took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death. In this way the people of Israel did what the LORD had commanded Moses. 
03Lv 25:1 The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and commanded him 
03Lv 25:2 to give the following regulations to the people of Israel. When you enter the land that the LORD is giving you, you shall honor the LORD by not cultivating the land every seventh year. 
03Lv 25:3 You shall plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and gather your crops for six years. 
03Lv 25:4 But the seventh year is to be a year of complete rest for the land, a year dedicated to the LORD. Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards. 
03Lv 25:5 Do not even harvest the grain that grows by itself without being planted, and do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines; it is a year of complete rest for the land. 
03Lv 25:6 Although the land has not been cultivated during that year, it will provide food for you, your slaves, your hired men, the foreigners living with you, 
03Lv 25:7 your domestic animals, and the wild animals in your fields. Everything that it produces may be eaten. 
03Lv 25:8 Count seven times seven years, a total of forty-nine years. 
03Lv 25:9 Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement, send someone to blow a trumpet throughout the whole land. 
03Lv 25:10 In this way you shall set the fiftieth year apart and proclaim freedom to all the inhabitants of the land. During this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to the original owner or the descendants, and any who have been sold as slaves shall return to their families. 
03Lv 25:11 You shall not plant your fields or harvest the grain that grows by itself or gather the grapes in your unpruned vineyards. 
03Lv 25:12 The whole year shall be sacred for you; you shall eat only what the fields produce of themselves. 
03Lv 25:13 In this year all property that has been sold shall be restored to its original owner. 
03Lv 25:14 So when you sell land to an Israelite or buy land, do not deal unfairly. 
03Lv 25:15 The price is to be set according to the number of years the land can produce crops before the next Year of Restoration. 
03Lv 25:16 If there are many years, the price shall be higher, but if there are only a few years, the price shall be lower, because what is being sold is the number of crops the land can produce. 
03Lv 25:17 Do not cheat an Israelite, but obey the LORD your God. 
03Lv 25:18 Obey all the LORD's laws and commands, so that you may live in safety in the land. 
03Lv 25:19 The land will produce its crops, and you will have all you want to eat and will live in safety. 
03Lv 25:20 But someone may ask what there will be to eat during the seventh year, when no fields are planted and no crops gathered. 
03Lv 25:21 The LORD will bless the land in the sixth year so that it will produce enough food for two years. 
03Lv 25:22 When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating what you harvested during the sixth year, and you will have enough to eat until the crops you plant that year are harvested. 
03Lv 25:23 Your land must not be sold on a permanent basis, because you do not own it; it belongs to God, and you are like foreigners who are allowed to make use of it. 
03Lv 25:24 When land is sold, the right of the original owner to buy it back must be recognized. 
03Lv 25:25 If any of you Israelites become poor and are forced to sell your land, your closest relative is to buy it back. 
03Lv 25:26 If you have no relative to buy it back, you may later become prosperous and have enough to buy it back yourself. 
03Lv 25:27 In that case you must pay to the one who bought it a sum that will make up for the years remaining until the next Year of Restoration, when you would in any event recover your land. 
03Lv 25:28 But if you do not have enough money to buy the land back, it remains under the control of the one who bought it until the next Year of Restoration. In that year it will be returned to its original owner. 
03Lv 25:29 If you sell a house in a walled city, you have the right to buy it back during the first full year from the date of sale. 
03Lv 25:30 But if you do not buy it back within the year, you lose the right of repurchase, and the house becomes the permanent property of the purchasers and their descendants; it will not be returned in the Year of Restoration. 
03Lv 25:31 But houses in unwalled villages are to be treated like fields; the original owner has the right to buy them back, and they are to be returned in the Year of Restoration. 
03Lv 25:32 However, Levites have the right to buy back at any time their property in the cities assigned to them. 
03Lv 25:33 If a house in one of these cities is sold by a Levite and is not bought back, it must be returned in the Year of Restoration, because the houses which the Levites own in their cities are their permanent property among the people of Israel. 
03Lv 25:34 But the pasture land around the Levite cities shall never be sold; it is their property forever. 
03Lv 25:35 If any Israelites living near you become poor and cannot support themselves, you must provide for them as you would for a hired worker, so that they can continue to live near you. 
03Lv 25:36 Do not charge Israelites any interest, but obey God and let them live near you. 
03Lv 25:37 Do not make them pay interest on the money you lend them, and do not make a profit on the food you sell them. 
03Lv 25:38 This is the command of the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt in order to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. 
03Lv 25:39 If any Israelites living near you become so poor that they sell themselves to you as a slave, you shall not make them do the work of a slave. 
03Lv 25:40 They shall stay with you as hired workers and serve you until the next Year of Restoration. 
03Lv 25:41 At that time they and their children shall leave you and return to their family and to the property of their ancestors. 
03Lv 25:42 The people of Israel are the LORD's slaves, and he brought them out of Egypt; they must not be sold into slavery. 
03Lv 25:43 Do not treat them harshly, but obey your God. 
03Lv 25:44 If you need slaves, you may buy them from the nations around you. 
03Lv 25:45 You may also buy the children of the foreigners who are living among you. Such children born in your land may become your property, 
03Lv 25:46 and you may leave them as an inheritance to your children, whom they must serve as long as they live. But you must not treat any Israelites harshly. 
03Lv 25:47 Suppose a foreigner living with you becomes rich, while some Israelites become poor and sell themselves as slaves to that foreigner or to a member of that foreigner's family. 
03Lv 25:48 After they are sold, they still have the right to be bought back. A brother 
03Lv 25:49 or an uncle or a cousin or another close relative may buy them back; or if they themselves earn enough, they may buy their own freedom. 
03Lv 25:50 They must consult the one who bought them, and they must count the years from the time they sold themselves until the next Year of Restoration and must set the price for their release on the basis of the wages paid hired workers. 
03Lv 25:51 They must refund a part of the purchase price
03Lv 25:52 according to the number of years left, 
03Lv 25:53 as if they had been hired on an annual basis. Their master must not treat them harshly. 
03Lv 25:54 If they are not set free in any of these ways, they and their children must be set free in the next Year of Restoration. 
03Lv 25:55 Israelites cannot be permanent slaves, because the people of Israel are the LORD's slaves. He brought them out of Egypt; he is the LORD their God. 
03Lv 26:1 The LORD said, "Do not make idols or set up statues, stone pillars, or carved stones to worship. I am the LORD your God. 
03Lv 26:2 Keep the religious festivals and honor the place where I am worshiped. I am the LORD. 
03Lv 26:3 "If you live according to my laws and obey my commands, 
03Lv 26:4 I will send you rain at the right time, so that the land will produce crops and the trees will bear fruit. 
03Lv 26:5 Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting grain when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it is time to plant grain. You will have all that you want to eat, and you can live in safety in your land. 
03Lv 26:6 "I will give you peace in your land, and you can sleep without being afraid of anyone. I will get rid of the dangerous animals in the land, and there will be no more war there. 
03Lv 26:7 You will be victorious over your enemies; 
03Lv 26:8 five of you will be able to defeat a hundred, and a hundred will be able to defeat ten thousand. 
03Lv 26:9 I will bless you and give you many children; I will keep my part of the covenant that I made with you. 
03Lv 26:10 Your harvests will be so plentiful that they will last for a year, and even then you will have to throw away what is left of the old harvest to make room for the new. 
03Lv 26:11 I will live among you in my sacred Tent, and I will never turn away from you. 
03Lv 26:12 I will be with you; I will be your God, and you will be my people. 
03Lv 26:13 I, the LORD your God, brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves. I broke the power that held you down and I let you walk with your head held high." 
03Lv 26:14 The LORD said, "If you will not obey my commands, you will be punished. 
03Lv 26:15 If you refuse to obey my laws and commands and break the covenant I have made with you, 
03Lv 26:16 I will punish you. I will bring disaster on you - incurable diseases and fevers that will make you blind and cause your life to waste away. You will plant your crops, but it will do you no good, because your enemies will conquer you and eat what you have grown. 
03Lv 26:17 I will turn against you, so that you will be defeated, and those who hate you will rule over you; you will be so terrified that you will run when no one is chasing you. 
03Lv 26:18 "If even after all of this you still do not obey me, I will increase your punishment seven times. 
03Lv 26:19 I will break your stubborn pride; there will be no rain, and your land will be dry and as hard as iron. 
03Lv 26:20 All your hard work will do you no good, because your land will not produce crops and the trees will not bear fruit. 
03Lv 26:21 "If you still continue to resist me and refuse to obey me, I will again increase your punishment seven times. 
03Lv 26:22 I will send dangerous animals among you, and they will kill your children, destroy your livestock, and leave so few of you that your roads will be deserted. 
03Lv 26:23 "If after all of this punishment you still do not listen to me, but continue to defy me, 
03Lv 26:24 then I will turn on you and punish you seven times harder than before. 
03Lv 26:25 I will bring war on you to punish you for breaking our covenant, and if you gather in your cities for safety, I will send incurable diseases among you, and you will be forced to surrender to your enemies. 
03Lv 26:26 I will cut off your food supply, so that ten women will need only one oven to bake all the bread they have. They will ration it out, and when you have eaten it all, you will still be hungry. 
03Lv 26:27 "If after all of this you still continue to defy me and refuse to obey me, 
03Lv 26:28 then in my anger I will turn on you and again make your punishment seven times worse than before. 
03Lv 26:29 Your hunger will be so great that you will eat your own children. 
03Lv 26:30 I will destroy your places of worship on the hills, tear down your incense altars, and throw your dead bodies on your fallen idols. In utter disgust 
03Lv 26:31 I will turn your cities into ruins, destroy your places of worship, and refuse to accept your sacrifices. 
03Lv 26:32 I will destroy your land so completely that the enemies who occupy it will be shocked at the destruction. 
03Lv 26:33 I will bring war on you and scatter you in foreign lands. Your land will be deserted, and your cities left in ruins. 
03Lv 26:34 Then the land will enjoy the years of complete rest that you would not give it; 
03Lv 26:35 it will lie abandoned and get its rest while you are in exile in the land of your enemies. 
03Lv 26:36 "I will make those of you who are in exile so terrified that the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will make you run. You will run as if you were being pursued in battle, and you will fall when there is no enemy near you. 
03Lv 26:37 You will stumble over one another when no one is chasing you, and you will be unable to fight against any enemy. 
03Lv 26:38 You will die in exile, swallowed up by the land of your enemies. 
03Lv 26:39 The few of you who survive in the land of your enemies will waste away because of your own sin and the sin of your ancestors. 
03Lv 26:40 "But your descendants will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors, who resisted me and rebelled against me, 
03Lv 26:41 and caused me to turn against them and send them into exile in the land of their enemies. At last, when your descendants are humbled and they have paid the penalty for their sin and rebellion, 
03Lv 26:42 I will remember my covenant with Jacob and with Isaac and with Abraham, and I will renew my promise to give my people the land. 
03Lv 26:43 First, however, the land must be rid of its people, so that it can enjoy its complete rest, and they must pay the full penalty for having rejected my laws and my commands. 
03Lv 26:44 But even then, when they are still in the land of their enemies, I will not completely abandon them or destroy them. That would put an end to my covenant with them, and I am the LORD their God. 
03Lv 26:45 I will renew the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I showed all the nations my power by bringing my people out of Egypt, in order that I, the LORD, might be their God." 
03Lv 26:46 All these are the laws and commands that the LORD gave to Moses on Mount Sinai for the people of Israel. 
03Lv 27:1 The LORD gave Moses 
03Lv 27:2 the following regulations for the people of Israel. When any of you have been given to the LORD in fulfillment of a special vow, you may be set free by the payment of the following sums of money, 
03Lv 27:3 according to the official standard£º - adult male, twenty to sixty years old£º 50 pieces of silver - 
03Lv 27:4 adult female£º 30 pieces of silver - 
03Lv 27:5 young male, five to twenty years old£º 20 pieces of silver - 
03Lv 27:6 young female£º 10 pieces of silver - infant male under five£º 5 pieces of silver - infant female£º 3 pieces of silver - 
03Lv 27:7 male above sixty years of age£º 15 pieces of silver - female above sixty£º 10 pieces of silver 
03Lv 27:8 If any of you make a vow and are too poor to pay the standard price, you shall bring the person to the priest, and the priest will set a lower price, according to your ability to pay. 
03Lv 27:9 If your vow concerns an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, then every gift made to the LORD is sacred, 
03Lv 27:10 and you may not substitute another animal for it. If you do, both animals belong to the LORD. 
03Lv 27:11 But if your vow concerns a ritually unclean animal, which is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD, you shall take the animal to the priest. 
03Lv 27:12 The priest shall set a price for it, according to its good or bad qualities, and the price will be final. 
03Lv 27:13 If you wish to buy it back, you must pay the price plus an additional 20 percent. 
03Lv 27:14 When any of you dedicate your house to the LORD, the priest shall set the price according to its good or bad points, and the price will be final. 
03Lv 27:15 If you wish to buy your house back, you must pay the price plus an additional 20 percent. 
03Lv 27:16 If any of you dedicate part of your land to the LORD, the price shall be set according to the amount of seed it takes to sow it, at the rate of ten pieces of silver per bushel of barley. 
03Lv 27:17 If you dedicate the land immediately after a Year of Restoration, the full price applies. 
03Lv 27:18 If you dedicate it any time later, the priest shall estimate the cash value according to the number of years left until the next Year of Restoration, and set a reduced price. 
03Lv 27:19 If you wish to buy your field back, you must pay the price plus an additional 20 percent. 
03Lv 27:20 If you sell the field to someone else without first buying it back from the LORD, you lose the right to buy it back. 
03Lv 27:21 At the next Year of Restoration the field will become the LORD's permanent property; it shall belong to the priests. 
03Lv 27:22 If you dedicate to the LORD a field that you have bought, 
03Lv 27:23 the priest shall estimate its value according to the number of years until the next Year of Restoration, and you must pay the price that very day; the money belongs to the LORD. 
03Lv 27:24 At the Year of Restoration the field shall be returned to the original owner or to the descendants. 
03Lv 27:25 All prices shall be set according to the official standard. 
03Lv 27:26 The first-born of an animal already belongs to the LORD, so no one may dedicate it to him as a freewill offering. A calf, a lamb, or a kid belongs to the LORD, 
03Lv 27:27 but the first-born of an unclean animal may be bought back at the standard price plus an additional 20 percent. If it is not bought back, it may be sold to someone else at the standard price. 
03Lv 27:28 None of you may sell or buy back what you have unconditionally dedicated to the LORD, whether it is a human being, an animal, or land. It belongs permanently to the LORD. 
03Lv 27:29 Not even human beings who have been unconditionally dedicated may be bought back; they must be put to death. 
03Lv 27:30 One tenth of all the produce of the land, whether grain or fruit, belongs to the LORD. 
03Lv 27:31 If you wish to buy any of it back, you must pay the standard price plus an additional 20 percent. 
03Lv 27:32 One of every ten domestic animals belongs to the LORD. When the animals are counted, every tenth one belongs to the LORD. 
03Lv 27:33 You may not arrange the animals so that the poor animals are chosen, and you may not make any substitutions. If you do substitute one animal for another, then both animals will belong to the LORD and may not be bought back. 
03Lv 27:34 These are the commands that the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the people of Israel.

04Nm 1:1 On the first day of the second month in the second year after the people of Israel left Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses there in the Tent of his presence in the Sinai Desert. He said, 
04Nm 1:2 "You and Aaron are to take a census of the people of Israel by clans and families. List the names of all the men 
04Nm 1:3 twenty years old or older who are fit for military service. 
04Nm 1:4 Ask one clan chief from each tribe to help you." 
04Nm 1:5 These are the men, leaders within their tribes, who were chosen from the community for this work£º[Tribe£º Clan chief] Reuben£º Elizur son of Shedeur,
04Nm 1:6 Simeon£º Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
04Nm 1:7 Judah£º Nahshon son of Amminadab,
04Nm 1:8 Issachar£º Nethanel son of Zuar,
04Nm 1:9 Zebulun£º Eliab son of Helon,
04Nm 1:10 Ephraim£º Elishama son of Ammihud, Manasseh£º Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
04Nm 1:11 Benjamin£º Abidan son of Gideoni,
04Nm 1:12 Dan£º Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai,
04Nm 1:13 Asher£º Pagiel son of Ochran,
04Nm 1:14 Gad£º Eliasaph son of Deuel,
04Nm 1:15 Naphtali£º Ahira son of Enan.
04Nm 1:16 These are the men, leaders within their tribes, who were chosen from the community for this work.
04Nm 1:17 With the help of these twelve men Moses and Aaron 
04Nm 1:18 called together the whole community on the first day of the second month and registered all the people by clans and families. The names of all the men twenty years old or older were recorded and counted, 
04Nm 1:19 as the LORD had commanded. In the Sinai Desert, Moses registered the people. 
04Nm 1:20 The men twenty years old or older who were fit for military service were registered by name according to clan and family, beginning with the tribe of Reuben, Jacob's oldest son. The totals were as follows£º[Tribe Number]
04Nm 1:21 Reuben 46,500,
04Nm 1:22 Simeon
04Nm 1:23 59,300,
04Nm 1:24 Gad
04Nm 1:25 45,650,
04Nm 1:26 Judah

04Nm 1:44 (SEE v.20)
04Nm 1:45 (SEE v.20)
04Nm 1:46 Total 603,550.
04Nm 1:47 The Levites were not registered with the other tribes, 
04Nm 1:48 because the LORD had said to Moses, 
04Nm 1:49 "When you take a census of the men fit for military service, do not include the tribe of Levi. 
04Nm 1:50 Instead, put the Levites in charge of the Tent of my presence and all its equipment. They shall carry it and its equipment, serve in it, and set up their camp around it. 
04Nm 1:51 Whenever you move your camp, the Levites shall take the Tent down and set it up again at each new campsite. Anyone else who comes near the Tent shall be put to death. 
04Nm 1:52 The rest of the Israelites shall set up camp, company by company, each man with his own group and under his own banner. 
04Nm 1:53 But the Levites shall camp around the Tent to guard it, so that no one may come near and cause my anger to strike the community of Israel." 
04Nm 1:54 So the people of Israel did everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 2:1 The LORD gave Moses and Aaron the following instructions. 
04Nm 2:2 When the Israelites set up camp, each man will camp under the banner of his division and the flag of his own clan. The camp is to be set up all around the Tent. 
04Nm 2:3 On the east side, those under the banner of the division of Judah shall camp in their groups, under their leaders, as follows£º [Tribe£º Leader£º Number] Judah£º Nahshon son of Amminadab£º
04Nm 2:4 74,600,
04Nm 2:5 Issachar£º Nethanel son of Zuar£º

04Nm 2:7 Zebulun£º Eliab son of Helon£º
04Nm 2:8 57,400,
04Nm 2:9 Total: 186,400. The division of Judah shall march first. 
04Nm 2:10 On the south, those under the banner of the division of Reuben shall camp in their groups, under their leaders, as follows£º[Tribe£º Leader£º Number] Reuben£º Elizur son of Shedeur£º
04Nm 2:11 46,500,
04Nm 2:12 Simeon£º Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai£º
04Nm 2:13 59,300,
04Nm 2:14 Gad£º Eliasaph son of Deuel£º
04Nm 2:15 45,650,
04Nm 2:16 Total£º 151,450. The division of Reuben shall march second. 
04Nm 2:17 Then, between the first two divisions and the last two the Levites are to march carrying the Tent. Each division shall march in the same order as they camp, each in position under its banner. 
04Nm 2:18 On the west, those under the banner of the division of Ephraim shall camp in their groups, under their leaders, as follows£º[Tribe£º Leader£º Number] Ephraim£º Elishama son of Ammihud£º
04Nm 2:19 40,500, 
04Nm 2:20 Manasseh£º Gamaliel son of Pedahzur£º
04Nm 2:21 32,200,
04Nm 2:22 Benjamin£º Abidan son of Gideoni£º
04Nm 2:23 35,400,
04Nm 2:24 Total£º 108,100. The division of Ephraim shall march third.
04Nm 2:25 On the north, those under the banner of the division of Dan shall camp in their groups, under their leaders, as follows£º[Tribe£º Leader£º Number] Dan£º Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai£º
04Nm 2:26 62,700,
04Nm 2:27 Asher£º Pagiel son of Ochran£º

04Nm 2:29 Naphtali£º Ahira son of En£º
04Nm 2:30 53,400, 
04Nm 2:31 Total£º 157,600. The division of Dan shall march last. 
04Nm 2:32 The total number of the people of Israel enrolled in the divisions, group by group, was 603,550. 
04Nm 2:33 As the LORD had commanded Moses, the Levites were not registered with the rest of the Israelites. 
04Nm 2:34 So the people of Israel did everything the LORD had commanded Moses. They camped, each under his own banner, and they marched, each with his own clan. 
04Nm 3:1 This is the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. 
04Nm 3:2 Aaron had four sons£º Nadab, the oldest, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
04Nm 3:3 They were anointed and ordained as priests, 
04Nm 3:4 but Nadab and Abihu were killed when they offered unholy fire to the LORD in the Sinai Desert. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during Aaron's lifetime. 
04Nm 3:5 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 3:6 "Bring forward the tribe of Levi and appoint them as servants of Aaron the priest. 
04Nm 3:7 They shall do the work required for the Tent of my presence and perform duties for the priests and for the whole community. 
04Nm 3:8 They shall take charge of all the equipment of the Tent and perform the duties for the rest of the Israelites. 
04Nm 3:9 The only responsibility the Levites have is to serve Aaron and his sons. 
04Nm 3:10 You shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; anyone else who tries to do so shall be put to death." 
04Nm 3:11 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 3:12 "The Levites are now to be mine. When I killed all the first-born of the Egyptians, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal.
04Nm 3:13 Now, instead of having the first-born sons of Israel as my own, I have the Levites; they will belong to me. I am the LORD." 
04Nm 3:14 In the Sinai Desert the LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 3:15 to register the Levites by clans and families, enrolling every male a month old or older, 
04Nm 3:16 and Moses did so. 
04Nm 3:17 Levi had three sons£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, who were the ancestors of the clans that bear their names. 
04Nm 3:18 Gershon had two sons£º Libni and Shimei; 
04Nm 3:19 Kohath had four sons£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel;
04Nm 3:20 and Merari had two sons£º Mahli and Mushi. They were the ancestors of the families that bear their names.
04Nm 3:21 The clan of Gershon was composed of the families of Libni and Shimei. 
04Nm 3:22 The total number of males one month old or older that were enrolled was 7,500. 
04Nm 3:23 This clan was to camp on the west behind the Tent, 
04Nm 3:24 with Eliasaph son of Lael as chief of the clan.

04Nm 3:26 the curtains for the court which is around the Tent and the altar, and the curtain for the entrance of the court. They were responsible for all the service connected with these items. 
04Nm 3:27 The clan of Kohath was composed of the families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
04Nm 3:28 The total number of males one month old or older that were enrolled was 8,600. 
04Nm 3:29 This clan was to camp on the south side of the Tent,

04Nm 3:32 The chief of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest. He was in charge of those who carried out the duties in the Holy Place.

04Nm 3:37 They were also responsible for the posts, bases, pegs, and ropes for the outer court. 
04Nm 3:38 Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp in front of the Tent on the east. They were responsible for carrying out the services performed in the Holy Place for the people of Israel. Anyone else who tried to do so was to be put to death. 
04Nm 3:39 The total number of all the Levite males one month old or older that Moses enrolled by clans at the command of the LORD, was 22,000. 
04Nm 3:40 The LORD said to Moses, "All of Israel's first-born sons belong to me. So register by name every first-born male Israelite, one month old or older.
04Nm 3:41 But in place of them I claim all the Levites as mine! I am the LORD! I also claim the livestock of the Levites in place of all the first-born of the livestock." 
04Nm 3:42 Moses obeyed, and registered all the first-born males 
04Nm 3:43 one month old or older; the total was 22,273. 
04Nm 3:44 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 3:45 "Now dedicate the Levites as mine in place of all the first-born Israelite sons, and dedicate the livestock of the Levites in place of the first-born of the Israelites' livestock. 
04Nm 3:46 Since the first-born Israelite sons outnumber the Levites by 273, you must buy back the extra sons. 
04Nm 3:47 For each one pay five pieces of silver, according to the official standard, 
04Nm 3:48 and give this money to Aaron and his sons." 
04Nm 3:49 Moses obeyed and took 
04Nm 3:50 the 1,365 pieces of silver 
04Nm 3:51 and gave them to Aaron and his sons. 
04Nm 4:1 The LORD told Moses 
04Nm 4:2 to take a census of the Levite clan of Kohath by subclans and families, 
04Nm 4:3 and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
04Nm 4:4 Their service involves the most holy things. 
04Nm 4:5 The LORD gave Moses the following instructions. When it is time to break camp, Aaron and his sons shall enter the Tent, take down the curtain in front of the Covenant Box, and cover the Box with it. 
04Nm 4:6 They shall put a fine leather cover over it, spread a cloth of solid blue on top, and then insert the carrying poles. 
04Nm 4:7 They shall spread a blue cloth over the table for the bread offered to the LORD and put on it the dishes, the incense bowls, the offering bowls, and the jars for the wine offering. There shall always be bread on the table. 
04Nm 4:8 They shall spread a red cloth over all of this, put a fine leather cover over it, and then insert the carrying poles. 
04Nm 4:9 They shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand, with its lamps, tongs, trays, and all the olive oil containers. 
04Nm 4:10 They shall wrap it and all its equipment in a fine leather cover and place it on a carrying frame. 
04Nm 4:11 Next they shall spread a blue cloth over the gold altar, put a fine leather cover over it, and then insert the carrying poles. 
04Nm 4:12 They shall take all the utensils used in the Holy Place, wrap them in a blue cloth, put a fine leather cover over them, and place them on a carrying frame. 
04Nm 4:13 They shall remove the greasy ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it. 
04Nm 4:14 They shall put on it all the equipment used in the service at the altar£º fire pans, hooks, shovels, and basins. Then they shall put a fine leather cover over it and insert the carrying poles. 
04Nm 4:15 When it is time to break camp, the clan of Kohath shall come to carry the sacred objects only after Aaron and his sons have finished covering them and all their equipment. The Kohath clan must not touch the sacred objects, or they will die. These are the responsibilities of the Kohath clan whenever the Tent is moved. 
04Nm 4:16 Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall be responsible for the whole Tent and for the oil for the lamps, the incense, the grain offerings, the anointing oil, and everything else in the Tent that has been consecrated to the LORD. 
04Nm 4:17 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 4:18 "Do not let the clan of Kohath 
04Nm 4:19 be killed by coming near these most sacred objects. To prevent this from happening, Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each man his task and tell him what to carry. 
04Nm 4:20 But if the Kohathites enter the Tent and see the priests preparing the sacred objects for moving, they will die." 
04Nm 4:21 The LORD told Moses 
04Nm 4:22 to take a census of the Levite clan of Gershon by subclans and families, 
04Nm 4:23 and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
04Nm 4:24 They shall be responsible for carrying the following objects£º 
04Nm 4:25 the Tent, its inner cover, its outer cover, the fine leather cover on top of it, the curtain for the entrance, 
04Nm 4:26 the curtains and ropes for the court that is around the Tent and the altar, the curtains for the entrance of the court, and all the fittings used in setting up these objects. They shall perform all the tasks required for these things. 
04Nm 4:27 Moses and Aaron shall see to it that the Gershonites perform all the duties and carry everything that Aaron and his sons assign to them. 
04Nm 4:28 These are the responsibilities of the Gershon clan in the Tent; they shall carry them out under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
04Nm 4:29 The LORD told Moses to take a census of the Levite clan of Merari by subclans and families, 
04Nm 4:30 and to register all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
04Nm 4:31 They shall be responsible for carrying the frames, bars, posts, and bases of the Tent, 
04Nm 4:32 and the posts, bases, pegs, and ropes of the court around the Tent, with all the fittings used in setting them up. Each man will be responsible for carrying specific items. 
04Nm 4:33 These are the responsibilities of the Merari clan in their service in the Tent; they shall carry them out under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 
04Nm 4:34 Following the LORD's command, Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the community took a census of the three Levite clans, Kohath, Gershon, and Merari. 04Nm 4:35 They did this by subclans and families and registered all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who were qualified to work in the Tent of the LORD's presence, as follows£º [Clan£º Number] Kohath£º2,750, Gershon£º 2,630, Merari£º 3,200, Total£º 8,580.

04Nm 4:49 Each man was registered as the LORD had commanded Moses; and at the command of the LORD given through Moses, each man was assigned responsibility for his task of serving or carrying. 
04Nm 5:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 5:2 "Command the people of Israel to expel from the camp everyone with a dreaded skin disease or a bodily discharge and everyone who is unclean by contact with a corpse. 
04Nm 5:3 Send all these ritually unclean people out, so that they will not defile the camp, where I live among my people." 
04Nm 5:4 The Israelites obeyed and expelled them all from the camp. 
04Nm 5:5 The LORD gave Moses 
04Nm 5:6 the following instructions for the people of Israel. When any of you are unfaithful to the LORD and commit a wrong against someone, 
04Nm 5:7 you must confess your sin and make full repayment, plus an additional 20 percent, to the person you have wronged. 
04Nm 5:8 But if that person has died and has no near relative to whom payment can be made, it shall be given to the LORD for the priest. This payment is in addition to the ram used to perform the ritual of purification for the guilty person. 
04Nm 5:9 Also every special contribution which the Israelites offer to the LORD belongs to the priest to whom they present it. 
04Nm 5:10 Each priest shall keep the offerings presented to him. 
04Nm 5:11 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 5:12 to give the Israelites the following instructions. It may happen that a man becomes suspicious that his wife is unfaithful to him and has defiled herself by having intercourse with another man.
04Nm 5:13 But the husband may not be certain, for his wife may have kept it secret - there was no witness, and she was not caught in the act. 
04Nm 5:14 Or it may happen that a husband becomes suspicious of his wife, even though she has not been unfaithful. 
04Nm 5:15 In either case the man shall take his wife to the priest. He shall also take the required offering of two pounds of barley flour, but he shall not pour any olive oil on it or put any incense on it, because it is an offering from a suspicious husband, made to bring the truth to light. 
04Nm 5:16 The priest shall bring the woman forward and have her stand in front of the altar. 
04Nm 5:17 He shall pour some holy water into a clay bowl and take some of the earth that is on the floor of the Tent of the LORD's presence and put it in the water to make it bitter. 
04Nm 5:18 Then he shall loosen the woman's hair and put the offering of flour in her hands. In his hands the priest shall hold the bowl containing the bitter water that brings a curse. 
04Nm 5:19 Then the priest shall make the woman agree to this oath spoken by the priest£º "If you have not committed adultery, you will not be harmed by the curse that this water brings. 
04Nm 5:20 But if you have committed adultery, 
04Nm 5:21 may the LORD make your name a curse among your people. May he cause your genital organs to shrink and your stomach to swell up. 
04Nm 5:22 May this water enter your stomach and cause it to swell up and your genital organs to shrink." The woman shall respond, "I agree; may the LORD do so." 
04Nm 5:23 Then the priest shall write this curse down and wash the writing off into the bowl of bitter water. 
04Nm 5:24 Before he makes the woman drink the water, which may then cause her bitter pain, 
04Nm 5:25 the priest shall take the offering of flour out of the woman's hands, hold it out in dedication to the LORD, and present it on the altar. 
04Nm 5:26 Then he shall take a handful of it as a token offering and burn it on the altar. Finally, he shall make the woman drink the water. 
04Nm 5:27 If she has committed adultery, the water will cause bitter pain; her stomach will swell up and her genital organs will shrink. Her name will become a curse among her people. 
04Nm 5:28 But if she is innocent, she will not be harmed and will be able to bear children. 
04Nm 5:29 This is the law in cases where a man is jealous and becomes suspicious that his wife has committed adultery.
04Nm 5:30 The woman shall be made to stand in front of the altar, and the priest shall perform this ritual. 
04Nm 5:31 The husband shall be free of guilt, but the woman, if guilty, must suffer the consequences. 
04Nm 6:1 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 6:2 to give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Any of you, male or female, who make a special vow to become a nazirite and dedicate yourself to the LORD 
04Nm 6:3 shall abstain from wine and beer. You shall not drink any kind of drink made from grapes or eat any grapes or raisins. 
04Nm 6:4 As long as you are a nazirite, you shall not eat anything that comes from a grapevine, not even the seeds or skins of grapes. 
04Nm 6:5 As long as you are under the nazirite vow, you must not cut your hair or shave. You are bound by the vow for the full time that you are dedicated to the LORD, and you shall let your hair grow. 
04Nm 6:6 Your hair is the sign of your dedication to God,
04Nm 6:7 and so you must not defile yourself by going near a corpse, not even that of your father, mother, brother, or sister. 
04Nm 6:8 As long as you are a nazirite, you are consecrated to the LORD. 
04Nm 6:9 If your consecrated hair is defiled because you are right beside someone who suddenly dies, you must wait seven days and then shave your head; and so you become ritually clean. 
04Nm 6:10 On the eighth day you shall bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
04Nm 6:11 The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to perform the ritual of purification for you because of your contact with a corpse. On the same day you shall reconsecrate your hair 
04Nm 6:12 and rededicate to the LORD your time as a nazirite. The previous period of time doesn't count, because your consecrated hair was defiled. As a repayment offering you shall bring a one-year-old lamb. 
04Nm 6:13 When you complete your nazirite vow, you shall perform this ritual. You shall go to the entrance of the Tent 
04Nm 6:14 and present to the LORD three animals without any defects£º a one-year-old male lamb for a burnt offering, a one-year-old ewe lamb for a sin offering, and a ram for a fellowship offering. 
04Nm 6:15 You shall also offer a basket of bread made without yeast£º thick loaves made of flour mixed with olive oil and thin cakes brushed with olive oil, and in addition the required offerings of grain and wine. 
04Nm 6:16 The priest shall present all these to the LORD and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering. 
04Nm 6:17 He shall sacrifice the ram to the LORD as a fellowship offering, and offer it with the basket of bread; he shall also present the offerings of grain and wine. 
04Nm 6:18 At the entrance of the Tent you nazirites shall shave off your hair and put it on the fire on which the fellowship offering is being burned. 
04Nm 6:19 Then, when the shoulder of the ram is boiled, the priest shall take it and put it, together with one thick loaf of bread and one thin cake from the basket, into the hands of the nazirite. 
04Nm 6:20 Next, the priest shall present them as a special gift to the LORD; they are a sacred offering for the priest, in addition to the breast and the leg of the ram which by law belong to the priest. After that, the nazirite may drink wine. 
04Nm 6:21 These are the regulations for you nazirites; but if you promise an offering beyond what your vow requires you to give, you must fulfill exactly the promise you made. 
04Nm 6:22 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 6:23 to tell Aaron and his sons to use the following words in blessing the people of Israel£º 
04Nm 6:24 May the LORD bless you and take care of you; 
04Nm 6:25 May the LORD be kind and gracious to you; 
04Nm 6:26 May the LORD look on you with favor and give you peace. 
04Nm 6:27 And the LORD said, "If they pronounce my name as a blessing upon the people of Israel, I will bless them." 
04Nm 7:1 On the day Moses finished setting up the Tent of the LORD's presence, he anointed and dedicated the Tent and all its equipment, and the altar and all its equipment. 
04Nm 7:2 Then the clan chiefs who were leaders in the tribes of Israel, the same men who were in charge of the census, 
04Nm 7:3 brought their offerings to the LORD£º six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. After they had presented them, 
04Nm 7:4 the LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 7:5 "Accept these gifts for use in the work to be done for the Tent; give them to the Levites according to the work they have to do." 
04Nm 7:6 So Moses gave the wagons and the oxen to the Levites. 
04Nm 7:7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites, 
04Nm 7:8 and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites. All their work was to be done under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron. 
04Nm 7:9 But Moses gave no wagons or oxen to the Kohathites, because the sacred objects they took care of had to be carried on their shoulders. 
04Nm 7:10 The leaders also brought offerings to celebrate the dedication of the altar. When they were ready to present their gifts at the altar, 
04Nm 7:11 the LORD said to Moses, "Tell them that each day for a period of twelve days one of the leaders is to present his gifts for the dedication of the altar." 
04Nm 7:12 They presented their offerings in the following order£º [Day£º Tribe£º Leader] 
04Nm 7:13 1st£º Judah£º Nahshon son of Amminadab,
04Nm 7:14 2nd£º Issachar£º Nethanel son of Zuar,

04Nm 7:24 12th£º Naphtali£º Ahira son of Enan.
04Nm 7:25 The offerings each one brought were identical£º 
04Nm 7:26 one silver bowl weighing 50 ounces 
04Nm 7:27 and one silver basin weighing 30 ounces,
04Nm 7:28 by the official standard,
04Nm 7:29 both of them full of flour mixed with oil for the grain offering;
04Nm 7:30 one gold dish weighing 4 ounces,
04Nm 7:31 full of incense;
04Nm 7:32 one young bull,
04Nm 7:33 one ram,
04Nm 7:34 and a one-year-old lamb,

04Nm 7:84 The totals of the offerings brought by the twelve leaders for the dedication of the altar were as follows£º
04Nm 7:85 - twelve silver bowls and twelve silver basins weighing a total of 60 pounds
04Nm 7:86 - twelve gold dishes weighing a total of 48 ounces, filled with incense 
04Nm 7:87 - twelve bulls, twelve rams, and twelve one-year-old lambs, plus the grain offerings that go with them, for the burnt offerings
04Nm 7:88 - twelve goats for the sin offerings - twenty-four bulls, sixty rams, sixty goats, sixty one-year-old lambs, for the fellowship offerings.
04Nm 7:89 When Moses went into the Tent to talk with the LORD, he heard the LORD speaking to him from above the lid on the Covenant Box, between the two winged creatures. 
04Nm 8:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 8:2 "Tell Aaron that when he puts the seven lamps on the lampstand, he should place them so that the light shines toward the front." 
04Nm 8:3 Aaron obeyed and placed the lamps facing the front of the lampstand. 
04Nm 8:4 From top to bottom the lampstand was made of hammered gold, according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses. 
04Nm 8:5 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 8:6 "Separate the Levites from the rest of the people of Israel and purify them 
04Nm 8:7 in the following way£º sprinkle them with the water of purification and have them shave their whole bodies and have them wash their clothes. Then they will be ritually clean. 
04Nm 8:8 Then they are to take a young bull and the required grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil; and you are to take another bull for the sin offering. 
04Nm 8:9 Then assemble the whole community of Israel and have the Levites stand in front of the Tent of my presence. 
04Nm 8:10 The people of Israel are to place their hands on the heads of the Levites, 
04Nm 8:11 and then Aaron shall dedicate the Levites to me as a special gift from the Israelites, so that they may do my work. 
04Nm 8:12 The Levites shall then put their hands on the heads of the two bulls; one is to be offered as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, in order to perform the ritual of purification for the Levites. 
04Nm 8:13 "Dedicate the Levites as a special gift to me, and put Aaron and his sons in charge of them. 
04Nm 8:14 Separate the Levites in this way from the rest of the Israelites, so that they will belong to me. 
04Nm 8:15 After you have purified and dedicated the Levites, they will be qualified to work in the Tent. 
04Nm 8:16 I have claimed them in the place of all the first-born sons of the Israelites, and they belong to me alone. 
04Nm 8:17 When I killed all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated as my own the oldest son of each Israelite family and the first-born of every animal. 
04Nm 8:18 I am now taking the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites, 
04Nm 8:19 and I assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as a gift from the Israelites, to work in the Tent for the people of Israel and to protect the Israelites from the disaster that would strike them if they came too near the Holy Place." 
04Nm 8:20 So Moses, Aaron, and all the people of Israel dedicated the Levites, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
04Nm 8:21 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron dedicated them as a special gift to the LORD. He also performed the ritual of purification for them. 
04Nm 8:22 The people did everything the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites. And so the Levites were qualified to work in the Tent under Aaron and his sons. 
04Nm 8:23 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 8:24 "From the age of twenty-five each Levite shall perform his duties in the Tent of my presence, 
04Nm 8:25 and at the age of fifty he shall retire. 
04Nm 8:26 After that, he may help his fellow Levites in performing their duties in the Tent, but he must not perform any service by himself. This is how you are to regulate the duties of the Levites." 
04Nm 9:1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the Sinai Desert in the first month of the second year after the people of Israel had left Egypt. He said, 
04Nm 9:2 "On the fourteenth day of this month, beginning at sunset, 
04Nm 9:3 the people of Israel are to observe the Passover according to all the rules and regulations for it." 
04Nm 9:4 So Moses told the people to observe the Passover, 
04Nm 9:5 and on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month they did so in the Sinai Desert. The people did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 9:6 But there were some people who were ritually unclean because they had touched a corpse, and they were not able to keep the Passover on that day. They went to Moses and Aaron 
04Nm 9:7 and said, "We are unclean because we have touched a corpse, but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD's offering with the rest of the Israelites?" 
04Nm 9:8 Moses answered, "Wait until I receive instructions from the LORD." 
04Nm 9:9 The LORD told Moses 
04Nm 9:10 to say to the people of Israel, "When any of you or your descendants are unclean from touching a corpse or are far away on a journey, but still want to keep the Passover, 
04Nm 9:11 you are permitted to observe it one month later instead, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the second month. Celebrate it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
04Nm 9:12 Do not leave any of the food until the following morning and do not break any of the animal's bones. Observe the Passover according to all the regulations. 
04Nm 9:13 But if any of you are ritually clean and not away on a journey and do not observe the Passover, you shall no longer be considered my people, because you did not present the offering to me at the appointed time. You must suffer the consequences of your sin. 
04Nm 9:14 "If foreigners living among you want to keep the Passover, they must observe it according to all the rules and regulations. The same law applies to everyone, whether native or foreigner." 
04Nm 9:15 On the day the Tent of the LORD's presence was set up, a cloud came and covered it.
04Nm 9:16 At night the cloud looked like fire. 
04Nm 9:17 Whenever the cloud lifted, the people of Israel broke camp, and they set up camp again in the place where the cloud came down. 
04Nm 9:18 The people broke camp at the command of the LORD, and at his command they set up camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the Tent, they stayed in the same camp. 
04Nm 9:19 When the cloud stayed over the Tent for a long time, they obeyed the LORD and did not move on. 
04Nm 9:20 Sometimes the cloud remained over the Tent for only a few days; in any case, they remained in camp or moved, according to the command of the LORD. 
04Nm 9:21 Sometimes the cloud remained only from evening until morning, and they moved on as soon as the cloud lifted. Whenever the cloud lifted, they moved on. 
04Nm 9:22 Whether it was two days, a month, a year, or longer, as long as the cloud remained over the Tent, they did not move on; but when it lifted, they moved. 
04Nm 9:23 They set up camp and broke camp in obedience to the commands which the LORD gave through Moses. 
04Nm 10:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 10:2 "Make two trumpets of hammered silver to use for calling the people together and for breaking camp. 
04Nm 10:3 When long blasts are sounded on both trumpets, the whole community is to gather around you at the entrance to the Tent of my presence. 
04Nm 10:4 But when only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders of the clans are to gather around you. 
04Nm 10:5 When short blasts are sounded, the tribes camped on the east will move out. 
04Nm 10:6 When short blasts are sounded a second time, the tribes on the south will move out. So short blasts are to be sounded to break camp, 
04Nm 10:7 but in order to call the community together, long blasts are to be sounded. 
04Nm 10:8 The trumpets are to be blown by Aaron's sons, the priests. "The following rule is to be observed for all time to come. 
04Nm 10:9 When you are at war in your land, defending yourselves against an enemy who has attacked you, sound the signal for battle on these trumpets. I, the LORD your God, will help you and save you from your enemies. 
04Nm 10:10 Also on joyful occasions - at your New Moon Festivals and your other religious festivals - you are to blow the trumpets when you present your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings. Then I will help you. I am the LORD your God." 
04Nm 10:11 On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year after the people left Egypt, the cloud over the Tent of the LORD's presence lifted, 
04Nm 10:12 and the Israelites started on their journey out of the Sinai Desert. The cloud came to rest in the wilderness of Paran. 
04Nm 10:13 They began to march at the command of the LORD through Moses, 
04Nm 10:14 and each time they moved, they were in the same order. Those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Judah started out first, company by company, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command. 
04Nm 10:15 Nethanel son of Zuar was in command of the tribe of Issachar, 
04Nm 10:16 and Eliab son of Helon was in command of the tribe of Zebulun. 
04Nm 10:17 Then the Tent would be taken down, and the clans of Gershon and Merari, who carried it, would start out. 
04Nm 10:18 Next, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Reuben would start out, company by company, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command. 
04Nm 10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was in command of the tribe of Simeon, 
04Nm 10:20 and Eliasaph son of Deuel was in command of the tribe of Gad. 
04Nm 10:21 Then the Levite clan of Kohath would start out, carrying the sacred objects. By the time they arrived at the next camp, the Tent had been set up again. 
04Nm 10:22 Next, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Ephraim would start out, company by company, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command. 
04Nm 10:23 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was in command of the tribe of Manasseh, 
04Nm 10:24 and Abidan son of Gideoni was in command of the tribe of Benjamin. 
04Nm 10:25 Finally, those under the banner of the division led by the tribe of Dan, serving as the rear guard of all the divisions, would start out, company by company, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command. 
04Nm 10:26 Pagiel son of Ochran was in command of the tribe of Asher, 
04Nm 10:27 and Ahira son of Enan was in command of the tribe of Naphtali. 
04Nm 10:28 This, then, was the order of march, company by company, whenever the Israelites broke camp and set out. 
04Nm 10:29 Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Jethro the Midianite, "We are about to start out for the place which the LORD said he would give us. He has promised to make Israel prosperous, so come with us, and we will share our prosperity with you." 
04Nm 10:30 Hobab answered, "No, I am going back to my native land." 
04Nm 10:31 "Please don't leave us," Moses said. "You know where we can camp in the wilderness, and you can be our guide. 
04Nm 10:32 If you come with us, we will share with you all the blessings that the LORD gives us." 
04Nm 10:33 When the people left Sinai, the holy mountain, they traveled three days. The LORD's Covenant Box always went ahead of them to find a place for them to camp. 
04Nm 10:34 As they moved on from each camp, the cloud of the LORD was over them by day. 
04Nm 10:35 Whenever the Covenant Box started out, Moses would say, "Arise, LORD; scatter your enemies and put to flight those who hate you!" 
04Nm 10:36 And whenever it stopped, he would say, "Return, LORD, to the thousands of families of Israel." 
04Nm 11:1 The people began to complain to the LORD about their troubles. When the LORD heard them, he became angry and sent fire on the people. It burned among them and destroyed one end of the camp. 
04Nm 11:2 The people cried out to Moses for help; he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down. 
04Nm 11:3 So the place was named Taberah, because there the fire of the LORD burned among them. 
04Nm 11:4 There were foreigners traveling with the Israelites. They had a strong craving for meat, and even the Israelites themselves began to complain£º "If only we could have some meat! 
04Nm 11:5 In Egypt we used to eat all the fish we wanted, and it cost us nothing. Remember the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic we had? 
04Nm 11:6 But now our strength is gone. There is nothing at all to eat - nothing but this manna day after day!" 
04Nm 11:7 (Manna was like small seeds, whitish yellow in color. 
04Nm 11:8 It fell on the camp at night along with the dew. The next morning the people would go around and gather it, grind it or pound it into flour,
04Nm 11:9 and then boil it and make it into flat cakes. It tasted like bread baked with olive oil.) 
04Nm 11:10 Moses heard all the people complaining as they stood around in groups at the entrances of their tents. He was distressed because the LORD had become angry with them, 
04Nm 11:11 and he said to the LORD, "Why have you treated me so badly? Why are you displeased with me? Why have you given me the responsibility for all these people? 
04Nm 11:12 I didn't create them or bring them to birth! Why should you ask me to act like a nurse and carry them in my arms like babies all the way to the land you promised to their ancestors? 
04Nm 11:13 Where could I get enough meat for all these people? They keep whining and asking for meat. 
04Nm 11:14 I can't be responsible for all these people by myself; it's too much for me! 
04Nm 11:15 If you are going to treat me like this, have pity on me and kill me, so that I won't have to endure your cruelty any longer." 
04Nm 11:16 The LORD said to Moses, "Assemble seventy respected men who are recognized as leaders of the people, bring them to me at the Tent of my presence, and tell them to stand there beside you. 
04Nm 11:17 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the spirit I have given you and give it to them. Then they can help you bear the responsibility for these people, and you will not have to bear it alone. 
04Nm 11:18 Now tell the people, 'Purify yourselves for tomorrow; you will have meat to eat. The LORD has heard you whining and saying that you wished you had some meat and that you were better off in Egypt. Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will have to eat it. 
04Nm 11:19 You will have to eat it not just for one or two days, or five, or ten, or even twenty days, 
04Nm 11:20 but for a whole month, until it comes out of your ears, until you are sick of it. This will happen because you have rejected the LORD who is here among you and have complained to him that you should never have left Egypt.' " 
04Nm 11:21 Moses said to the LORD, "Here I am leading 600,000 people, and you say that you will give them enough meat for a month? 
04Nm 11:22 Could enough cattle and sheep be killed to satisfy them? Are all the fish in the sea enough for them?" 
04Nm 11:23 "Is there a limit to my power?" the LORD answered. "You will soon see whether what I have said will happen or not!" 
04Nm 11:24 So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He assembled seventy of the leaders and placed them around the Tent. 
04Nm 11:25 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him. He took some of the spirit he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy leaders. When the spirit came on them, they began to shout like prophets, but not for long. 
04Nm 11:26 Two of the seventy leaders, Eldad and Medad, had stayed in the camp and had not gone out to the Tent. There in the camp the spirit came on them, and they too began to shout like prophets. 
04Nm 11:27 A young man ran out to tell Moses what Eldad and Medad were doing. 
04Nm 11:28 Then Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' helper since he was a young man, spoke up and said to Moses, "Stop them, sir!" 
04Nm 11:29 Moses answered, "Are you concerned about my interests? I wish that the LORD would give his spirit to all his people and make all of them shout like prophets!" 
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses and the seventy leaders of Israel went back to camp. 
04Nm 11:31 Suddenly the LORD sent a wind that brought quails from the sea, flying three feet above the ground. They settled on the camp and all around it for miles and miles in every direction. 
04Nm 11:32 So all that day, all night, and all the next day, the people worked catching quails; no one gathered less than fifty bushels. They spread them out to dry all around the camp. 
04Nm 11:33 While there was still plenty of meat for them to eat, the LORD became angry with the people and caused an epidemic to break out among them. 
04Nm 11:34 That place was named Kibroth Hattaavah (which means "Graves of Craving"), because there they buried the people who had craved meat. 
04Nm 11:35 From there the people moved to Hazeroth, where they made camp. 
04Nm 12:1 Moses had married a Cushite woman, and Miriam and Aaron criticized him for it. 
04Nm 12:2 They said, "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses? Hasn't he also spoken through us?" The LORD heard what they said. 
04Nm 12:3 (Moses was a humble man, more humble than anyone else on earth.) 
04Nm 12:4 Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, "I want the three of you to come out to the Tent of my presence." They went, 
04Nm 12:5 and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance of the Tent, and called out, "Aaron! Miriam!" The two of them stepped forward, 
04Nm 12:6 and the LORD said, "Now hear what I have to say! When there are prophets among you, I reveal myself to them in visions and speak to them in dreams. 
04Nm 12:7 It is different when I speak with my servant Moses; I have put him in charge of all my people Israel. 
04Nm 12:8 So I speak to him face-to-face, clearly and not in riddles; he has even seen my form! How dare you speak against my servant Moses?" 
04Nm 12:9 The LORD was angry with them; and so as he departed 
04Nm 12:10 and the cloud left the Tent, Miriam's skin was suddenly covered with a dreaded disease and turned as white as snow. When Aaron looked at her and saw that she was covered with the disease, 
04Nm 12:11 he said to Moses, "Please, sir, do not make us suffer this punishment for our foolish sin. 
04Nm 12:12 Don't let her become like something born dead with half its flesh eaten away." 
04Nm 12:13 So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, heal her!" 
04Nm 12:14 The LORD answered, "If her father had spit in her face, she would have to bear her disgrace for seven days. So let her be shut out of the camp for a week, and after that she can be brought back in." 
04Nm 12:15 Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back in. 
04Nm 12:16 Then they left Hazeroth and set up camp in the wilderness of Paran. 
04Nm 13:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 13:2 "Choose one of the leaders from each of the twelve tribes and send them as spies to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites." 
04Nm 13:3 Moses obeyed and from the wilderness of Paran he sent out leaders, as follows£º [Tribe£º Leader]
04Nm 13:4 Reuben£º Shammua son of Zaccur,
04Nm 13:5 Simeon£º Shaphat son of Hori,
04Nm 13:6 Judah£º Caleb son of Jephunneh,
04Nm 13:7 Issachar£º Igal son of Joseph,
04Nm 13:8 Ephraim£º Hoshea son of Nun,
04Nm 13:9 Benjamin£º Palti son of Raphu,
04Nm 13:10 Zebulun£º Gaddiel son of Sodi,
04Nm 13:11 Manasseh£º Gaddi son of Susi,
04Nm 13:12 Dan£º Ammiel son of Gemalli,
04Nm 13:13 Asher£º Sethur son of Michael,
04Nm 13:14 Naphtali£º Nahbi son of Vophsi,
04Nm 13:15 Gad£º Geuel son of Machi.
04Nm 13:16 These are the spies Moses sent to explore the land. He changed the name of Hoshea son of Nun to Joshua. 
04Nm 13:17 When Moses sent them out, he said to them, "Go north from here into the southern part of the land of Canaan and then on into the hill country. 
04Nm 13:18 Find out what kind of country it is, how many people live there, and how strong they are. 
04Nm 13:19 Find out whether the land is good or bad and whether the people live in open towns or in fortified cities. 
04Nm 13:20 Find out whether the soil is fertile and whether the land is wooded. And be sure to bring back some of the fruit that grows there." (It was the season when grapes were beginning to ripen.) 
04Nm 13:21 So the men went north and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin in the south all the way to Rehob, near Hamath Pass in the north. 
04Nm 13:22 They went first into the southern part of the land and came to Hebron, where the clans of Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of a race of giants called the Anakim, lived. (Hebron was founded seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
04Nm 13:23 They came to Eshcol Valley, and there they cut off a branch which had one bunch of grapes on it so heavy that it took two men to carry it on a pole between them. They also brought back some pomegranates and figs. 
04Nm 13:24 (That place was named Eshcol Valley because of the bunch of grapes the Israelites cut off there.) 
04Nm 13:25 After exploring the land for forty days, the spies returned 
04Nm 13:26 to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They reported what they had seen and showed them the fruit they had brought. 
04Nm 13:27 They told Moses, "We explored the land and found it to be rich and fertile; and here is some of its fruit. 
04Nm 13:28 But the people who live there are powerful, and their cities are very large and well fortified. Even worse, we saw the descendants of the giants there. 
04Nm 13:29 Amalekites live in the southern part of the land; Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and Canaanites live by the Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan River." 
04Nm 13:30 Caleb silenced the people who were complaining against Moses, and said, "We should attack now and take the land; we are strong enough to conquer it." 
04Nm 13:31 But the men who had gone with Caleb said, "No, we are not strong enough to attack them; the people there are more powerful than we are." 
04Nm 13:32 So they spread a false report among the Israelites about the land they had explored. They said, "That land doesn't even produce enough to feed the people who live there. Everyone we saw was very tall, 
04Nm 13:33 and we even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak. We felt as small as grasshoppers, and that is how we must have looked to them." 
04Nm 14:1 All night long the people cried out in distress. 
04Nm 14:2 They complained against Moses and Aaron, and said, "It would have been better to die in Egypt or even here in the wilderness! 
04Nm 14:3 Why is the LORD taking us into that land? We will be killed in battle, and our wives and children will be captured. Wouldn't it be better to go back to Egypt?" 
04Nm 14:4 So they said to one another, "Let's choose a leader and go back to Egypt!" 
04Nm 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron bowed to the ground in front of all the people. 
04Nm 14:6 And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of the spies, tore their clothes in sorrow 
04Nm 14:7 and said to the people, "The land we explored is an excellent land. 
04Nm 14:8 If the LORD is pleased with us, he will take us there and give us that rich and fertile land. 
04Nm 14:9 Do not rebel against the LORD and don't be afraid of the people who live there. We will conquer them easily. The LORD is with us and has defeated the gods who protected them; so don't be afraid." 
04Nm 14:10 The whole community was threatening to stone them to death, but suddenly the people saw the dazzling light of the LORD's presence appear over the Tent. 
04Nm 14:11 The LORD said to Moses, "How much longer will these people reject me? How much longer will they refuse to trust in me, even though I have performed so many miracles among them? 
04Nm 14:12 I will send an epidemic and destroy them, but I will make you the father of a nation that is larger and more powerful than they are!" 
04Nm 14:13 But Moses said to the LORD, "You brought these people out of Egypt by your power. When the Egyptians hear what you have done to your people, 
04Nm 14:14 they will tell it to the people who live in this land. These people have already heard that you, LORD, are with us, that you appear in plain sight when your cloud stops over us, and that you go before us in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. 
04Nm 14:15 Now if you kill all your people, the nations who have heard of your fame will say 
04Nm 14:16 that you killed your people in the wilderness because you were not able to bring them into the land you promised to give them. 
04Nm 14:17 So now, LORD, I pray, show us your power and do what you promised when you said, 
04Nm 14:18 'I, the LORD, am not easily angered, and I show great love and faithfulness and forgive sin and rebellion. Yet I will not fail to punish children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for the sins of their parents.' 
04Nm 14:19 And now, LORD, according to the greatness of your unchanging love, forgive, I pray, the sin of these people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt." 
04Nm 14:20 The LORD answered, "I will forgive them, as you have asked. 
04Nm 14:21 But I promise that as surely as I live and as surely as my presence fills the earth, 
04Nm 14:22 none of these people will live to enter that land. They have seen the dazzling light of my presence and the miracles that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, but they have tried my patience over and over again and have refused to obey me. 
04Nm 14:23 They will never enter the land which I promised to their ancestors. None of those who have rejected me will ever enter it. 
04Nm 14:24 But because my servant Caleb has a different attitude and has remained loyal to me, I will bring him into the land which he explored, and his descendants will possess the land 
04Nm 14:25 in whose valleys the Amalekites and the Canaanites now live. Turn back tomorrow and go into the wilderness in the direction of the Gulf of Aqaba." 
04Nm 14:26 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 14:27 "How much longer are these wicked people going to complain against me? I have heard enough of these complaints! 
04Nm 14:28 Now give them this answer£º 'I swear that as surely as I live, I will do to you just what you have asked. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
04Nm 14:29 You will die and your corpses will be scattered across this wilderness. Because you have complained against me, none of you over twenty years of age will enter that land. 
04Nm 14:30 I promised to let you live there, but not one of you will, except Caleb and Joshua. 
04Nm 14:31 You said that your children would be captured, but I will bring them into the land that you rejected, and it will be their home. 
04Nm 14:32 You will die here in this wilderness. 
04Nm 14:33 Your children will wander in the wilderness for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last one of you dies. 
04Nm 14:34 You will suffer the consequences of your sin for forty years, one year for each of the forty days you spent exploring the land. You will know what it means to have me against you! 
04Nm 14:35 I swear that I will do this to you wicked people who have gathered together against me. Here in the wilderness every one of you will die. I, the LORD, have spoken.' " 
04Nm 14:36 The men Moses had sent to explore the land brought back a false report which caused the people to complain against the LORD.
04Nm 14:37 And so the LORD struck them with a disease, and they died. 
04Nm 14:38 Of the twelve spies only Joshua and Caleb survived. 
04Nm 14:39 When Moses told the Israelites what the LORD had said, they mourned bitterly. 
04Nm 14:40 Early the next morning they started out to invade the hill country, saying, "Now we are ready to go to the place which the LORD told us about. We admit that we have sinned." 
04Nm 14:41 But Moses said, "Then why are you disobeying the LORD now? You will not succeed! 
04Nm 14:42 Don't go. The LORD is not with you, and your enemies will defeat you. 
04Nm 14:43 When you face the Amalekites and the Canaanites, you will die in battle; the LORD will not be with you, because you have refused to follow him." 
04Nm 14:44 Yet they still dared to go up into the hill country, even though neither the LORD's Covenant Box nor Moses left the camp. 
04Nm 14:45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived there attacked and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hormah. 
04Nm 15:1 The LORD gave Moses 
04Nm 15:2 the following regulations for the people of Israel to observe in the land that he was going to give them. 
04Nm 15:3 A bull, a ram, a sheep, or a goat may be presented to the LORD as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice in fulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering or as an offering at your regular religious festivals; the odor of these food offerings is pleasing to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:4 Whoever presents a sheep or a goat as a burnt offering to the LORD is to bring with each animal 2 pounds of flour mixed with 2 pints of olive oil as a grain offering,
04Nm 15:5 together with 2 pints of wine. 
04Nm 15:6 When a ram is offered, 4 pounds of flour mixed with 3 pints of olive oil are to be presented as a grain offering, 
04Nm 15:7 together with 3 pints of wine. The odor of these sacrifices is pleasing to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:8 When a bull is offered to the LORD as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice in fulfillment of a vow or as a fellowship offering, 
04Nm 15:9 a grain offering of 6 pounds of flour mixed with 4 pints of olive oil is to be presented, 
04Nm 15:10 together with 4 pints of wine. The odor of this sacrifice is pleasing to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:11 That is what shall be offered with each bull, ram, sheep, or goat. 
04Nm 15:12 When more than one animal is offered, the accompanying offering is to be increased proportionately. 
04Nm 15:13 All native Israelites are to do this when they present a food offering, an odor pleasing to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:14 And if at any time foreigners living among you, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis, make a food offering, an odor that pleases the LORD, they are to observe the same regulations. 
04Nm 15:15 For all time to come, the same rules are binding on you and on the foreigners who live among you. You and they are alike in the LORD's sight; 
04Nm 15:16 the same laws and regulations apply to you and to them. 
04Nm 15:17 The LORD gave Moses 
04Nm 15:18 the following regulations for the people of Israel to observe in the land that he was going to give them. 
04Nm 15:19 When any food produced there is eaten, some of it is to be set aside as a special contribution to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:20 When you bake bread, the first loaf of the first bread made from the new grain is to be presented as a special contribution to the LORD. This is to be presented in the same way as the special contribution you make from the grain you thresh. 
04Nm 15:21 For all time to come, this special gift is to be given to the LORD from the bread you bake. 
04Nm 15:22 But suppose someone unintentionally fails to keep some of these regulations which the LORD has given Moses. 
04Nm 15:23 And suppose that in the future the community fails to do everything that the LORD commanded through Moses. 
04Nm 15:24 If the mistake was made because of the ignorance of the community, they are to offer a bull as a burnt offering, an odor that pleases the LORD, with the proper grain offering and wine offering. In addition, they are to offer a male goat as a sin offering. 
04Nm 15:25 The priest shall perform the ritual of purification for the community, and they will be forgiven, because the mistake was unintentional and they brought their sin offering as a food offering to the LORD. 
04Nm 15:26 The whole community of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven, because everyone was involved in the mistake. 
04Nm 15:27 If any of you sin unintentionally, you are to offer a one-year-old female goat as a sin offering. 
04Nm 15:28 At the altar the priest shall perform the ritual of purification to purify you from your sin, and you will be forgiven. 
04Nm 15:29 The same regulation applies to all who unintentionally commit a sin, whether they are native Israelites or resident foreigners. 
04Nm 15:30 But any who sin deliberately, whether they are natives or foreigners, are guilty of treating the LORD with contempt, and they shall be put to death, 
04Nm 15:31 because they have rejected what the LORD said and have deliberately broken one of his commands. They are responsible for their own death. 
04Nm 15:32 Once, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath. 
04Nm 15:33 He was taken to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community, 
04Nm 15:34 and was put under guard, because it was not clear what should be done with him. 
04Nm 15:35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must be put to death; the whole community is to stone him to death outside the camp." 
04Nm 15:36 So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded. 
04Nm 15:37 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 15:38 to say to the people of Israel£º "Make tassels on the corners of your garments and put a blue cord on each tassel. You are to do this for all time to come. 
04Nm 15:39 The tassels will serve as reminders, and each time you see them you will remember all my commands and obey them; then you will not turn away from me and follow your own wishes and desires. 
04Nm 15:40 The tassels will remind you to keep all my commands, and you will belong completely to me. 
04Nm 15:41 I am the LORD your God; I brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD." 
04Nm 16:1 Korah son of Izhar, from the Levite clan of Kohath, rebelled against the leadership of Moses. He was joined by three members of the tribe of Reuben - 
04Nm 16:2 Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth - and by 250 other Israelites, well-known leaders chosen by the community. 
04Nm 16:3 They assembled before Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! All the members of the community belong to the LORD, and the LORD is with all of us. Why, then, Moses, do you set yourself above the LORD's community?" 
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard this, he threw himself on the ground and prayed. 
04Nm 16:5 Then he said to Korah and his followers, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will show us who belongs to him; he will let the one who belongs to him, that is, the one he has chosen, approach him at the altar. 
04Nm 16:6 Tomorrow morning you and your followers take fire pans, put live coals and incense on them, and take them to the altar.
04Nm 16:7 Then we will see which of us the LORD has chosen. You Levites are the ones who have gone too far!" 
04Nm 16:8 Moses continued to speak to Korah. "Listen, you Levites! 
04Nm 16:9 Do you consider it a small matter that the God of Israel has set you apart from the rest of the community, so that you can approach him, perform your service in the LORD's Tent, and minister to the community and serve them? 
04Nm 16:10 He has let you and all the other Levites have this honor - and now you are trying to get the priesthood too! 
04Nm 16:11 When you complain against Aaron, it is really against the LORD that you and your followers are rebelling." 
04Nm 16:12 Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said, "We will not come! 
04Nm 16:13 Isn't it enough that you have brought us out of the fertile land of Egypt to kill us here in the wilderness? Do you also have to lord it over us? 
04Nm 16:14 You certainly have not brought us into a fertile land or given us fields and vineyards as our possession, and now you are trying to deceive us. We will not come!" 
04Nm 16:15 Moses became angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept any offerings these men bring. I have not wronged any of them; I have not even taken one of their donkeys." 
04Nm 16:16 Moses said to Korah, "Tomorrow you and your 250 followers must come to the Tent of the LORD's presence; Aaron will also be there. 
04Nm 16:17 Each of you will take his fire pan, put incense on it, and then present it at the altar." 
04Nm 16:18 So they each took their fire pans, put live coals and incense on them, and stood at the entrance of the Tent with Moses and Aaron. 
04Nm 16:19 Then Korah gathered the whole community, and they stood facing Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the Tent. Suddenly the dazzling light of the LORD's presence appeared to the whole community, 
04Nm 16:20 and the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 16:21 "Move back from these people, and I will destroy them immediately." 
04Nm 16:22 But Moses and Aaron bowed down with their faces to the ground and said, "O God, you are the source of all life. When one of us sins, do you become angry with the whole community?" 
04Nm 16:23 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 16:24 "Tell the people to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram." 
04Nm 16:25 Then Moses, accompanied by the leaders of Israel, went to Dathan and Abiram. 
04Nm 16:26 He said to the people, "Get away from the tents of these wicked men and don't touch anything that belongs to them. Otherwise, you will be wiped out with them for all their sins." 
04Nm 16:27 So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at the entrance of their tents, with their wives and children. 
04Nm 16:28 Moses said to the people, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it is not by my own choice that I have done them. 
04Nm 16:29 If these men die a natural death without some punishment from God, then the LORD did not send me. 
04Nm 16:30 But if the LORD does something unheard of, and the earth opens up and swallows them with all they own, so that they go down alive to the world of the dead, you will know that these men have rejected the LORD." 
04Nm 16:31 As soon as he had finished speaking, the ground under Dathan and Abiram split open 
04Nm 16:32 and swallowed them and their families, together with all of Korah's followers and their possessions. 
04Nm 16:33 So they went down alive to the world of the dead, with their possessions. The earth closed over them, and they vanished. 
04Nm 16:34 All the people of Israel who were there fled when they heard their cry. They shouted, "Run! The earth might swallow us too!" 
04Nm 16:35 Then the LORD sent a fire that blazed out and burned up the 250 men who had presented the incense. 
04Nm 16:36 Then the LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 16:37 "Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the bronze fire pans from the remains of those who have been burned, and scatter the coals from the fire pans somewhere else, because the fire pans are holy. 
04Nm 16:38 They became holy when they were presented at the LORD's altar. So take the fire pans of these who were put to death for their sin, beat them into thin plates, and make a covering for the altar. It will be a warning to the people of Israel." 
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the fire pans and had them beaten into thin plates to make a covering for the altar. 
04Nm 16:40 This was a warning to the Israelites that no one who was not a descendant of Aaron should come to the altar to burn incense for the LORD. Otherwise he would be destroyed like Korah and his men. All this was done as the LORD had commanded Eleazar through Moses. 
04Nm 16:41 The next day the whole community complained against Moses and Aaron and said, "You have killed some of the LORD's people." 
04Nm 16:42 After they had all gathered to protest to Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the Tent and saw that the cloud was covering it and that the dazzling light of the LORD's presence had appeared. 
04Nm 16:43 Moses and Aaron went and stood in front of the Tent, 
04Nm 16:44 and the LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 16:45 "Move back from these people, and I will destroy them on the spot!" The two of them bowed down with their faces to the ground, 
04Nm 16:46 and Moses said to Aaron, "Take your fire pan, put live coals from the altar in it, and put some incense on the coals. Then hurry with it to the people and perform the ritual of purification for them. Hurry! The LORD's anger has already broken out and an epidemic has already begun." 
04Nm 16:47 Aaron obeyed, took his fire pan and ran into the middle of the assembled people. When he saw that the plague had already begun, he put the incense on the coals and performed the ritual of purification for the people. 
04Nm 16:48 This stopped the plague, and he was left standing between the living and the dead. 
04Nm 16:49 The number of people who died was 14,700, not counting those who died in Korah's rebellion. 
04Nm 16:50 When the plague had stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent. 
04Nm 17:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 17:2 "Tell the people of Israel to give you twelve walking sticks, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man's name on his stick 
04Nm 17:3 and then write Aaron's name on the stick representing Levi. There will be one stick for each tribal leader. 
04Nm 17:4 Take them to the Tent of my presence and put them in front of the Covenant Box, where I meet you. 
04Nm 17:5 Then the stick of the man I have chosen will sprout. In this way I will put a stop to the constant complaining of these Israelites against you." 
04Nm 17:6 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a stick, one for each tribe, twelve in all, and Aaron's stick was put with them. 
04Nm 17:7 Moses then put all the sticks in the Tent in front of the LORD's Covenant Box. 
04Nm 17:8 The next day, when Moses went into the Tent, he saw that Aaron's stick, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted. It had budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds! 
04Nm 17:9 Moses took all the sticks and showed them to the Israelites. They saw what had happened, and each leader took his own stick back. 
04Nm 17:10 The LORD said to Moses, "Put Aaron's stick back in front of the Covenant Box. It is to be kept as a warning to the rebel Israelites that they will die unless their complaining stops." 
04Nm 17:11 Moses did as the LORD commanded. 
04Nm 17:12 The people of Israel said to Moses, "Then that's the end of us! 
04Nm 17:13 If anyone who even comes near the Tent must die, then we are all as good as dead!" 
04Nm 18:1 The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and the Levites must suffer the consequences of any guilt connected with serving in the Tent of my presence; but only you and your sons will suffer the consequences of service in the priesthood. 
04Nm 18:2 Bring in your relatives, the tribe of Levi, to work with you and help you while you and your sons are serving at the Tent. 
04Nm 18:3 They are to fulfill their duties to you and their responsibilities for the Tent, but they must not have any contact with sacred objects in the Holy Place or with the altar. If they do, both they and you will be put to death. 
04Nm 18:4 They are to work with you and fulfill their responsibilities for all the service in the Tent, but no unqualified person may work with you. 
04Nm 18:5 You and your sons alone must fulfill the responsibilities for the Holy Place and the altar, so that my anger will not again break out against the people of Israel. 
04Nm 18:6 I am the one who has chosen your relatives the Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you. They are dedicated to me, so that they can carry out their duties in the Tent. 
04Nm 18:7 But you and your sons alone shall fulfill all the responsibilities of the priesthood that concern the altar and what is in the Most Holy Place. These things are your responsibility, because I have given you the gift of the priesthood. Any unqualified person who comes near the sacred objects shall be put to death." 
04Nm 18:8 The LORD said to Aaron, "Remember that I am giving you all the special contributions made to me that are not burned as sacrifices. I am giving them to you and to your descendants as the part assigned to you forever. 
04Nm 18:9 Of the most sacred offerings not burned on the altar, the following belong to you£º the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the repayment offerings. Everything that is presented to me as a sacred offering belongs to you and your sons. 
04Nm 18:10 You must eat these things in a holy place, and only males may eat them; consider them holy. 
04Nm 18:11 "In addition, any other special contributions that the Israelites present to me shall be yours. I am giving them to you, your sons, and your daughters for all time to come. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat them. 
04Nm 18:12 "I am giving you all the best of the first produce which the Israelites give me each year£º olive oil, wine, and grain. 
04Nm 18:13 It all belongs to you. Every member of your family who is ritually clean may eat it. 
04Nm 18:14 "Everything in Israel that has been unconditionally dedicated to me belongs to you. 
04Nm 18:15 "Every first-born child or animal that the Israelites present to me belongs to you. But you must accept payment to buy back every first-born child, and must also accept payment for every first-born animal that is ritually unclean. 
04Nm 18:16 Children shall be bought back at the age of one month for the fixed price of five pieces of silver, according to the official standard. 
04Nm 18:17 But the first-born of cows, sheep, and goats are not to be bought back; they belong completely to me and are to be sacrificed. Throw their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, an odor pleasing to me. 
04Nm 18:18 The meat from them belongs to you, like the breast and the right hind leg of the special offering. 
04Nm 18:19 "I am giving to you, to your sons, and to your daughters, for all time to come, all the special contributions which the Israelites present to me. This is an unbreakable covenant that I have made with you and your descendants." 
04Nm 18:20 The LORD said to Aaron, "You will not receive any property that can be inherited, and no part of the land of Israel will be assigned to you. I, the LORD, am all you need." 
04Nm 18:21 The LORD said, "I have given to the Levites every tithe that the people of Israel present to me. This is in payment for their service in taking care of the Tent of my presence. 
04Nm 18:22 The other Israelites must no longer approach the Tent and in this way bring on themselves the penalty of death. 
04Nm 18:23 From now on only the Levites will take care of the Tent and bear the full responsibility for it. This is a permanent rule that applies also to your descendants. The Levites shall have no permanent property in Israel, 
04Nm 18:24 because I have given to them as their possession the tithe which the Israelites present to me as a special contribution. That is why I told them that they would have no permanent property in Israel." 
04Nm 18:25 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 18:26 to say to the Levites£º "When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that the LORD gives you as your possession, you must present a tenth of it as a special contribution to the LORD. 
04Nm 18:27 This special contribution will be considered as the equivalent of the offering which the farmer makes of new grain and new wine. 
04Nm 18:28 In this way you also will present the special contribution that belongs to the LORD from all the tithes which you receive from the Israelites. You are to give this special contribution for the LORD to Aaron the priest. 
04Nm 18:29 Give it from the best that you receive. 
04Nm 18:30 When you have presented the best part, you may keep the rest, just as the farmer keeps what is left after he makes his offering. 
04Nm 18:31 You and your families may eat the rest anywhere, because it is your wages for your service in the Tent. 
04Nm 18:32 You will not become guilty when you eat it, as long as you have presented the best of it to the LORD. But be sure not to profane the sacred gifts of the Israelites by eating any of the gifts before the best part is offered; if you do, you will be put to death." 
04Nm 19:1 The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron 
04Nm 19:2 to give the Israelites the following regulations. Bring to Moses and Aaron a red cow which has no defects and which has never been worked, 
04Nm 19:3 and they will give it to Eleazar the priest. It is to be taken outside the camp and killed in his presence. 
04Nm 19:4 Then Eleazar is to take some of its blood and with his finger sprinkle it seven times in the direction of the Tent. 
04Nm 19:5 The whole animal, including skin, meat, blood, and intestines, is to be burned in the presence of the priest. 
04Nm 19:6 Then he is to take some cedar wood, a sprig of hyssop, and a red cord and throw them into the fire. 
04Nm 19:7 After that, he is to wash his clothes and pour water over himself, and then he may enter the camp; but he remains ritually unclean until evening. 
04Nm 19:8 The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and pour water over himself, but he also remains unclean until evening. 
04Nm 19:9 Then someone who is ritually clean is to collect the ashes of the cow and put them in a ritually clean place outside the camp, where they are to be kept for the Israelite community to use in preparing the water for removing ritual uncleanness. This ritual is performed to remove sin. 
04Nm 19:10 The one who collected the ashes must wash his clothes, but he remains unclean until evening. This regulation is valid for all time to come, both for the Israelites and for the foreigners living among them. 
04Nm 19:11 Those who touch a corpse are ritually unclean for seven days. 
04Nm 19:12 They must purify themselves with the water for purification on the third day and on the seventh day, and then they will be clean. But if they do not purify themselves on both the third and the seventh day, they will not be clean. 
04Nm 19:13 Those who touch a corpse and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the LORD's Tent, and they will no longer be considered God's people. 
04Nm 19:14 In the case of a person who dies in a tent, anyone who is in the tent at the time of death or who enters it becomes ritually unclean for seven days. 
04Nm 19:15 Every jar and pot in the tent that has no lid on it also becomes unclean. 
04Nm 19:16 If any touch a person who has been killed or has died a natural death outdoors or if any touch a human bone or a grave, they become unclean for seven days. 
04Nm 19:17 To remove the uncleanness, some ashes from the red cow which was burned to remove sin shall be taken and put in a pot, and fresh water added. 
04Nm 19:18 In the first case, someone who is ritually clean is to take a sprig of hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, everything in it, and the people who were there. In the second case, someone who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on those who had touched the human bone or the dead body or the grave. 
04Nm 19:19 On the third day and on the seventh the person who is ritually clean is to sprinkle the water on the unclean persons. On the seventh day he is to purify those, who, after washing their clothes and pouring water over themselves, become ritually clean at sunset. 
04Nm 19:20 Those who have become ritually unclean and do not purify themselves remain unclean, because the water for purification has not been thrown over them. They defile the LORD's Tent and will no longer be considered God's people. 
04Nm 19:21 You are to observe this rule for all time to come. The person who sprinkles the water for purification must also wash his clothes; anyone who touches the water remains ritually unclean until evening. 
04Nm 19:22 Whatever an unclean person touches is unclean, and anyone else who touches it remains unclean until evening. 
04Nm 20:1 In the first month the whole community of Israel came to the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. 
04Nm 20:2 There was no water where they camped, so the people gathered around Moses and Aaron 
04Nm 20:3 and complained£º "It would have been better if we had died in front of the LORD's Tent along with the other Israelites. 
04Nm 20:4 Why have you brought us out into this wilderness? Just so that we can die here with our animals? 
04Nm 20:5 Why did you bring us out of Egypt into this miserable place where nothing will grow? There's no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates. There is not even any water to drink!" 
04Nm 20:6 Moses and Aaron moved away from the people and stood at the entrance of the Tent. They bowed down with their faces to the ground, and the dazzling light of the LORD's presence appeared to them. 
04Nm 20:7 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 20:8 "Take the stick that is in front of the Covenant Box, and then you and Aaron assemble the whole community. There in front of them all speak to that rock over there, and water will gush out of it. In this way you will bring water out of the rock for the people, for them and their animals to drink." 
04Nm 20:9 Moses went and got the stick, as the LORD had commanded. 
04Nm 20:10 He and Aaron assembled the whole community in front of the rock, and Moses said, "Listen, you rebels! Do we have to get water out of this rock for you?" 
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses raised the stick and struck the rock twice with it, and a great stream of water gushed out, and all the people and animals drank. 
04Nm 20:12 But the LORD reprimanded Moses and Aaron. He said, "Because you did not have enough faith to acknowledge my holy power before the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land that I promised to give them." 
04Nm 20:13 This happened at Meribah, where the people of Israel complained against the LORD and where he showed them that he is holy. 
04Nm 20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. They said, "This message is from your kinsmen, the tribes of Israel. You know the hardships we have suffered, 
04Nm 20:15 how our ancestors went to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated our ancestors and us, 
04Nm 20:16 and we cried to the LORD for help. He heard our cry and sent an angel, who led us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town at the border of your territory. 
04Nm 20:17 Please permit us to pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road or go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink from your wells. We will stay on the main road until we are out of your territory." 
04Nm 20:18 But the Edomites answered, "We refuse to let you pass through our country! If you try, we will march out and attack you." 
04Nm 20:19 The people of Israel said, "We will stay on the main road, and if we or our animals drink any of your water, we will pay for it - all we want is to pass through." 
04Nm 20:20 The Edomites repeated, "We refuse!" and they marched out with a powerful army to attack the people of Israel. 
04Nm 20:21 Because the Edomites would not let the Israelites pass through their territory, the Israelites turned and went another way. 
04Nm 20:22 The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor, 
04Nm 20:23 on the border of Edom. There the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 20:24 "Aaron is not going to enter the land which I promised to give to Israel; he is going to die, because the two of you rebelled against my command at Meribah. 
04Nm 20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor, 
04Nm 20:26 and there remove Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. Aaron is going to die there." 
04Nm 20:27 Moses did what the LORD had commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community, 
04Nm 20:28 and Moses removed Aaron's priestly robes and put them on Eleazar. There on the top of the mountain Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar came back down. 
04Nm 20:29 The whole community learned that Aaron had died, and they all mourned for him for thirty days. 
04Nm 21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad in the southern part of Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming by way of Atharim, he attacked them and captured some of them. 
04Nm 21:2 Then the Israelites made a vow to the LORD£º "If you will let us conquer these people, we will unconditionally dedicate them and their cities to you and will destroy them." 
04Nm 21:3 The LORD heard them and helped them conquer the Canaanites. So the Israelites completely destroyed them and their cities, and named the place Hormah. 
04Nm 21:4 The Israelites left Mount Hor by the road that leads to the Gulf of Aqaba, in order to go around the territory of Edom. But on the way the people lost their patience 
04Nm 21:5 and spoke against God and Moses. They complained, "Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no food or water? We can't stand any more of this miserable food!" 
04Nm 21:6 Then the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many Israelites were bitten and died. 
04Nm 21:7 The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Now pray to the LORD to take these snakes away." So Moses prayed for the people. 
04Nm 21:8 Then the LORD told Moses to make a metal snake and put it on a pole, so that anyone who was bitten could look at it and be healed. 
04Nm 21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who had been bitten would look at the bronze snake and be healed. 
04Nm 21:10 The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. 
04Nm 21:11 After leaving that place, they camped at the ruins of Abarim in the wilderness east of Moabite territory. 
04Nm 21:12 Then they camped in Zered Valley. 
04Nm 21:13 From there they moved again and camped on the north side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness which extends into Amorite territory. (The Arnon was the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.) 
04Nm 21:14 That is why {\I The Book of the LORD's Battles speaks of "...the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the valleys; the Arnon River,
04Nm 21:15 and the slope of the valleys that extend to the town of Ar and toward the border of Moab." 
04Nm 21:16 From there they went on to a place called Wells, where the LORD said to Moses, "Bring the people together, and I will give them water." 
04Nm 21:17 At that time the people of Israel sang this song£º "Wells, produce your water; And we will greet it with a song - 
04Nm 21:18 The well dug by princes And by leaders of the people, Dug with a royal scepter And with their walking sticks." They moved from the wilderness to Mattanah, 
04Nm 21:19 and from there they went on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
04Nm 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of the Moabites, below the top of Mount Pisgah, looking out over the desert. 
04Nm 21:21 Then the people of Israel sent messengers to the Amorite king Sihon to say£º 
04Nm 21:22 "Let us pass through your land. We and our cattle will not leave the road and go into your fields or vineyards, and we will not drink water from your wells; we will stay on the main road until we are out of your territory." 
04Nm 21:23 But Sihon would not permit the people of Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered his army and went out to Jahaz in the wilderness and attacked the Israelites. 
04Nm 21:24 But the Israelites killed many of the enemy in battle and occupied their land from the Arnon River north to the Jabbok, that is, to the Ammonites, because the Ammonite border was strongly defended. 
04Nm 21:25 So the people of Israel captured all the Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all the surrounding towns, and settled in them. 
04Nm 21:26 Heshbon was the capital city of the Amorite king Sihon, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had captured all his land as far as the Arnon River. 
04Nm 21:27 That is why the poets sing, "Come to Heshbon, to King Sihon's city! We want to see it rebuilt and restored. 
04Nm 21:28 Once from this city of Heshbon Sihon's army went forth like a fire; It destroyed the city of Ar in Moab And devoured the hills of the upper Arnon. 
04Nm 21:29 How terrible for you, people of Moab! You worshipers of Chemosh are brought to ruin! Your god let the men become refugees, And the women became captives of the Amorite king. 
04Nm 21:30 But now their descendants are destroyed, All the way from Heshbon to Dibon, From Nashim to Nophah, near Medeba." 
04Nm 21:31 So the people of Israel settled in the territory of the Amorites, 
04Nm 21:32 and Moses sent men to find the best way to attack the city of Jazer. The Israelites captured it and its surrounding towns and drove out the Amorites living there. 
04Nm 21:33 Then the Israelites turned and took the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan marched out with his army to attack them at Edrei. 
04Nm 21:34 The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him. I will give you victory over him, all his people, and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon." 
04Nm 21:35 So the Israelites killed Og, his sons, and all his people, leaving no survivors, and then they occupied his land. 
04Nm 22:1 The Israelites moved on and set up camp in the plains of Moab east of the Jordan and opposite Jericho. 
04Nm 22:2 When the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, heard what the Israelites had done to the Amorites and how many Israelites there were, 
04Nm 22:3 he and all his people became terrified. 
04Nm 22:4 The Moabites said to the leaders of the Midianites, "This horde will soon destroy everything around us, like a bull eating the grass in a pasture." So King Balak 
04Nm 22:5 sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor near the Euphrates River in the land of Amaw. They brought him this message from Balak£º "I want you to know that a whole nation has come from Egypt; its people are spreading out everywhere and threatening to take over our land. 
04Nm 22:6 They outnumber us, so please come and put a curse on them for me. Then perhaps we will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that when you pronounce a blessing, people are blessed, and when you pronounce a curse, they are placed under a curse." 
04Nm 22:7 So the Moabite and Midianite leaders took with them the payment for the curse, went to Balaam, and gave him Balak's message. 
04Nm 22:8 Balaam said to them, "Spend the night here, and tomorrow I will report to you whatever the LORD tells me." So the Moabite leaders stayed with Balaam. 
04Nm 22:9 God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these people that are staying with you?" 
04Nm 22:10 He answered, "King Balak of Moab has sent them to tell me 
04Nm 22:11 that a people who came from Egypt has spread out over the whole land. He wants me to curse them for him, so that he can fight them and drive them out." 
04Nm 22:12 God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them, and do not put a curse on the people of Israel, because they have my blessing." 
04Nm 22:13 The next morning Balaam went to Balak's messengers and said, "Go back home; the LORD has refused to let me go with you." 
04Nm 22:14 So they returned to Balak and told him that Balaam had refused to come with them. 
04Nm 22:15 Then Balak sent a larger number of leaders, who were more important than the first. 
04Nm 22:16 They went to Balaam and gave him this message from Balak£º "Please don't let anything prevent you from coming to me! 
04Nm 22:17 I will reward you richly and do anything you say. Please come and curse these people for me." 
04Nm 22:18 But Balaam answered, "Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not disobey the command of the LORD my God in even the smallest matter. 
04Nm 22:19 But please spend the night, as the others did, so that I may learn whether or not the LORD has something else to tell me." 
04Nm 22:20 That night God came to Balaam and said, "If these men have come to ask you to go with them, get ready and go, but do only what I tell you." 
04Nm 22:21 So the next morning Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite leaders. 
04Nm 22:22 God was angry that Balaam was going, and as Balaam was riding along on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants, the angel of the LORD stood in the road to bar his way. 
04Nm 22:23 When the donkey saw the angel standing there holding a sword, it left the road and turned into the fields. Balaam beat the donkey and brought it back onto the road. 
04Nm 22:24 Then the angel stood where the road narrowed between two vineyards and had a stone wall on each side. 
04Nm 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel, it moved over against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it. Again Balaam beat the donkey. 
04Nm 22:26 Once more the angel moved ahead; he stood in a narrow place where there was no room at all to pass on either side. 
04Nm 22:27 This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down. Balaam lost his temper and began to beat the donkey with his stick. 
04Nm 22:28 Then the LORD gave the donkey the power of speech, and it said to Balaam, "What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times?" 
04Nm 22:29 Balaam answered, "Because you have made a fool of me! If I had a sword, I would kill you." 
04Nm 22:30 The donkey replied, "Am I not the same donkey on which you have ridden all your life? Have I ever treated you like this before?" "No," he answered. 
04Nm 22:31 Then the LORD let Balaam see the angel standing there with his sword; and Balaam threw himself face downward on the ground. 
04Nm 22:32 The angel demanded, "Why have you beaten your donkey three times like this? I have come to bar your way, because you should not be making this journey. 
04Nm 22:33 But your donkey saw me and turned aside three times. If it hadn't, I would have killed you and spared the donkey." 
04Nm 22:34 Balaam replied, "I have sinned. I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me; but now if you think it is wrong for me to go on, I will return home." 
04Nm 22:35 But the angel said, "Go on with these men, but say only what I tell you to say." So Balaam went on with them. 
04Nm 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at Ar, a city on the Arnon River at the border of Moab. 
04Nm 22:37 Balak said to him, "Why didn't you come when I sent for you the first time? Did you think I wasn't able to reward you enough?" 
04Nm 22:38 Balaam answered, "I came, didn't I? But now, what power do I have? I can say only what God tells me to say." 
04Nm 22:39 So Balaam went with Balak to the town of Huzoth, 
04Nm 22:40 where Balak slaughtered cattle and sheep and gave some of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him. 
04Nm 22:41 The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, from where Balaam could see a part of the people of Israel. 
04Nm 23:1 He said to Balak, "Build seven altars here for me, and bring me seven bulls and seven rams." 
04Nm 23:2 Balak did as he was told, and he and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04Nm 23:3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I go to see whether or not the LORD will meet me. I will tell you whatever he reveals to me." So he went alone to the top of a hill, 
04Nm 23:4 and God met him. Balaam said to him, "I have built the seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each." 
04Nm 23:5 The LORD told Balaam what to say and sent him back to Balak to give him his message. 
04Nm 23:6 So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering with all the leaders of Moab. 
04Nm 23:7 Balaam uttered this prophecy£º "Balak king of Moab has brought me From Syria, from the eastern mountains. 'Come speak for me,' he said. 'Put a curse on the people of Israel.' 
04Nm 23:8 How can I curse what God has not cursed, Or speak of doom when the LORD has not? 
04Nm 23:9 From the high rocks I can see them; I can watch them from the hills. They are a nation that lives alone; They know they are blessed more than other nations. 
04Nm 23:10 The descendants of Israel are like the dust - There are too many of them to be counted. Let me end my days like one of God's people; Let me die in peace like the righteous." 
04Nm 23:11 Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but all you have done is bless them." 
04Nm 23:12 He answered, "I can say only what the LORD tells me to say." 
04Nm 23:13 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come with me to another place from which you can see only some of the Israelites. Curse them for me from there." 
04Nm 23:14 He took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Mount Pisgah. There also he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each of them. 
04Nm 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, and I will meet God over there." 
04Nm 23:16 The LORD met Balaam, told him what to say, and sent him back to Balak to give him his message. 
04Nm 23:17 So he went back and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, with the leaders of Moab. Balak asked what the LORD had said, 
04Nm 23:18 and Balaam uttered this prophecy£º "Come, Balak son of Zippor, And listen to what I have to say. 
04Nm 23:19 God is not like people, who lie; He is not a human who changes his mind. Whatever he promises, he does; He speaks, and it is done. 
04Nm 23:20 I have been instructed to bless, And when God blesses, I cannot call it back. 
04Nm 23:21 I foresee that Israel's future Will bring her no misfortune or trouble. The LORD their God is with them; They proclaim that he is their king. 
04Nm 23:22 God has brought them out of Egypt; He fights for them like a wild ox. 
04Nm 23:23 There is no magic charm, no witchcraft, That can be used against the nation of Israel. Now people will say about Israel, 'Look what God has done!' 
04Nm 23:24 The nation of Israel is like a mighty lion£º It doesn't rest until it has torn and devoured, Until it has drunk the blood of those it has killed." 
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "You refuse to curse the people of Israel, but at least don't bless them!" 
04Nm 23:26 Balaam answered, "Didn't I tell you that I had to do everything that the LORD told me?" 
04Nm 23:27 Balak said, "Come with me, and I will take you to another place. Perhaps God will be willing to let you curse them for me from there." 
04Nm 23:28 So he took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor overlooking the desert. 
04Nm 23:29 Balaam said to him, "Build seven altars for me here and bring me seven bulls and seven rams." 
04Nm 23:30 Balak did as he was told, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04Nm 24:1 By now Balaam knew that the LORD wanted him to bless the people of Israel, so he did not go to look for omens, as he had done before. He turned toward the desert 
04Nm 24:2 and saw the people of Israel camped tribe by tribe. The spirit of God took control of him, 
04Nm 24:3 and he uttered this prophecy£º "The message of Balaam son of Beor, The words of the man who can see clearly, 
04Nm 24:4 Who can hear what God is saying. With staring eyes I see in a trance A vision from Almighty God. 
04Nm 24:5 The tents of Israel are beautiful, 
04Nm 24:6 Like long rows of palms Or gardens beside a river, Like aloes planted by the LORD Or cedars beside the water. 
04Nm 24:7 They will have abundant rainfall And plant their seed in well-watered fields. Their king shall be greater than Agag, And his rule shall be extended far and wide. 
04Nm 24:8 God brought them out of Egypt; He fights for them like a wild ox. They devour their enemies, Crush their bones, smash their arrows. 
04Nm 24:9 The nation is like a mighty lion; When it is sleeping, no one dares wake it. Whoever blesses Israel will be blessed, And whoever curses Israel will be cursed." 
04Nm 24:10 Balak clenched his fists in anger and said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, but three times now you have blessed them instead. 
04Nm 24:11 Now get on home! I promised to reward you, but the LORD has kept you from getting the reward." 
04Nm 24:12 Balaam answered, "I told the messengers you sent to me that 
04Nm 24:13 even if you gave me all the silver and gold in your palace, I could not disobey the command of the LORD by doing anything of myself. I will say only what the LORD tells me to say." 
04Nm 24:14 Balaam said to Balak, "Now I am going back to my own people, but before I go, I am warning you what the people of Israel will do to your people in the future." 
04Nm 24:15 Then he uttered this prophecy£º "The message of Balaam son of Beor, The words of the man who can see clearly, 
04Nm 24:16 Who can hear what God is saying And receive the knowledge that comes from the Most High. With staring eyes I see in a trance A vision from Almighty God. 
04Nm 24:17 I look into the future, And I see the nation of Israel. A king, like a bright star, will arise in that nation. Like a comet he will come from Israel. He will strike the leaders of Moab And beat down all the people of Seth. 
04Nm 24:18 He will conquer his enemies in Edom And make their land his property, While Israel continues victorious. 
04Nm 24:19 The nation of Israel will trample them down And wipe out the last survivors." 
04Nm 24:20 Then in his vision Balaam saw the Amalekites and uttered this prophecy£º "Amalek was the most powerful nation of all, But at the end it will perish forever." 
04Nm 24:21 In his vision he saw the Kenites, and uttered this prophecy£º "The place where you live is secure, Safe as a nest set high on a cliff, 
04Nm 24:22 But you Kenites will be destroyed When Assyria takes you captive." 
04Nm 24:23 Balaam uttered this prophecy£º "Who are these people gathering in the north? 
04Nm 24:24 Invaders will sail from Cyprus; They will conquer Assyria and Eber, But they, in turn, will perish forever." 
04Nm 24:25 Then Balaam got ready and went back home, and Balak went on his way. 
04Nm 25:1 When the Israelites were camped at Acacia Valley, the men began to have sexual intercourse with the Moabite women who were there. 
04Nm 25:2 These women invited them to sacrificial feasts, where the god of Moab was worshiped. The Israelites ate the food and worshiped the god 
04Nm 25:3 Baal of Peor. So the LORD was angry with them 
04Nm 25:4 and said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of Israel and, in obedience to me, execute them in broad daylight, and then I will no longer be angry with the people." 
04Nm 25:5 Moses said to the officials, "Each of you is to kill every man in your tribe who has become a worshiper of Baal of Peor." 
04Nm 25:6 One of the Israelites took a Midianite woman into his tent in the sight of Moses and the whole community, while they were mourning at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
04Nm 25:7 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest, saw this, he got up and left the assembly. He took a spear, 
04Nm 25:8 followed the man and the woman into the tent, and drove the spear through both of them. In this way the epidemic that was destroying Israel was stopped, 
04Nm 25:9 but it had already killed twenty-four thousand people. 
04Nm 25:10 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 25:11 "Because of what Phinehas has done, I am no longer angry with the people of Israel. He refused to tolerate the worship of any god but me, and that is why I did not destroy them in my anger. 
04Nm 25:12 So tell him that I am making a covenant with him that is valid for all time to come. 
04Nm 25:13 He and his descendants are permanently established as priests, because he did not tolerate any rivals to me and brought about forgiveness for the people's sin." 
04Nm 25:14 The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the head of a family in the tribe of Simeon. 
04Nm 25:15 The woman's name was Cozbi. Zur, her father, was chief of a group of Midianite clans. 
04Nm 25:16 The LORD commanded Moses, 
04Nm 25:17 "Attack the Midianites and destroy them, 
04Nm 25:18 because of the evil they did to you when they deceived you at Peor, and because of Cozbi, who was killed at the time of the epidemic at Peor." 
04Nm 26:1 After the epidemic the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, 
04Nm 26:2 "Take a census by families of the whole community of Israel, of all men twenty years old or older who are fit for military service." 
04Nm 26:3 Moses and Eleazar obeyed and called together all the men of that age group. They assembled in the plains of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho.
04Nm 26:4 These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt£º 
04Nm 26:5 The tribe of Reuben (Reuben was the oldest son of Jacob)£º the clans of Hanoch, Pallu, 
04Nm 26:6 Hezron, and Carmi. 
04Nm 26:7 These clans numbered 43,730 men. 
04Nm 26:8 The descendants of Pallu were Eliab 
04Nm 26:9 and his sons Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. (These are the Dathan and Abiram who were chosen by the community. They defied Moses and Aaron and joined the followers of Korah when they rebelled against the LORD. 
04Nm 26:10 The ground opened and swallowed them, and they died with Korah and his followers when fire destroyed 250 men; they became a warning to the people. 
04Nm 26:11 But the sons of Korah were not killed.) 
04Nm 26:12 The tribe of Simeon£º the clans of Nemuel, Jamin, Jachin, 
04Nm 26:13 Zerah, and Shaul. 
04Nm 26:14 These clans numbered 22,200 men. 
04Nm 26:15 The tribe of Gad£º the clans of Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, 
04Nm 26:16 Ozni, Eri, 
04Nm 26:17 Arod, and Areli. 
04Nm 26:18 These clans numbered 40,500 men. 
04Nm 26:19 The tribe of Judah£º
04Nm 26:20 the clans of Shelah, Perez, Zerah, Hezron, and Hamul.
04Nm 26:21 (Two of Judah's sons, Er and Onan, had died in the land of Canaan.) 
04Nm 26:22 These clans numbered 76,500 men. 
04Nm 26:23 The tribe of Issachar£º the clans of Tola, Puah, 
04Nm 26:24 Jashub, and Shimron. 
04Nm 26:25 These clans numbered 64,300 men. 
04Nm 26:26 The tribe of Zebulun£º the clans of Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
04Nm 26:27 These clans numbered 60,500 men. 
04Nm 26:28 The tribes of Joseph, who was the father of two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
04Nm 26:29 The tribe of Manasseh. Machir son of Manasseh was the father of Gilead, and the following clans traced their ancestry to Gilead£º 
04Nm 26:30 the clans of Iezer, Helek, 
04Nm 26:31 Asriel, Shechem, 
04Nm 26:32 Shemida, and Hepher. 
04Nm 26:33 Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, but only daughters; their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
04Nm 26:34 These clans numbered 52,700 men. 
04Nm 26:35 The tribe of Ephraim£º the clans of Shuthelah, Becher, and Tahan. 
04Nm 26:36 The clan of Eran traced its descent from Shuthelah. 
04Nm 26:37 These clans numbered 32,500 men. These are the clans descended from Joseph. 
04Nm 26:38 The tribe of Benjamin£º the clans of Bela, Ashbel, Ahiram, 
04Nm 26:39 Shephupham, and Hupham. 
04Nm 26:40 The clans of Ard and Naaman traced their descent from Bela. 
04Nm 26:41 These clans numbered 45,600 men. 
04Nm 26:42 The tribe of Dan£º the clan of Shuham, 
04Nm 26:43 which numbered 64,400 men. 
04Nm 26:44 The tribe of Asher£º the clans of Imnah, Ishvi, and Beriah. 
04Nm 26:45 The clans of Heber and Malchiel traced their descent from Beriah. 
04Nm 26:46 Asher had a daughter named Serah. 
04Nm 26:47 These clans numbered 53,400 men. 
04Nm 26:48 The tribe of Naphtali£º the clans of Jahzeel, Guni, 
04Nm 26:49 Jezer, and Shillem. 
04Nm 26:50 These clans numbered 45,400 men. 
04Nm 26:51 The total number of the Israelite men was 601,730. 
04Nm 26:52 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 26:53 "Divide the land among the tribes, according to their size. 
04Nm 26:54 Divide the land by drawing lots,
04Nm 26:55 and give a large share to a large tribe
04Nm 26:56 and a small one to a small tribe." 
04Nm 26:57 The tribe of Levi consisted of the clans of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
04Nm 26:58 Their descendants included the subclans of Libni, Hebron, Mahli, Mushi, and Korah. Kohath was the father of Amram, 
04Nm 26:59 who was married to Levi's daughter Jochebed, who was born in Egypt. She bore Amram two sons, Aaron and Moses, and a daughter, Miriam. 
04Nm 26:60 Aaron had four sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
04Nm 26:61 Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unholy fire to the LORD. 
04Nm 26:62 The male Levites who were one month old or older numbered 23,000. They were listed separately from the rest of the Israelites, because they were not given any property in Israel. 
04Nm 26:63 All these clans were listed by Moses and Eleazar when they took a census of the Israelites in the plains of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho. 
04Nm 26:64 There was not even one man left among those whom Moses and Aaron had listed in the first census in the Sinai Desert. 
04Nm 26:65 The LORD had said that all of them would die in the wilderness, and except for Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun they all did. 
04Nm 27:1 Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah were the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph. 
04Nm 27:2 They went and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole community at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence and said, 
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness without leaving any sons. He was not among the followers of Korah, who rebelled against the LORD; he died because of his own sin. 
04Nm 27:4 Just because he had no sons, why should our father's name disappear from Israel? Give us property among our father's relatives." 
04Nm 27:5 Moses presented their case to the LORD, 
04Nm 27:6 and the LORD said to him, 
04Nm 27:7 "What the daughters of Zelophehad request is right; give them property among their father's relatives. Let his inheritance pass on to them. 
04Nm 27:8 Tell the people of Israel that whenever a man dies without leaving a son, his daughter is to inherit his property. 
04Nm 27:9 If he has no daughter, his brothers are to inherit it. 
04Nm 27:10 If he has no brothers, his father's brothers are to inherit it. 
04Nm 27:11 If he has no brothers or uncles, then his nearest relative is to inherit it and hold it as his own property. The people of Israel are to observe this as a legal requirement, just as I, the LORD, have commanded you." 
04Nm 27:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Go up the Abarim Mountains and look out over the land that I am giving to the Israelites. 
04Nm 27:13 After you have seen it, you will die, as your brother Aaron did, 
04Nm 27:14 because both of you rebelled against my command in the wilderness of Zin. When the whole community complained against me at Meribah, you refused to acknowledge my holy power before them." (Meribah is the spring at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) 
04Nm 27:15 Moses prayed, 
04Nm 27:16 " LORD God, source of all life, appoint, I pray, a man who can lead the people 
04Nm 27:17 and can command them in battle, so that your community will not be like sheep without a shepherd." 
04Nm 27:18 The LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a capable man, and place your hands on his head. 
04Nm 27:19 Have him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole community, and there before them all proclaim him as your successor. 
04Nm 27:20 Give him some of your own authority, so that the whole community of Israel will obey him. 
04Nm 27:21 He will depend on Eleazar the priest, who will learn my will by using the Urim and Thummim. In this way Eleazar will direct Joshua and the whole community of Israel in all their affairs." 
04Nm 27:22 Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. He had Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole community. 
04Nm 27:23 As the LORD had commanded, Moses put his hands on Joshua's head and proclaimed him as his successor. 
04Nm 28:1 The LORD commanded Moses 
04Nm 28:2 to instruct the Israelites to present to God at the appointed times the required food offerings that are pleasing to him. 
04Nm 28:3 These are the food offerings that are to be presented to the LORD£º for the daily burnt offering, two one-year-old male lambs without any defects.

04Nm 29:39 These are the regulations concerning the burnt offerings, grain offerings, wine offerings, and fellowship offerings that you are to make to the LORD at your appointed festivals. These are in addition to the offerings you give in fulfillment of a vow or as freewill offerings. 
04Nm 29:40 So Moses told the people of Israel everything that the LORD had commanded him. 
04Nm 30:1 Moses gave the following instructions to the leaders of the tribes of Israel. 
04Nm 30:2 When a man makes a vow to give something to the LORD or takes an oath to abstain from something, he must not break his promise, but must do everything that he said he would. 
04Nm 30:3 When a young woman still living in her father's house makes a vow to give something to the LORD or promises to abstain from something, 
04Nm 30:4 she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her father raises an objection when he hears about it. 
04Nm 30:5 But if her father forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The LORD will forgive her, because her father refused to let her keep it. 
04Nm 30:6 If an unmarried woman makes a vow, whether deliberately or carelessly, or promises to abstain from something, and then marries, 
04Nm 30:7 she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it. 
04Nm 30:8 But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The LORD will forgive her. 
04Nm 30:9 A widow or a divorced woman must keep every vow she makes and every promise to abstain from something. 
04Nm 30:10 If a married woman makes a vow or promises to abstain from something, 
04Nm 30:11 she must do everything that she vowed or promised unless her husband raises an objection when he hears about it. 
04Nm 30:12 But if her husband forbids her to fulfill the vow when he hears about it, she is not required to keep it. The LORD will forgive her, because her husband prevented her from keeping her vow. 
04Nm 30:13 Her husband has the right to affirm or to annul any vow or promise that she has made. 
04Nm 30:14 But if, by the day after he hears of the vow, he has raised no objection, she must do everything that she has vowed or promised. He has affirmed the vow by not objecting on the day he heard of it. 
04Nm 30:15 But if he later annuls the vow, he must suffer the consequences for the failure to fulfill the vow. 
04Nm 30:16 These are the rules that the LORD gave Moses concerning vows made by an unmarried woman living in her father's house or by a married woman. 
04Nm 31:1 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 31:2 "Punish the Midianites for what they did to the people of Israel. After you have done that, you will die." 
04Nm 31:3 So Moses said to the people, "Get ready for war, so that you can attack Midian and punish them for what they did to the LORD. 
04Nm 31:4 From each tribe of Israel send a thousand men to war." 
04Nm 31:5 So a thousand men were chosen from each tribe, a total of twelve thousand men ready for battle. 
04Nm 31:6 Moses sent them to war under the command of Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took charge of the sacred objects and the trumpets for giving signals. 
04Nm 31:7 They attacked Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and killed all the men, 
04Nm 31:8 including the five kings of Midian£º Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor. 
04Nm 31:9 The people of Israel captured the Midianite women and children, took their cattle and their flocks, plundered all their wealth, 
04Nm 31:10 and burned all their cities and camps. 
04Nm 31:11 They took all the loot that they had captured, including the prisoners and the animals, 
04Nm 31:12 and brought them to Moses and Eleazar and to the community of the people of Israel, who were at the camp on the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. 
04Nm 31:13 Moses, Eleazar, and all the other leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet the army. 
04Nm 31:14 Moses became angry with the officers, the commanders of battalions and companies, who had returned from the war. 
04Nm 31:15 He asked them, "Why have you kept all the women alive? 
04Nm 31:16 Remember that it was the women who followed Balaam's instructions and at Peor led the people to be unfaithful to the LORD. That was what brought the epidemic on the LORD's people. 
04Nm 31:17 So now kill every boy and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse, 
04Nm 31:18 but keep alive for yourselves all the girls and all the women who are virgins. 
04Nm 31:19 Now all of you who have killed anyone or have touched a corpse must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day purify yourselves and the women you have captured. 
04Nm 31:20 You must also purify every piece of clothing and everything made of leather, goats' hair, or wood." 
04Nm 31:21 Eleazar the priest said to the men who had returned from battle, "These are the regulations that the LORD has given to Moses. 
04Nm 31:22 Everything that will not burn, such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead, is to be purified by passing it through fire.
04Nm 31:23 Everything else is to be purified by the water for purification. 
04Nm 31:24 On the seventh day you must wash your clothes; then you will be ritually clean and will be permitted to enter the camp." 
04Nm 31:25 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 31:26 "You and Eleazar, together with the other leaders of the community, are to count everything that has been captured, including the prisoners and the animals. 
04Nm 31:27 Divide what was taken into two equal parts, one part for the soldiers and the other part for the rest of the community. 
04Nm 31:28 From the part that belongs to the soldiers, withhold as a tax for the LORD one out of every five hundred prisoners and the same proportion of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats. 
04Nm 31:29 Give them to Eleazar the priest as a special contribution to the LORD. 
04Nm 31:30 From the part given to the rest of the people, take one out of every fifty prisoners and the same proportion of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats. Give them to the Levites who are in charge of the LORD's Tent." 
04Nm 31:31 Moses and Eleazar did what the LORD commanded. 
04Nm 31:32 The following is a list of what was captured by the soldiers, in addition to what they kept for themselves£º
04Nm 31:33 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:34 61,000 donkeys,
04Nm 31:35 and 32,000 virgins. 
04Nm 31:36 The half share of the soldiers was 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:37 of which 675 were the tax for the LORD; 36,000 cattle for the soldiers,
04Nm 31:38 of which 72 were the tax for the LORD; 30,500 donkeys for the soldiers,
04Nm 31:39 of which 61 were the tax for the LORD; and 16,000 virgins for the soldiers,
04Nm 31:40 of which 32 were the tax for the LORD. 
04Nm 31:41 So Moses gave Eleazar the tax as a special contribution to the LORD, as the LORD had commanded. 
04Nm 31:42 The share of the community was the same as that for the soldiers£º
04Nm 31:43 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:44 36,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:45 30,500 donkeys,
04Nm 31:46 and 16,000 virgins. 
04Nm 31:47 From this share Moses took one out of every fifty prisoners and animals, and as the LORD had commanded, gave them to the Levites who were in charge of the LORD's Tent. 
04Nm 31:48 Then the officers who had commanded the army went to Moses 
04Nm 31:49 and reported, "Sir, we have counted the soldiers under our command and not one of them is missing. 
04Nm 31:50 So we are bringing the gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces that each of us has taken. We offer them to the LORD as a payment for our lives, so that he will protect us." 
04Nm 31:51 Moses and Eleazar received the gold, all of which was in the form of ornaments. 
04Nm 31:52 The total contribution of the officers weighed over four hundred pounds. 
04Nm 31:53 Those who were not officers kept the loot they had taken. 
04Nm 31:54 So Moses and Eleazar took the gold to the Tent, so that the LORD would protect the people of Israel. 
04Nm 32:1 The tribes of Reuben and Gad had a lot of livestock. When they saw how suitable the land of Jazer and Gilead was for cattle, 
04Nm 32:2 they went to Moses, Eleazar, and the other leaders of the community and said, 
04Nm 32:3 "This region which the LORD has helped the Israelites occupy - 
04Nm 32:4 the towns of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah, Nebo, and Beon - is good land for livestock, and we have so much livestock. 
04Nm 32:5 Please give us this land as our property, and do not make us cross the Jordan River and settle there." 
04Nm 32:6 Moses replied, "Do you want to stay here while the other Israelites go to war? 
04Nm 32:7 How dare you try to discourage the people of Israel from crossing the Jordan into the land which the LORD has given them? 
04Nm 32:8 That is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. 
04Nm 32:9 They went as far as Eshcol Valley and saw the land, but when they returned, they discouraged the people from entering the land which the LORD had given them. 
04Nm 32:10 The LORD became angry that day and made a promise£º 
04Nm 32:11 'I swear that because they did not remain loyal to me, none of the men twenty years old or older who came out of Egypt will enter the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' 
04Nm 32:12 This included everyone, except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun; they remained loyal to the LORD. 
04Nm 32:13 The LORD became angry with the people and made them wander in the wilderness forty years until that whole generation that had displeased him was dead. 
04Nm 32:14 And now you have taken your ancestors' place, a new generation of sinful people ready to bring down the fierce anger of the LORD on Israel again. 
04Nm 32:15 If you people of Reuben and Gad refuse to follow him now, he will once again abandon all these people in the wilderness, and you will be responsible for their destruction." 
04Nm 32:16 They approached Moses and said, "First, allow us to build stone enclosures here for our sheep and fortified towns for our dependents. 
04Nm 32:17 Then we will be ready to go with the other Israelites into battle and lead the attack until we have settled them in the land that will be theirs. In the meantime, our dependents can live here in the fortified towns, safe from the people of this land. 
04Nm 32:18 We will not return to our homes until all the other Israelites have taken possession of the land assigned to them. 
04Nm 32:19 We will not take possession of any property among them on the other side of the Jordan, because we have received our share here east of the Jordan." 
04Nm 32:20 Moses answered, "If you really mean what you say, then here in the presence of the LORD get ready to go into battle. 
04Nm 32:21 All your fighting men are to cross the Jordan and under the command of the LORD they are to attack our enemies until the LORD defeats them 
04Nm 32:22 and takes possession of the land. After that, you may return, because you will have fulfilled your obligation to the LORD and to the other Israelites. Then the LORD will acknowledge that this land east of the Jordan is yours. 
04Nm 32:23 But if you do not keep your promise, I warn you that you will be sinning against the LORD. Make no mistake about it; you will be punished for your sin. 
04Nm 32:24 So build your towns and the enclosures for your sheep, but do what you have promised!" 
04Nm 32:25 The men of Gad and Reuben said, "Sir, we will do as you command. 
04Nm 32:26 Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep will remain here in the towns of Gilead. 
04Nm 32:27 But all of us are ready to go into battle under the LORD's command. We will cross the Jordan and fight, just as you have said." 
04Nm 32:28 So Moses gave these commands to Eleazar, Joshua, and the other leaders of Israel£º 
04Nm 32:29 "If the men of Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan ready for battle at the LORD's command and if with their help you are able to conquer the land, then give them the land of Gilead as their property. 
04Nm 32:30 But if they do not cross the Jordan and go into battle with you, they are to receive their share of the property in the land of Canaan, as you do." 
04Nm 32:31 The men of Gad and Reuben answered, "Sir, we will do as the LORD has commanded. 
04Nm 32:32 Under his command we will cross into the land of Canaan and go into battle, so that we can retain our property here east of the Jordan." 
04Nm 32:33 So Moses assigned to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half the tribe of Manasseh all the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan, including the towns and the country around them. 
04Nm 32:34 The tribe of Gad rebuilt the fortified towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
04Nm 32:35 Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
04Nm 32:36 Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran. 
04Nm 32:37 The tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
04Nm 32:38 Nebo, Baal Meon (this name was changed), and Sibmah. They gave new names to the towns they rebuilt. 
04Nm 32:39 The clan of Machir son of Manasseh invaded the land of Gilead, occupied it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
04Nm 32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir, and they lived there. 
04Nm 32:41 Jair, of the tribe of Manasseh, attacked and captured some villages and named them "Villages of Jair." 
04Nm 32:42 Nobah attacked and captured Kenath and its villages, and he renamed it Nobah, after himself. 
04Nm 33:1 The following account gives the names of the places where the Israelites set up camp after they left Egypt in their tribes under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 
04Nm 33:2 At the command of the LORD, Moses wrote down the name of the place each time they set up camp. 
04Nm 33:3 The people of Israel left Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after the first Passover. Under the LORD's protection they left the city of Rameses in full view of the Egyptians, 
04Nm 33:4 who were burying the first-born sons that the LORD had killed. By doing this, the LORD showed that he was more powerful than the gods of Egypt. 
04Nm 33:5 The people of Israel left Rameses and set up camp at Sukkoth. 
04Nm 33:6 Their next camp was at Etham on the edge of the desert. 
04Nm 33:7 From there they turned back to Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol. 
04Nm 33:8 They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the Red Sea into the desert of Shur; after a three days' march they camped at Marah. 
04Nm 33:9 From there they went to Elim, where they camped, because there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees there. 
04Nm 33:10 They left Elim and camped near the Gulf of Suez. 
04Nm 33:11 Their next camp was in the desert of Sin. 
04Nm 33:12 Then they camped at Dophkah, 
04Nm 33:13 and after that at Alush. 
04Nm 33:14 Next was Rephidim, where there was no water for them to drink. 
04Nm 33:15 From Rephidim to Mount Hor they set up camp at the following places£º
04Nm 33:16 the Sinai Desert,
04Nm 33:17 Kibroth Hattaavah (or "Graves of Craving"),
04Nm 33:18 Hazeroth, Rithmah,
04Nm 33:19 Rimmon Perez, Libnah,
04Nm 33:20 Rissah, Kehelathah,
04Nm 33:21 Mount Shepher,
04Nm 33:22 Haradah,
04Nm 33:23 Makheloth, 
04Nm 33:24 Tahath,
04Nm 33:25 Terah,
04Nm 33:26 Mithkah,
04Nm 33:27 Hashmonah,
04Nm 33:28 Moseroth,
04Nm 33:29 Bene Jaakan,
04Nm 33:30 Hor Haggidgad,
04Nm 33:31 Jotbathah,
04Nm 33:32 Abronah,
04Nm 33:33 Eziongeber,
04Nm 33:34 the wilderness of Zin 
04Nm 33:35 (that is, Kadesh),
04Nm 33:36 and Mount Hor,
04Nm 33:37 at the edge of the land of Edom. 
04Nm 33:38 At the command of the LORD, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor. 
04Nm 33:39 At the age of 123 he died there on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites had left Egypt. 
04Nm 33:40 The king of Arad in southern Canaan heard that the Israelites were coming. 
04Nm 33:41 From Mount Hor to the plains of Moab the Israelites set up camp at the following places£º
04Nm 33:42 Zalmonah,
04Nm 33:43 Punon,
04Nm 33:44 Oboth, 
04Nm 33:45 the ruins of Abarim in the territory of Moab, Dibon Gad,
04Nm 33:46 Almon Diblathaim, 
04Nm 33:47 the Abarim Mountains near Mount Nebo,
04Nm 33:48 and in the plains of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho, 
04Nm 33:49 between Beth Jeshimoth and Acacia Valley. 
04Nm 33:50 There in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho the LORD gave Moses 
04Nm 33:51 the following instructions for Israel£º "When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
04Nm 33:52 you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land. Destroy all their stone and metal idols and all their places of worship. 
04Nm 33:53 Occupy the land and settle in it, because I am giving it to you. 
04Nm 33:54 Divide the land among the various tribes and clans by drawing lots, giving a large piece of property to a large clan and a small one to a small clan. 
04Nm 33:55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those that are left will be as troublesome as splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will fight against you. 
04Nm 33:56 If you do not drive them out, I will destroy you, as I planned to destroy them." 
04Nm 34:1 The LORD gave Moses 
04Nm 34:2 the following instructions for the people of Israel£º "When you enter Canaan, the land which I am giving you, the borders of your territory will be as follows. 
04Nm 34:3 The southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. It will begin on the east at the southern end of the Dead Sea. 
04Nm 34:4 Then it will turn southward toward Akrabbim Pass and continue on through Zin as far south as Kadesh Barnea. Then it will turn northwest to Hazar Addar and on to Azmon, 
04Nm 34:5 where it will turn toward the valley at the border of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean. 
04Nm 34:6 "The western border will be the Mediterranean Sea. 
04Nm 34:7 "The northern border will follow a line from the Mediterranean to Mount Hor 
04Nm 34:8 and from there to Hamath Pass. It will continue to Zedad 
04Nm 34:9 and to Ziphron, and will end at Hazar Enan. 
04Nm 34:10 "The eastern border will follow a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham. 
04Nm 34:11 It will then go south to Harbel, east of Ain, and on to the hills on the eastern shore of Lake Galilee, 
04Nm 34:12 then south along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea. "These will be the four borders of your land." 
04Nm 34:13 So Moses said to the Israelites, "This is the land that you will receive by drawing lots, the land that the LORD has assigned to the nine and one-half tribes. 
04Nm 34:14 The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half of Manasseh have received their property, divided according to their families, 
04Nm 34:15 on the eastern side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho." 
04Nm 34:16 The LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 34:17 "Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun will divide the land for the people. 
04Nm 34:18 Take also one leader from each tribe to help them divide it." 
04Nm 34:19 These are the men the LORD chose£º [Tribe£º Leader] Judah£º Caleb son of Jephunneh,
04Nm 34:20 Simeon£º Shelumiel son of Ammihud,
04Nm 34:21 Benjamin£º Elidad son of Chislon,
04Nm 34:22 Dan£º Bukki son of Jogli,
04Nm 34:23 Manasseh£º Hanniel son of Ephod,
04Nm 34:24 Ephraim£º Kemuel son of Shiphtan,
04Nm 34:25 Zebulun£º Elizaphan son of Parnach,
04Nm 34:26 Issachar£º Paltiel son of Azzan,
04Nm 34:27 Asher£º Ahihud son of Shelomi,
04Nm 34:28 Naphtali£º Pedahel son of Ammihud.
04Nm 34:29 These are the men that the LORD assigned to divide the property for the people of Israel in the land of Canaan. 
04Nm 35:1 In the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho the LORD said to Moses, 
04Nm 35:2 "Tell the Israelites that from the property they receive they must give the Levites some cities to live in and pasture land around the cities. 
04Nm 35:3 These cities will belong to the Levites, and they will live there. The pasture land will be for their cattle and all their other animals. 
04Nm 35:4 The pasture land is to extend outward from the city walls five hundred yards in each direction, 
04Nm 35:5 so that there is a square area measuring one thousand yards on each side, with the city in the middle. 
04Nm 35:6 You are to give the Levites six cities of refuge to which any of you can escape if you kill someone accidentally. In addition, give them forty-two other cities 
04Nm 35:7 with their pasture land, making a total of forty-eight. 
04Nm 35:8 The number of Levite cities in each tribe is to be determined according to the size of its territory." 
04Nm 35:9 The LORD told Moses 
04Nm 35:10 to say to the people of Israel£º "When you cross the Jordan River and enter the land of Canaan, 
04Nm 35:11 you are to choose cities of refuge to which any of you can escape if you kill someone accidentally. 
04Nm 35:12 There you will be safe from the dead person's relative who seeks revenge. No one accused of manslaughter is to be put to death without a public trial. 
04Nm 35:13 Choose six cities, 
04Nm 35:14 three east of the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan. 
04Nm 35:15 These will serve as cities of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners who are temporary or permanent residents. Anyone who kills someone accidentally can escape to one of them. 
04Nm 35:16 "If, however, any of you use a weapon of iron or stone or wood to kill someone,
04Nm 35:17 you are guilty of murder
04Nm 35:18 and are to be put to death. 
04Nm 35:19 The dead person's nearest relative has the responsibility for putting the murderer to death. When he finds you, he is to kill you. 
04Nm 35:20 "If you hate someone and kill him by pushing him down or by throwing something at him 
04Nm 35:21 or by striking him with your fist, you are guilty of murder and are to be put to death. The dead person's nearest relative has the responsibility for putting the murderer to death. When he finds you, he is to kill you. 
04Nm 35:22 "But suppose you accidentally kill someone you do not hate, whether by pushing him down or by throwing something at him. 
04Nm 35:23 Or suppose that, without looking, you throw a stone that kills someone whom you did not intend to hurt and who was not your enemy. 
04Nm 35:24 In such cases the community shall judge in your favor and not in favor of the dead person's relative who is seeking revenge. 
04Nm 35:25 You are guilty only of manslaughter, and the community is to rescue you from the dead person's relative, and they are to return you to the city of refuge to which you had escaped. You must live there until the death of the man who is then High Priest. 
04Nm 35:26 If you leave the city of refuge to which you have escaped 
04Nm 35:27 and if the dead person's relative finds you and kills you, this act of revenge is not murder. 
04Nm 35:28 Any of you guilty of manslaughter must remain in the city of refuge until the death of the High Priest, but after that you may return home. 
04Nm 35:29 These rules apply to you and your descendants wherever you may live. 
04Nm 35:30 "Those accused of murder may be found guilty and put to death only on the evidence of two or more witnesses; the evidence of one witness is not sufficient to support an accusation of murder. 
04Nm 35:31 Murderers must be put to death. They cannot escape this penalty by the payment of money. 
04Nm 35:32 If they have fled to a city of refuge, do not allow them to make a payment in order to return home before the death of the High Priest. 
04Nm 35:33 If you did this, you would defile the land where you are living. Murder defiles the land, and except by the death of the murderer there is no way to perform the ritual of purification for the land where someone has been murdered. 
04Nm 35:34 Do not defile the land where you are living, because I am the LORD and I live among the people of Israel." 
04Nm 36:1 The heads of the families in the clan of Gilead, the son of Machir and grandson of Manasseh son of Joseph, went to Moses and the other leaders. 
04Nm 36:2 They said, "The LORD commanded you to distribute the land to the people of Israel by drawing lots. He also commanded you to give the property of our relative Zelophehad to his daughters. 
04Nm 36:3 But remember, if they marry men of another tribe, their property will then belong to that tribe, and the total allotted to us will be reduced. 
04Nm 36:4 In the Year of Restoration, when all property that has been sold is restored to its original owners, the property of Zelophehad's daughters will be permanently added to the tribe into which they marry and will be lost to our tribe." 
04Nm 36:5 So Moses gave the people of Israel the following command from the LORD. He said, "What the tribe of Manasseh says is right, 
04Nm 36:6 and so the LORD says that the daughters of Zelophehad are free to marry anyone they wish but only within their own tribe. 
04Nm 36:7 The property of every Israelite will remain attached to his tribe. 
04Nm 36:8 Every woman who inherits property in an Israelite tribe must marry a man belonging to that tribe. In this way all Israelites will inherit the property of their ancestors, 
04Nm 36:9 and the property will not pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe will continue to possess its own property." 
04Nm 36:10 So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, did as the LORD had commanded Moses,
04Nm 36:11 and they married their cousins. 
04Nm 36:12 They married within the clans of the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their property remained in their father's tribe. 
04Nm 36:13 These are the rules and regulations that the LORD gave the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab across the Jordan River from Jericho.
