44Ac 1:1 Dear Theophilus£º In my first book I wrote about all the things that Jesus did and taught from the time he began his work 
44Ac 1:2 until the day he was taken up to heaven. Before he was taken up, he gave instructions by the power of the Holy Spirit to the men he had chosen as his apostles. 
44Ac 1:3 For forty days after his death he appeared to them many times in ways that proved beyond doubt that he was alive. They saw him, and he talked with them about the Kingdom of God. 
44Ac 1:4 And when they came together, he gave them this order£º "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift I told you about, the gift my Father promised. 
44Ac 1:5 John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." 
44Ac 1:6 When the apostles met together with Jesus, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time give the Kingdom back to Israel?" 
44Ac 1:7 Jesus said to them, "The times and occasions are set by my Father's own authority, and it is not for you to know when they will be. 
44Ac 1:8 But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will be filled with power, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." 
44Ac 1:9 After saying this, he was taken up to heaven as they watched him, and a cloud hid him from their sight. 
44Ac 1:10 They still had their eyes fixed on the sky as he went away, when two men dressed in white suddenly stood beside them 
44Ac 1:11 and said, "Galileans, why are you standing there looking up at the sky? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you saw him go to heaven." 
44Ac 1:12 Then the apostles went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is about half a mile away from the city. 
44Ac 1:13 They entered the city and went up to the room where they were staying£º Peter, John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Patriot, and Judas son of James. 
44Ac 1:14 They gathered frequently to pray as a group, together with the women and with Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. 
44Ac 1:15 A few days later there was a meeting of the believers, about a hundred and twenty in all, and Peter stood up to speak. 
44Ac 1:16 "My friends," he said, "the scripture had to come true in which the Holy Spirit, speaking through David, made a prediction about Judas, who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus. 
44Ac 1:17 Judas was a member of our group, for he had been chosen to have a part in our work." 
44Ac 1:18 (With the money that Judas got for his evil act he bought a field, where he fell to his death; he burst open and all his insides spilled out. 
44Ac 1:19 All the people living in Jerusalem heard about it, and so in their own language they call that field Akeldama, which means "Field of Blood.") 
44Ac 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'May his house become empty; may no one live in it.' It is also written, 'May someone else take his place of service.' 
44Ac 1:21 "So then, someone must join us as a witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 1:22 He must be one of the men who were in our group during the whole time that the Lord Jesus traveled about with us, beginning from the time John preached his message of baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us to heaven." 
44Ac 1:23 So they proposed two men£º Joseph, who was called Barsabbas (also known as Justus), and Matthias. 
44Ac 1:24 Then they prayed, "Lord, you know the thoughts of everyone, so show us which of these two you have chosen 
44Ac 1:25 to serve as an apostle in the place of Judas, who left to go to the place where he belongs." 
44Ac 1:26 Then they drew lots to choose between the two men, and the one chosen was Matthias, who was added to the group of eleven apostles. 
44Ac 2:1 When the day of Pentecost came, all the believers were gathered together in one place. 
44Ac 2:2 Suddenly there was a noise from the sky which sounded like a strong wind blowing, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
44Ac 2:3 Then they saw what looked like tongues of fire which spread out and touched each person there. 
44Ac 2:4 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to talk in other languages, as the Spirit enabled them to speak. 
44Ac 2:5 There were Jews living in Jerusalem, religious people who had come from every country in the world. 
44Ac 2:6 When they heard this noise, a large crowd gathered. They were all excited, because all of them heard the believers talking in their own languages. 
44Ac 2:7 In amazement and wonder they exclaimed, "These people who are talking like this are Galileans! 
44Ac 2:8 How is it, then, that all of us hear them speaking in our own native languages? 
44Ac 2:9 We are from Parthia, Media, and Elam; from Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia; from Pontus and Asia, 
44Ac 2:10 from Phrygia and Pamphylia, from Egypt and the regions of Libya near Cyrene. Some of us are from Rome, 
44Ac 2:11 both Jews and Gentiles converted to Judaism, and some of us are from Crete and Arabia - yet all of us hear them speaking in our own languages about the great things that God has done!" 
44Ac 2:12 Amazed and confused, they kept asking each other, "What does this mean?" 
44Ac 2:13 But others made fun of the believers, saying, "These people are drunk!" 
44Ac 2:14 Then Peter stood up with the other eleven apostles and in a loud voice began to speak to the crowd£º "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, listen to me and let me tell you what this means. 
44Ac 2:15 These people are not drunk, as you suppose; it is only nine o'clock in the morning. 
44Ac 2:16 Instead, this is what the prophet Joel spoke about£º 
44Ac 2:17 'This is what I will do in the last days, God says£º I will pour out my Spirit on everyone. Your sons and daughters will proclaim my message; your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams. 
44Ac 2:18 Yes, even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will proclaim my message. 
44Ac 2:19 I will perform miracles in the sky above and wonders on the earth below. There will be blood, fire, and thick smoke; 
44Ac 2:20 the sun will be darkened, and the moon will turn red as blood, before the great and glorious Day of the Lord comes. 
44Ac 2:21 And then, whoever calls out to the Lord for help will be saved.' 
44Ac 2:22 "Listen to these words, fellow Israelites! Jesus of Nazareth was a man whose divine authority was clearly proven to you by all the miracles and wonders which God performed through him. You yourselves know this, for it happened here among you. 
44Ac 2:23 In accordance with his own plan God had already decided that Jesus would be handed over to you; and you killed him by letting sinful men crucify him. 
44Ac 2:24 But God raised him from death, setting him free from its power, because it was impossible that death should hold him prisoner. 
44Ac 2:25 For David said about him, 'I saw the Lord before me at all times; he is near me, and I will not be troubled. 
44Ac 2:26 And so I am filled with gladness, and my words are full of joy. And I, mortal though I am, will rest assured in hope, 
44Ac 2:27 because you will not abandon me in the world of the dead; you will not allow your faithful servant to rot in the grave. 
44Ac 2:28 You have shown me the paths that lead to life, and your presence will fill me with joy.' 
44Ac 2:29 "My friends, I must speak to you plainly about our famous ancestor King David. He died and was buried, and his grave is here with us to this very day. 
44Ac 2:30 He was a prophet, and he knew what God had promised him£º God had made a vow that he would make one of David's descendants a king, just as David was. 
44Ac 2:31 David saw what God was going to do in the future, and so he spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah when he said, 'He was not abandoned in the world of the dead; his body did not rot in the grave.' 
44Ac 2:32 God has raised this very Jesus from death, and we are all witnesses to this fact. 
44Ac 2:33 He has been raised to the right side of God, his Father, and has received from him the Holy Spirit, as he had promised. What you now see and hear is his gift that he has poured out on us. 
44Ac 2:34 For it was not David who went up into heaven; rather he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord£º Sit here at my right side 
44Ac 2:35 until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.' 
44Ac 2:36 "All the people of Israel, then, are to know for sure that this Jesus, whom you crucified, is the one that God has made Lord and Messiah!" 
44Ac 2:37 When the people heard this, they were deeply troubled and said to Peter and the other apostles, "What shall we do, brothers?" 
44Ac 2:38 Peter said to them, "Each one of you must turn away from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, so that your sins will be forgiven; and you will receive God's gift, the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 2:39 For God's promise was made to you and your children, and to all who are far away - all whom the Lord our God calls to himself." 
44Ac 2:40 Peter made his appeal to them and with many other words he urged them, saying, "Save yourselves from the punishment coming on this wicked people!" 
44Ac 2:41 Many of them believed his message and were baptized, and about three thousand people were added to the group that day. 
44Ac 2:42 They spent their time in learning from the apostles, taking part in the fellowship, and sharing in the fellowship meals and the prayers. 
44Ac 2:43 Many miracles and wonders were being done through the apostles, and everyone was filled with awe. 
44Ac 2:44 All the believers continued together in close fellowship and shared their belongings with one another. 
44Ac 2:45 They would sell their property and possessions, and distribute the money among all, according to what each one needed. 
44Ac 2:46 Day after day they met as a group in the Temple, and they had their meals together in their homes, eating with glad and humble hearts, 
44Ac 2:47 praising God, and enjoying the good will of all the people. And every day the Lord added to their group those who were being saved. 
44Ac 3:1 One day Peter and John went to the Temple at three o'clock in the afternoon, the hour for prayer. 
44Ac 3:2 There at the Beautiful Gate, as it was called, was a man who had been lame all his life. Every day he was carried to the gate to beg for money from the people who were going into the Temple. 
44Ac 3:3 When he saw Peter and John going in, he begged them to give him something. 
44Ac 3:4 They looked straight at him, and Peter said, "Look at us!" 
44Ac 3:5 So he looked at them, expecting to get something from them. 
44Ac 3:6 But Peter said to him, "I have no money at all, but I give you what I have£º in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I order you to get up and walk!" 
44Ac 3:7 Then he took him by his right hand and helped him up. At once the man's feet and ankles became strong; 
44Ac 3:8 he jumped up, stood on his feet, and started walking around. Then he went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and praising God. 
44Ac 3:9 The people there saw him walking and praising God, 
44Ac 3:10 and when they recognized him as the beggar who had sat at the Beautiful Gate, they were all surprised and amazed at what had happened to him. 
44Ac 3:11 As the man held on to Peter and John in Solomon's Porch, as it was called, the people were amazed and ran to them. 
44Ac 3:12 When Peter saw the people, he said to them, "Fellow Israelites, why are you surprised at this, and why do you stare at us? Do you think that it was by means of our own power or godliness that we made this man walk? 
44Ac 3:13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has given divine glory to his Servant Jesus. But you handed him over to the authorities, and you rejected him in Pilate's presence, even after Pilate had decided to set him free. 
44Ac 3:14 He was holy and good, but you rejected him, and instead you asked Pilate to do you the favor of turning loose a murderer. 
44Ac 3:15 You killed the one who leads to life, but God raised him from death - and we are witnesses to this. 
44Ac 3:16 It was the power of his name that gave strength to this lame man. What you see and know was done by faith in his name; it was faith in Jesus that has made him well, as you can all see. 
44Ac 3:17 "And now, my friends, I know that what you and your leaders did to Jesus was due to your ignorance. 
44Ac 3:18 God announced long ago through all the prophets that his Messiah had to suffer; and he made it come true in this way. 
44Ac 3:19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that he will forgive your sins. If you do, 
44Ac 3:20 times of spiritual strength will come from the Lord, and he will send Jesus, who is the Messiah he has already chosen for you. 
44Ac 3:21 He must remain in heaven until the time comes for all things to be made new, as God announced through his holy prophets of long ago. 
44Ac 3:22 For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will send you a prophet, just as he sent me, and he will be one of your own people. You are to obey everything that he tells you to do. 
44Ac 3:23 Anyone who does not obey that prophet shall be separated from God's people and destroyed.' 
44Ac 3:24 And all the prophets who had a message, including Samuel and those who came after him, also announced what has been happening these days. 
44Ac 3:25 The promises of God through his prophets are for you, and you share in the covenant which God made with your ancestors. As he said to Abraham, 'Through your descendants I will bless all the people on earth.' 
44Ac 3:26 And so God chose his Servant and sent him to you first, to bless you by making every one of you turn away from your wicked ways." 
44Ac 4:1 Peter and John were still speaking to the people when some priests, the officer in charge of the Temple guards, and some Sadducees arrived. 
44Ac 4:2 They were annoyed because the two apostles were teaching the people that Jesus had risen from death, which proved that the dead will rise to life. 
44Ac 4:3 So they arrested them and put them in jail until the next day, since it was already late. 
44Ac 4:4 But many who heard the message believed; and the number grew to about five thousand. 
44Ac 4:5 The next day the Jewish leaders, the elders, and the teachers of the Law gathered in Jerusalem. 
44Ac 4:6 They met with the High Priest Annas and with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the others who belonged to the High Priest's family. 
44Ac 4:7 They made the apostles stand before them and asked them, "How did you do this? What power do you have or whose name did you use?" 
44Ac 4:8 Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, answered them, "Leaders of the people and elders£º 
44Ac 4:9 if we are being questioned today about the good deed done to the lame man and how he was healed, 
44Ac 4:10 then you should all know, and all the people of Israel should know, that this man stands here before you completely well through the power of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth - whom you crucified and whom God raised from death. 
44Ac 4:11 Jesus is the one of whom the scripture says, 'The stone that you the builders despised turned out to be the most important of all.' 
44Ac 4:12 Salvation is to be found through him alone; in all the world there is no one else whom God has given who can save us." 
44Ac 4:13 The members of the Council were amazed to see how bold Peter and John were and to learn that they were ordinary men of no education. They realized then that they had been companions of Jesus. 
44Ac 4:14 But there was nothing that they could say, because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with Peter and John. 
44Ac 4:15 So they told them to leave the Council room, and then they started discussing among themselves. 
44Ac 4:16 "What shall we do with these men?" they asked. "Everyone in Jerusalem knows that this extraordinary miracle has been performed by them, and we cannot deny it. 
44Ac 4:17 But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people, let us warn these men never again to speak to anyone in the name of Jesus." 
44Ac 4:18 So they called them back in and told them that under no condition were they to speak or to teach in the name of Jesus. 
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, "You yourselves judge which is right in God's sight - to obey you or to obey God. 
44Ac 4:20 For we cannot stop speaking of what we ourselves have seen and heard." 
44Ac 4:21 So the Council warned them even more strongly and then set them free. They saw that it was impossible to punish them, because the people were all praising God for what had happened. 
44Ac 4:22 The man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was over forty years old. 
44Ac 4:23 As soon as Peter and John were set free, they returned to their group and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said. 
44Ac 4:24 When the believers heard it, they all joined together in prayer to God£º "Master and Creator of heaven, earth, and sea, and all that is in them! 
44Ac 4:25 By means of the Holy Spirit you spoke through our ancestor David, your servant, when he said, 'Why were the Gentiles furious; why did people make their useless plots? 
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth prepared themselves, and the rulers met together against the Lord and his Messiah.' 
44Ac 4:27 For indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together in this city with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against Jesus, your holy Servant, whom you made Messiah. 
44Ac 4:28 They gathered to do everything that you by your power and will had already decided would happen. 
44Ac 4:29 And now, Lord, take notice of the threats they have made, and allow us, your servants, to speak your message with all boldness. 
44Ac 4:30 Reach out your hand to heal, and grant that wonders and miracles may be performed through the name of your holy Servant Jesus." 
44Ac 4:31 When they finished praying, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to proclaim God's message with boldness. 
44Ac 4:32 The group of believers was one in mind and heart. None of them said that any of their belongings were their own, but they all shared with one another everything they had. 
44Ac 4:33 With great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God poured rich blessings on them all. 
44Ac 4:34 There was no one in the group who was in need. Those who owned fields or houses would sell them, bring the money received from the sale, 
44Ac 4:35 and turn it over to the apostles; and the money was distributed according to the needs of the people. 
44Ac 4:36 And so it was that Joseph, a Levite born in Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means "One who Encourages"), 
44Ac 4:37 sold a field he owned, brought the money, and turned it over to the apostles. 
44Ac 5:1 But there was a man named Ananias, who with his wife Sapphira sold some property that belonged to them. 
44Ac 5:2 But with his wife's agreement he kept part of the money for himself and turned the rest over to the apostles. 
44Ac 5:3 Peter said to him, "Ananias, why did you let Satan take control of you and make you lie to the Holy Spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property? 
44Ac 5:4 Before you sold the property, it belonged to you; and after you sold it, the money was yours. Why, then, did you decide to do such a thing? You have not lied to people - you have lied to God!" 
44Ac 5:5 As soon as Ananias heard this, he fell down dead; and all who heard about it were terrified. 
44Ac 5:6 The young men came in, wrapped up his body, carried him out, and buried him. 
44Ac 5:7 About three hours later his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. 
44Ac 5:8 Peter asked her, "Tell me, was this the full amount you and your husband received for your property?" "Yes," she answered, "the full amount." 
44Ac 5:9 So Peter said to her, "Why did you and your husband decide to put the Lord's Spirit to the test? The men who buried your husband are at the door right now, and they will carry you out too!" 
44Ac 5:10 At once she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
44Ac 5:11 The whole church and all the others who heard of this were terrified. 
44Ac 5:12 Many miracles and wonders were being performed among the people by the apostles. All the believers met together in Solomon's Porch. 
44Ac 5:13 Nobody outside the group dared join them, even though the people spoke highly of them. 
44Ac 5:14 But more and more people were added to the group - a crowd of men and women who believed in the Lord. 
44Ac 5:15 As a result of what the apostles were doing, sick people were carried out into the streets and placed on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. 
44Ac 5:16 And crowds of people came in from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing those who were sick or who had evil spirits in them; and they were all healed. 
44Ac 5:17 Then the High Priest and all his companions, members of the local party of the Sadducees, became extremely jealous of the apostles; so they decided to take action. 
44Ac 5:18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. 
44Ac 5:19 But that night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, led the apostles out, and said to them, 
44Ac 5:20 "Go and stand in the Temple, and tell the people all about this new life." 
44Ac 5:21 The apostles obeyed, and at dawn they entered the Temple and started teaching. The High Priest and his companions called together all the Jewish elders for a full meeting of the Council; then they sent orders to the prison to have the apostles brought before them. 
44Ac 5:22 But when the officials arrived, they did not find the apostles in prison, so they returned to the Council and reported, 
44Ac 5:23 "When we arrived at the jail, we found it locked up tight and all the guards on watch at the gates; but when we opened the gates, we found no one inside!" 
44Ac 5:24 When the chief priests and the officer in charge of the Temple guards heard this, they wondered what had happened to the apostles. 
44Ac 5:25 Then a man came in and said to them, "Listen! The men you put in prison are in the Temple teaching the people!" 
44Ac 5:26 So the officer went off with his men and brought the apostles back. They did not use force, however, because they were afraid that the people might stone them. 
44Ac 5:27 They brought the apostles in, made them stand before the Council, and the High Priest questioned them. 
44Ac 5:28 "We gave you strict orders not to teach in the name of this man," he said; "but see what you have done! You have spread your teaching all over Jerusalem, and you want to make us responsible for his death!" 
44Ac 5:29 Peter and the other apostles answered, "We must obey God, not men. 
44Ac 5:30 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from death, after you had killed him by nailing him to a cross. 
44Ac 5:31 God raised him to his right side as Leader and Savior, to give the people of Israel the opportunity to repent and have their sins forgiven. 
44Ac 5:32 We are witnesses to these things - we and the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to those who obey him." 
44Ac 5:33 When the members of the Council heard this, they were so furious that they wanted to have the apostles put to death. 
44Ac 5:34 But one of them, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was a teacher of the Law and was highly respected by all the people, stood up in the Council. He ordered the apostles to be taken out for a while, 
44Ac 5:35 and then he said to the Council, "Fellow Israelites, be careful what you do to these men. 
44Ac 5:36 You remember that Theudas appeared some time ago, claiming to be somebody great, and about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, all his followers were scattered, and his movement died out. 
44Ac 5:37 After that, Judas the Galilean appeared during the time of the census; he drew a crowd after him, but he also was killed, and all his followers were scattered. 
44Ac 5:38 And so in this case, I tell you, do not take any action against these men. Leave them alone! If what they have planned and done is of human origin, it will disappear, 
44Ac 5:39 but if it comes from God, you cannot possibly defeat them. You could find yourselves fighting against God!" The Council followed Gamaliel's advice. 
44Ac 5:40 They called the apostles in, had them whipped, and ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus; and then they set them free. 
44Ac 5:41 As the apostles left the Council, they were happy, because God had considered them worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of Jesus. 
44Ac 5:42 And every day in the Temple and in people's homes they continued to teach and preach the Good News about Jesus the Messiah. 
44Ac 6:1 Some time later, as the number of disciples kept growing, there was a quarrel between the Greek-speaking Jews and the native Jews. The Greek-speaking Jews claimed that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of funds. 
44Ac 6:2 So the twelve apostles called the whole group of believers together and said, "It is not right for us to neglect the preaching of God's word in order to handle finances. 
44Ac 6:3 So then, friends, choose seven men among you who are known to be full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, and we will put them in charge of this matter. 
44Ac 6:4 We ourselves, then, will give our full time to prayer and the work of preaching." 
44Ac 6:5 The whole group was pleased with the apostles' proposal, so they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a Gentile from Antioch who had earlier been converted to Judaism. 
44Ac 6:6 The group presented them to the apostles, who prayed and placed their hands on them. 
44Ac 6:7 And so the word of God continued to spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew larger and larger, and a great number of priests accepted the faith. 
44Ac 6:8 Stephen, a man richly blessed by God and full of power, performed great miracles and wonders among the people. 
44Ac 6:9 But he was opposed by some men who were members of the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), which had Jews from Cyrene and Alexandria. They and other Jews from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia started arguing with Stephen. 
44Ac 6:10 But the Spirit gave Stephen such wisdom that when he spoke, they could not refute him. 
44Ac 6:11 So they bribed some men to say, "We heard him speaking against Moses and against God!" 
44Ac 6:12 In this way they stirred up the people, the elders, and the teachers of the Law. They seized Stephen and took him before the Council. 
44Ac 6:13 Then they brought in some men to tell lies about him. "This man," they said, "is always talking against our sacred Temple and the Law of Moses. 
44Ac 6:14 We heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will tear down the Temple and change all the customs which have come down to us from Moses!" 
44Ac 6:15 All those sitting in the Council fixed their eyes on Stephen and saw that his face looked like the face of an angel. 
44Ac 7:1 The High Priest asked Stephen, "Is this true?" 
44Ac 7:2 Stephen answered, "Brothers and fathers, listen to me! Before our ancestor Abraham had gone to live in Haran, the God of glory appeared to him in Mesopotamia 
44Ac 7:3 and said to him, 'Leave your family and country and go to the land that I will show you.' 
44Ac 7:4 And so he left his country and went to live in Haran. After Abraham's father died, God made him move to this land where you now live. 
44Ac 7:5 God did not then give Abraham any part of it as his own, not even a square foot of ground, but God promised to give it to him, and that it would belong to him and to his descendants. At the time God made this promise, Abraham had no children. 
44Ac 7:6 This is what God said to him£º 'Your descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be slaves and will be badly treated for four hundred years. 
44Ac 7:7 But I will pass judgment on the people that they will serve, and afterward your descendants will come out of that country and will worship me in this place.' 
44Ac 7:8 Then God gave to Abraham the ceremony of circumcision as a sign of the covenant. So Abraham circumcised Isaac a week after he was born; Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his twelve sons, the famous ancestors of our race. 
44Ac 7:9 "Jacob's sons became jealous of their brother Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him 
44Ac 7:10 and brought him safely through all his troubles. When Joseph appeared before the king of Egypt, God gave him a pleasing manner and wisdom, and the king made Joseph governor over the country and the royal household. 
44Ac 7:11 Then there was a famine all over Egypt and Canaan, which caused much suffering. Our ancestors could not find any food, 
44Ac 7:12 and when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent his sons, our ancestors, on their first visit there. 
44Ac 7:13 On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and the king of Egypt came to know about Joseph's family. 
44Ac 7:14 So Joseph sent a message to his father Jacob, telling him and the whole family, seventy-five people in all, to come to Egypt. 
44Ac 7:15 Then Jacob went to Egypt, where he and his sons died. 
44Ac 7:16 Their bodies were taken to Shechem, where they were buried in the grave which Abraham had bought from the clan of Hamor for a sum of money. 
44Ac 7:17 "When the time drew near for God to keep the promise he had made to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had grown much larger. 
44Ac 7:18 At last a king who did not know about Joseph began to rule in Egypt. 
44Ac 7:19 He tricked our ancestors and was cruel to them, forcing them to put their babies out of their homes, so that they would die. 
44Ac 7:20 It was at this time that Moses was born, a very beautiful child. He was cared for at home for three months, 
44Ac 7:21 and when he was put out of his home, the king's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. 
44Ac 7:22 He was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in words and deeds. 
44Ac 7:23 "When Moses was forty years old, he decided to find out how his fellow Israelites were being treated. 
44Ac 7:24 He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his help and took revenge on the Egyptian by killing him. 
44Ac 7:25 (He thought that his own people would understand that God was going to use him to set them free, but they did not understand.) 
44Ac 7:26 The next day he saw two Israelites fighting, and he tried to make peace between them. 'Listen, men,' he said, 'you are fellow Israelites; why are you fighting like this?' 
44Ac 7:27 But the one who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside. 'Who made you ruler and judge over us?' he asked. 
44Ac 7:28 'Do you want to kill me, just as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?' 
44Ac 7:29 When Moses heard this, he fled from Egypt and went to live in the land of Midian. There he had two sons. 
44Ac 7:30 "After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. 
44Ac 7:31 Moses was amazed by what he saw, and went near the bush to get a better look. But he heard the Lord's voice£º 
44Ac 7:32 'I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and dared not look. 
44Ac 7:33 The Lord said to him, 'Take your sandals off, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 
44Ac 7:34 I have seen the cruel suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans, and I have come down to set them free. Come now; I will send you to Egypt.' 
44Ac 7:35 "Moses is the one who was rejected by the people of Israel. 'Who made you ruler and judge over us?' they asked. He is the one whom God sent to rule the people and set them free with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush. 
44Ac 7:36 He led the people out of Egypt, performing miracles and wonders in Egypt and at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert. 
44Ac 7:37 Moses is the one who said to the people of Israel, 'God will send you a prophet, just as he sent me, and he will be one of your own people.' 
44Ac 7:38 He is the one who was with the people of Israel assembled in the desert; he was there with our ancestors and with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and he received God's living messages to pass on to us. 
44Ac 7:39 "But our ancestors refused to obey him; they pushed him aside and wished that they could go back to Egypt. 
44Ac 7:40 So they said to Aaron, 'Make us some gods who will lead us. We do not know what has happened to that man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt.' 
44Ac 7:41 It was then that they made an idol in the shape of a bull, offered sacrifice to it, and had a feast in honor of what they themselves had made. 
44Ac 7:42 So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the stars of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets£º 'People of Israel! It was not to me that you slaughtered and sacrificed animals for forty years in the desert. 
44Ac 7:43 It was the tent of the god Molech that you carried, and the image of Rephan, your star god; they were idols that you had made to worship. And so I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.' 
44Ac 7:44 "Our ancestors had the Tent of God's presence with them in the desert. It had been made as God had told Moses to make it, according to the pattern that Moses had been shown. 
44Ac 7:45 Later on, our ancestors who received the tent from their fathers carried it with them when they went with Joshua and took over the land from the nations that God drove out as they advanced. And it stayed there until the time of David. 
44Ac 7:46 He won God's favor and asked God to allow him to provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. 
44Ac 7:47 But it was Solomon who built him a house. 
44Ac 7:48 "But the Most High God does not live in houses built by human hands; as the prophet says, 
44Ac 7:49 'Heaven is my throne, says the Lord, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house would you build for me? Where is the place for me to live in? 
44Ac 7:50 Did not I myself make all these things?' 
44Ac 7:51 "How stubborn you are!" Stephen went on to say. "How heathen your hearts, how deaf you are to God's message! You are just like your ancestors£º you too have always resisted the Holy Spirit! 
44Ac 7:52 Was there any prophet that your ancestors did not persecute? They killed God's messengers, who long ago announced the coming of his righteous Servant. And now you have betrayed and murdered him. 
44Ac 7:53 You are the ones who received God's law, that was handed down by angels - yet you have not obeyed it!" 
44Ac 7:54 As the members of the Council listened to Stephen, they became furious and ground their teeth at him in anger. 
44Ac 7:55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw God's glory and Jesus standing at the right side of God. 
44Ac 7:56 "Look!" he said. "I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God!" 
44Ac 7:57 With a loud cry the Council members covered their ears with their hands. Then they all rushed at him at once, 
44Ac 7:58 threw him out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses left their cloaks in the care of a young man named Saul. 
44Ac 7:59 They kept on stoning Stephen as he called out to the Lord, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" 
44Ac 7:60 He knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, "Lord! Do not remember this sin against them!" He said this and died. 
44Ac 8:1 And Saul approved of his murder. That very day the church in Jerusalem began to suffer cruel persecution. All the believers, except the apostles, were scattered throughout the provinces of Judea and Samaria. 
44Ac 8:2 Some devout men buried Stephen, mourning for him with loud cries. 
44Ac 8:3 But Saul tried to destroy the church; going from house to house, he dragged out the believers, both men and women, and threw them into jail. 
44Ac 8:4 The believers who were scattered went everywhere, preaching the message. 
44Ac 8:5 Philip went to the principal city in Samaria and preached the Messiah to the people there. 
44Ac 8:6 The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, as they listened to him and saw the miracles that he performed. 
44Ac 8:7 Evil spirits came out from many people with a loud cry, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed. 
44Ac 8:8 So there was great joy in that city. 
44Ac 8:9 A man named Simon lived there, who for some time had astounded the Samaritans with his magic. He claimed that he was someone great, 
44Ac 8:10 and everyone in the city, from all classes of society, paid close attention to him. "He is that power of God known as 'The Great Power,' " they said. 
44Ac 8:11 They paid this attention to him because for such a long time he had astonished them with his magic. 
44Ac 8:12 But when they believed Philip's message about the good news of the Kingdom of God and about Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
44Ac 8:13 Simon himself also believed; and after being baptized, he stayed close to Philip and was astounded when he saw the great wonders and miracles that were being performed. 
44Ac 8:14 The apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had received the word of God, so they sent Peter and John to them. 
44Ac 8:15 When they arrived, they prayed for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 8:16 For the Holy Spirit had not yet come down on any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
44Ac 8:17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 8:18 Simon saw that the Spirit had been given to the believers when the apostles placed their hands on them. So he offered money to Peter and John, 
44Ac 8:19 and said, "Give this power to me too, so that anyone I place my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit." 
44Ac 8:20 But Peter answered him, "May you and your money go to hell, for thinking that you can buy God's gift with money! 
44Ac 8:21 You have no part or share in our work, because your heart is not right in God's sight. 
44Ac 8:22 Repent, then, of this evil plan of yours, and pray to the Lord that he will forgive you for thinking such a thing as this. 
44Ac 8:23 For I see that you are full of bitter envy and are a prisoner of sin." 
44Ac 8:24 Simon said to Peter and John, "Please pray to the Lord for me, so that none of these things you spoke of will happen to me." 
44Ac 8:25 After they had given their testimony and proclaimed the Lord's message, Peter and John went back to Jerusalem. On their way they preached the Good News in many villages of Samaria. 
44Ac 8:26 An angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Get ready and go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This road is not used nowadays.) 
44Ac 8:27 So Philip got ready and went. Now an Ethiopian eunuch, who was an important official in charge of the treasury of the queen of Ethiopia, was on his way home. 
44Ac 8:28 He had been to Jerusalem to worship God and was going back home in his carriage. As he rode along, he was reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah. 
44Ac 8:29 The Holy Spirit said to Philip, "Go over to that carriage and stay close to it." 
44Ac 8:30 Philip ran over and heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah. He asked him, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 
44Ac 8:31 The official replied, "How can I understand unless someone explains it to me?" And he invited Philip to climb up and sit in the carriage with him. 
44Ac 8:32 The passage of scripture which he was reading was this£º "He was like a sheep that is taken to be slaughtered, like a lamb that makes no sound when its wool is cut off. He did not say a word. 
44Ac 8:33 He was humiliated, and justice was denied him. No one will be able to tell about his descendants, because his life on earth has come to an end." 
44Ac 8:34 The official asked Philip, "Tell me, of whom is the prophet saying this? Of himself or of someone else?" 
44Ac 8:35 Then Philip began to speak; starting from this passage of scripture, he told him the Good News about Jesus. 
44Ac 8:36 As they traveled down the road, they came to a place where there was some water, and the official said, "Here is some water. What is to keep me from being baptized?" 
44Ac 8:37 OMITTED TEXT
44Ac 8:38 The official ordered the carriage to stop, and both Philip and the official went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. 
44Ac 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The official did not see him again, but continued on his way, full of joy. 
44Ac 8:40 Philip found himself in Azotus; he went on to Caesarea, and on the way he preached the Good News in every town. 
44Ac 9:1 In the meantime Saul kept up his violent threats of murder against the followers of the Lord. He went to the High Priest 
44Ac 9:2 and asked for letters of introduction to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he should find there any followers of the Way of the Lord, he would be able to arrest them, both men and women, and bring them back to Jerusalem. 
44Ac 9:3 As Saul was coming near the city of Damascus, suddenly a light from the sky flashed around him. 
44Ac 9:4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?" 
44Ac 9:5 "Who are you, Lord?" he asked. "I am Jesus, whom you persecute," the voice said. 
44Ac 9:6 "But get up and go into the city, where you will be told what you must do." 
44Ac 9:7 The men who were traveling with Saul had stopped, not saying a word; they heard the voice but could not see anyone. 
44Ac 9:8 Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes, but could not see a thing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus. 
44Ac 9:9 For three days he was not able to see, and during that time he did not eat or drink anything. 
44Ac 9:10 There was a believer in Damascus named Ananias. He had a vision, in which the Lord said to him, "Ananias!" "Here I am, Lord," he answered. 
44Ac 9:11 The Lord said to him, "Get ready and go to Straight Street, and at the house of Judas ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul. He is praying, 
44Ac 9:12 and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him so that he might see again." 
44Ac 9:13 Ananias answered, "Lord, many people have told me about this man and about all the terrible things he has done to your people in Jerusalem. 
44Ac 9:14 And he has come to Damascus with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who worship you." 
44Ac 9:15 The Lord said to him, "Go, because I have chosen him to serve me, to make my name known to Gentiles and kings and to the people of Israel. 
44Ac 9:16 And I myself will show him all that he must suffer for my sake." 
44Ac 9:17 So Ananias went, entered the house where Saul was, and placed his hands on him. "Brother Saul," he said, "the Lord has sent me - Jesus himself, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here. He sent me so that you might see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." 
44Ac 9:18 At once something like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he was able to see again. He stood up and was baptized; 
44Ac 9:19 and after he had eaten, his strength came back. Saul stayed for a few days with the believers in Damascus. 
44Ac 9:20 He went straight to the synagogues and began to preach that Jesus was the Son of God. 
44Ac 9:21 All who heard him were amazed and asked, "Isn't he the one who in Jerusalem was killing those who worship that man Jesus? And didn't he come here for the very purpose of arresting those people and taking them back to the chief priests?" 
44Ac 9:22 But Saul's preaching became even more powerful, and his proofs that Jesus was the Messiah were so convincing that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not answer him. 
44Ac 9:23 After many days had gone by, the Jews met together and made plans to kill Saul, 
44Ac 9:24 but he was told of their plan. Day and night they watched the city gates in order to kill him. 
44Ac 9:25 But one night Saul's followers took him and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
44Ac 9:26 Saul went to Jerusalem and tried to join the disciples. But they would not believe that he was a disciple, and they were all afraid of him. 
44Ac 9:27 Then Barnabas came to his help and took him to the apostles. He explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had spoken to him. He also told them how boldly Saul had preached in the name of Jesus in Damascus. 
44Ac 9:28 And so Saul stayed with them and went all over Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. 
44Ac 9:29 He also talked and disputed with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to kill him. 
44Ac 9:30 When the believers found out about this, they took Saul to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus. 
44Ac 9:31 And so it was that the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had a time of peace. Through the help of the Holy Spirit it was strengthened and grew in numbers, as it lived in reverence for the Lord. 
44Ac 9:32 Peter traveled everywhere, and on one occasion he went to visit God's people who lived in Lydda. 
44Ac 9:33 There he met a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for eight years. 
44Ac 9:34 "Aeneas," Peter said to him, "Jesus Christ makes you well. Get up and make your bed." At once Aeneas got up. 
44Ac 9:35 All the people living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. 
44Ac 9:36 In Joppa there was a woman named Tabitha, who was a believer. (Her name in Greek is Dorcas, meaning "a deer.") She spent all her time doing good and helping the poor. 
44Ac 9:37 At that time she got sick and died. Her body was washed and laid in a room upstairs. 
44Ac 9:38 Joppa was not very far from Lydda, and when the believers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him with the message, "Please hurry and come to us." 
44Ac 9:39 So Peter got ready and went with them. When he arrived, he was taken to the room upstairs, where all the widows crowded around him, crying and showing him all the shirts and coats that Dorcas had made while she was alive. 
44Ac 9:40 Peter put them all out of the room, and knelt down and prayed; then he turned to the body and said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
44Ac 9:41 Peter reached over and helped her get up. Then he called all the believers, including the widows, and presented her alive to them. 
44Ac 9:42 The news about this spread all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. 
44Ac 9:43 Peter stayed on in Joppa for many days with a tanner of leather named Simon. 
44Ac 10:1 There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, who was a captain in the Roman army regiment called "The Italian Regiment." 
44Ac 10:2 He was a religious man; he and his whole family worshiped God. He also did much to help the Jewish poor people and was constantly praying to God. 
44Ac 10:3 It was about three o'clock one afternoon when he had a vision, in which he clearly saw an angel of God come in and say to him, "Cornelius!" 
44Ac 10:4 He stared at the angel in fear and said, "What is it, sir?" The angel answered, "God is pleased with your prayers and works of charity, and is ready to answer you. 
44Ac 10:5 And now send some men to Joppa for a certain man whose full name is Simon Peter. 
44Ac 10:6 He is a guest in the home of a tanner of leather named Simon, who lives by the sea." 
44Ac 10:7 Then the angel went away, and Cornelius called two of his house servants and a soldier, a religious man who was one of his personal attendants. 
44Ac 10:8 He told them what had happened and sent them off to Joppa. 
44Ac 10:9 The next day, as they were on their way and coming near Joppa, Peter went up on the roof of the house about noon in order to pray. 
44Ac 10:10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat; while the food was being prepared, he had a vision. 
44Ac 10:11 He saw heaven opened and something coming down that looked like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners to the earth. 
44Ac 10:12 In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles, and wild birds. 
44Ac 10:13 A voice said to him, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!" 
44Ac 10:14 But Peter said, "Certainly not, Lord! I have never eaten anything ritually unclean or defiled." 
44Ac 10:15 The voice spoke to him again, "Do not consider anything unclean that God has declared clean." 
44Ac 10:16 This happened three times, and then the thing was taken back up into heaven. 
44Ac 10:17 While Peter was wondering about the meaning of this vision, the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon's house was, and they were now standing in front of the gate. 
44Ac 10:18 They called out and asked, "Is there a guest here by the name of Simon Peter?" 
44Ac 10:19 Peter was still trying to understand what the vision meant, when the Spirit said, "Listen! Three men are here looking for you. 
44Ac 10:20 So get ready and go down, and do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them." 
44Ac 10:21 So Peter went down and said to the men, "I am the man you are looking for. Why have you come?" 
44Ac 10:22 "Captain Cornelius sent us," they answered. "He is a good man who worships God and is highly respected by all the Jewish people. An angel of God told him to invite you to his house, so that he could hear what you have to say." 
44Ac 10:23 Peter invited the men in and had them spend the night there. The next day he got ready and went with them; and some of the believers from Joppa went along with him. 
44Ac 10:24 The following day he arrived in Caesarea, where Cornelius was waiting for him, together with relatives and close friends that he had invited. 
44Ac 10:25 As Peter was about to go in, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and bowed down before him. 
44Ac 10:26 But Peter made him rise. "Stand up," he said, "I myself am only a man." 
44Ac 10:27 Peter kept on talking to Cornelius as he went into the house, where he found many people gathered. 
44Ac 10:28 He said to them, "You yourselves know very well that a Jew is not allowed by his religion to visit or associate with Gentiles. But God has shown me that I must not consider any person ritually unclean or defiled. 
44Ac 10:29 And so when you sent for me, I came without any objection. I ask you, then, why did you send for me?" 
44Ac 10:30 Cornelius said, "It was about this time three days ago that I was praying in my house at three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly a man dressed in shining clothes stood in front of me 
44Ac 10:31 and said£º 'Cornelius! God has heard your prayer and has taken notice of your works of charity. 
44Ac 10:32 Send someone to Joppa for a man whose full name is Simon Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner of leather, who lives by the sea.' 
44Ac 10:33 And so I sent for you at once, and you have been good enough to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God, waiting to hear anything that the Lord has instructed you to say." 
44Ac 10:34 Peter began to speak£º "I now realize that it is true that God treats everyone on the same basis. 
44Ac 10:35 Those who fear him and do what is right are acceptable to him, no matter what race they belong to. 
44Ac 10:36 You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 
44Ac 10:37 You know of the great event that took place throughout the land of Israel, beginning in Galilee after John preached his message of baptism. 
44Ac 10:38 You know about Jesus of Nazareth and how God poured out on him the Holy Spirit and power. He went everywhere, doing good and healing all who were under the power of the Devil, for God was with him. 
44Ac 10:39 We are witnesses of everything that he did in the land of Israel and in Jerusalem. Then they put him to death by nailing him to a cross. 
44Ac 10:40 But God raised him from death three days later and caused him to appear, 
44Ac 10:41 not to everyone, but only to the witnesses that God had already chosen, that is, to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from death. 
44Ac 10:42 And he commanded us to preach the gospel to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God has appointed judge of the living and the dead. 
44Ac 10:43 All the prophets spoke about him, saying that all who believe in him will have their sins forgiven through the power of his name." 
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening to his message. 
44Ac 10:45 The Jewish believers who had come from Joppa with Peter were amazed that God had poured out his gift of the Holy Spirit on the Gentiles also. 
44Ac 10:46 For they heard them speaking in strange tongues and praising God's greatness. Peter spoke up£º 
44Ac 10:47 "These people have received the Holy Spirit, just as we also did. Can anyone, then, stop them from being baptized with water?" 
44Ac 10:48 So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay with them for a few days. 
44Ac 11:1 The apostles and the other believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
44Ac 11:2 When Peter went to Jerusalem, those who were in favor of circumcising Gentiles criticized him, saying, 
44Ac 11:3 "You were a guest in the home of uncircumcised Gentiles, and you even ate with them!" 
44Ac 11:4 So Peter gave them a complete account of what had happened from the very beginning£º 
44Ac 11:5 "While I was praying in the city of Joppa, I had a vision. I saw something coming down that looked like a large sheet being lowered by its four corners from heaven, and it stopped next to me. 
44Ac 11:6 I looked closely inside and saw domesticated and wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds. 
44Ac 11:7 Then I heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat!' 
44Ac 11:8 But I said, 'Certainly not, Lord! No ritually unclean or defiled food has ever entered my mouth.' 
44Ac 11:9 The voice spoke again from heaven, 'Do not consider anything unclean that God has declared clean.' 
44Ac 11:10 This happened three times, and finally the whole thing was drawn back up into heaven. 
44Ac 11:11 At that very moment three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where I was staying. 
44Ac 11:12 The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six fellow believers from Joppa accompanied me to Caesarea, and we all went into the house of Cornelius. 
44Ac 11:13 He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, 'Send someone to Joppa for a man whose full name is Simon Peter. 
44Ac 11:14 He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved.' 
44Ac 11:15 And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came down on them just as on us at the beginning. 
44Ac 11:16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said£º 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 
44Ac 11:17 It is clear that God gave those Gentiles the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, then, to try to stop God!" 
44Ac 11:18 When they heard this, they stopped their criticism and praised God, saying, "Then God has given to the Gentiles also the opportunity to repent and live!" 
44Ac 11:19 Some of the believers who were scattered by the persecution which took place when Stephen was killed went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message to Jews only. 
44Ac 11:20 But other believers, who were from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and proclaimed the message to Gentiles also, telling them the Good News about the Lord Jesus. 
44Ac 11:21 The Lord's power was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. 
44Ac 11:22 The news about this reached the church in Jerusalem, so they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
44Ac 11:23 When he arrived and saw how God had blessed the people, he was glad and urged them all to be faithful and true to the Lord with all their hearts. 
44Ac 11:24 Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and many people were brought to the Lord. 
44Ac 11:25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul. 
44Ac 11:26 When he found him, he took him to Antioch, and for a whole year the two met with the people of the church and taught a large group. It was at Antioch that the believers were first called Christians. 
44Ac 11:27 About that time some prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
44Ac 11:28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and by the power of the Spirit predicted that a severe famine was about to come over all the earth. (It came when Claudius was emperor.) 
44Ac 11:29 The disciples decided that they each would send as much as they could to help their fellow believers who lived in Judea. 
44Ac 11:30 They did this, then, and sent the money to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul. 
44Ac 12:1 About this time King Herod began to persecute some members of the church. 
44Ac 12:2 He had James, the brother of John, put to death by the sword. 
44Ac 12:3 When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he went ahead and had Peter arrested. (This happened during the time of the Festival of Unleavened Bread.) 
44Ac 12:4 After his arrest Peter was put in jail, where he was handed over to be guarded by four groups of four soldiers each. Herod planned to put him on trial in public after Passover. 
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in jail, but the people of the church were praying earnestly to God for him. 
44Ac 12:6 The night before Herod was going to bring him out to the people, Peter was sleeping between two guards. He was tied with two chains, and there were guards on duty at the prison gate. 
44Ac 12:7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there, and a light shone in the cell. The angel shook Peter by the shoulder, woke him up, and said, "Hurry! Get up!" At once the chains fell off Peter's hands. 
44Ac 12:8 Then the angel said, "Tighten your belt and put on your sandals." Peter did so, and the angel said, "Put your cloak around you and come with me." 
44Ac 12:9 Peter followed him out of the prison, not knowing, however, if what the angel was doing was real; he thought he was seeing a vision. 
44Ac 12:10 They passed by the first guard station and then the second, and came at last to the iron gate that opens into the city. The gate opened for them by itself, and they went out. They walked down a street, and suddenly the angel left Peter. 
44Ac 12:11 Then Peter realized what had happened to him, and said, "Now I know that it is really true! The Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod's power and from everything the Jewish people expected to happen." 
44Ac 12:12 Aware of his situation, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. 
44Ac 12:13 Peter knocked at the outside door, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer it. 
44Ac 12:14 She recognized Peter's voice and was so happy that she ran back in without opening the door, and announced that Peter was standing outside. 
44Ac 12:15 "You are crazy!" they told her. But she insisted that it was true. So they answered, "It is his angel." 
44Ac 12:16 Meanwhile Peter kept on knocking. At last they opened the door, and when they saw him, they were amazed. 
44Ac 12:17 He motioned with his hand for them to be quiet, and he explained to them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell this to James and the rest of the believers," he said; then he left and went somewhere else. 
44Ac 12:18 When morning came, there was a tremendous confusion among the guards - what had happened to Peter? 
44Ac 12:19 Herod gave orders to search for him, but they could not find him. So he had the guards questioned and ordered them put to death. After this, Herod left Judea and spent some time in Caesarea. 
44Ac 12:20 Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, so they went in a group to see him. First they convinced Blastus, the man in charge of the palace, that he should help them. Then they went to Herod and asked him for peace, because their country got its food supplies from the king's country. 
44Ac 12:21 On a chosen day Herod put on his royal robes, sat on his throne, and made a speech to the people. 
44Ac 12:22 "It isn't a man speaking, but a god!" they shouted. 
44Ac 12:23 At once the angel of the Lord struck Herod down, because he did not give honor to God. He was eaten by worms and died. 
44Ac 12:24 Meanwhile the word of God continued to spread and grow. 
44Ac 12:25 Barnabas and Saul finished their mission and returned from Jerusalem, taking John Mark with them. 
44Ac 13:1 In the church at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers£º Barnabas, Simeon (called the Black), Lucius (from Cyrene), Manaen (who had been brought up with Governor Herod ), and Saul. 
44Ac 13:2 While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to do the work to which I have called them." 
44Ac 13:3 They fasted and prayed, placed their hands on them, and sent them off. 
44Ac 13:4 Having been sent by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went to Seleucia and sailed from there to the island of Cyprus. 
44Ac 13:5 When they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues. They had John Mark with them to help in the work. 
44Ac 13:6 They went all the way across the island to Paphos, where they met a certain magician named Bar-Jesus, a Jew who claimed to be a prophet. 
44Ac 13:7 He was a friend of the governor of the island, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. The governor called Barnabas and Saul before him because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
44Ac 13:8 But they were opposed by the magician Elymas (that is his name in Greek), who tried to turn the governor away from the faith. 
44Ac 13:9 Then Saul - also known as Paul - was filled with the Holy Spirit; he looked straight at the magician 
44Ac 13:10 and said, "You son of the Devil! You are the enemy of everything that is good. You are full of all kinds of evil tricks, and you always keep trying to turn the Lord's truths into lies! 
44Ac 13:11 The Lord's hand will come down on you now; you will be blind and will not see the light of day for a time." At once Elymas felt a dark mist cover his eyes, and he walked around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand. 
44Ac 13:12 When the governor saw what had happened, he believed; for he was greatly amazed at the teaching about the Lord. 
44Ac 13:13 Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga, a city in Pamphylia, where John Mark left them and went back to Jerusalem. 
44Ac 13:14 They went on from Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia, and on the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
44Ac 13:15 After the reading from the Law of Moses and from the writings of the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message£º "Friends, we want you to speak to the people if you have a message of encouragement for them." 
44Ac 13:16 Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and began to speak£º "Fellow Israelites and all Gentiles here who worship God£º hear me! 
44Ac 13:17 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors and made the people a great nation during the time they lived as foreigners in Egypt. God brought them out of Egypt by his great power, 
44Ac 13:18 and for forty years he endured them in the desert. 
44Ac 13:19 He destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and made his people the owners of the land. 
44Ac 13:20 All of this took about 450 years. "After this he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. 
44Ac 13:21 And when they asked for a king, God gave them Saul son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin, to be their king for forty years. 
44Ac 13:22 After removing him, God made David their king. This is what God said about him£º 'I have found that David son of Jesse is the kind of man I like, a man who will do all I want him to do.' 
44Ac 13:23 It was Jesus, a descendant of David, whom God made the Savior of the people of Israel, as he had promised. 
44Ac 13:24 Before Jesus began his work, John preached to all the people of Israel that they should turn from their sins and be baptized. 
44Ac 13:25 And as John was about to finish his mission, he said to the people, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the one you are waiting for. But listen! He is coming after me, and I am not good enough to take his sandals off his feet.' 
44Ac 13:26 "My fellow Israelites, descendants of Abraham, and all Gentiles here who worship God£º it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent! 
44Ac 13:27 For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders did not know that he is the Savior, nor did they understand the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. Yet they made the prophets' words come true by condemning Jesus. 
44Ac 13:28 And even though they could find no reason to pass the death sentence on him, they asked Pilate to have him put to death. 
44Ac 13:29 And after they had done everything that the Scriptures say about him, they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb. 
44Ac 13:30 But God raised him from death, 
44Ac 13:31 and for many days he appeared to those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now witnesses for him to the people of Israel. 
44Ac 13:32 And we are here to bring the Good News to you£º what God promised our ancestors he would do, he has now done for us, who are their descendants, by raising Jesus to life.
44Ac 13:33 As it is written in the second Psalm, 'You are my Son; today I have become your Father.' 
44Ac 13:34 And this is what God said about raising him from death, never to rot away in the grave£º 'I will give you the sacred and sure blessings that I promised to David.' 
44Ac 13:35 As indeed he says in another passage, 'You will not allow your faithful servant to rot in the grave.' 
44Ac 13:36 For David served God's purposes in his own time, and then he died, was buried with his ancestors, and his body rotted in the grave. 
44Ac 13:37 But this did not happen to the one whom God raised from death. 
44Ac 13:38 All of you, my fellow Israelites, are to know for sure that it is through Jesus that the message about forgiveness of sins is preached to you; 
44Ac 13:39 you are to know that everyone who believes in him is set free from all the sins from which the Law of Moses could not set you free. 
44Ac 13:40 Take care, then, so that what the prophets said may not happen to you£º 
44Ac 13:41 'Look, you scoffers! Be astonished and die! For what I am doing today is something that you will not believe, even when someone explains it to you!' " 
44Ac 13:42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to come back the next Sabbath and tell them more about these things. 
44Ac 13:43 After the people had left the meeting, Paul and Barnabas were followed by many Jews and by many Gentiles who had been converted to Judaism. The apostles spoke to them and encouraged them to keep on living in the grace of God. 
44Ac 13:44 The next Sabbath nearly everyone in the town came to hear the word of the Lord. 
44Ac 13:45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy; they disputed what Paul was saying and insulted him. 
44Ac 13:46 But Paul and Barnabas spoke out even more boldly£º "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we will leave you and go to the Gentiles. 
44Ac 13:47 For this is the commandment that the Lord has given us£º 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, so that all the world may be saved.' " 
44Ac 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the Lord's message; and those who had been chosen for eternal life became believers. 
44Ac 13:49 The word of the Lord spread everywhere in that region. 
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews stirred up the leading men of the city and the Gentile women of high social standing who worshiped God. They started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their region. 
44Ac 13:51 The apostles shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went on to Iconium. 
44Ac 13:52 The believers in Antioch were full of joy and the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 14:1 The same thing happened in Iconium£º Paul and Barnabas went to the synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of Jews and Gentiles became believers. 
44Ac 14:2 But the Jews who would not believe stirred up the Gentiles and turned them against the believers. 
44Ac 14:3 The apostles stayed there for a long time, speaking boldly about the Lord, who proved that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to perform miracles and wonders. 
44Ac 14:4 The people of the city were divided£º some were for the Jews, others for the apostles. 
44Ac 14:5 Then some Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, decided to mistreat the apostles and stone them. 
44Ac 14:6 When the apostles learned about it, they fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia and to the surrounding territory. 
44Ac 14:7 There they preached the Good News. 
44Ac 14:8 In Lystra there was a crippled man who had been lame from birth and had never been able to walk. 
44Ac 14:9 He sat there and listened to Paul's words. Paul saw that he believed and could be healed, so he looked straight at him 
44Ac 14:10 and said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet!" The man jumped up and started walking around. 
44Ac 14:11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they started shouting in their own Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us!" 
44Ac 14:12 They gave Barnabas the name Zeus, and Paul the name Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. 
44Ac 14:13 The priest of the god Zeus, whose temple stood just outside the town, brought bulls and flowers to the gate, for he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifice to the apostles. 
44Ac 14:14 When Barnabas and Paul heard what they were about to do, they tore their clothes and ran into the middle of the crowd, shouting, 
44Ac 14:15 "Why are you doing this? We ourselves are only human beings like you! We are here to announce the Good News, to turn you away from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven, earth, sea, and all that is in them. 
44Ac 14:16 In the past he allowed all people to go their own way. 
44Ac 14:17 But he has always given evidence of his existence by the good things he does£º he gives you rain from heaven and crops at the right times; he gives you food and fills your hearts with happiness." 
44Ac 14:18 Even with these words the apostles could hardly keep the crowd from offering a sacrifice to them. 
44Ac 14:19 Some Jews came from Antioch in Pisidia and from Iconium; they won the crowds over to their side, stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking that he was dead. 
44Ac 14:20 But when the believers gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town. The next day he and Barnabas went to Derbe. 
44Ac 14:21 Paul and Barnabas preached the Good News in Derbe and won many disciples. Then they went back to Lystra, to Iconium, and on to Antioch in Pisidia. 
44Ac 14:22 They strengthened the believers and encouraged them to remain true to the faith. "We must pass through many troubles to enter the Kingdom of God," they taught. 
44Ac 14:23 In each church they appointed elders, and with prayers and fasting they commended them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust. 
44Ac 14:24 After going through the territory of Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
44Ac 14:25 There they preached the message in Perga and then went to Attalia, 
44Ac 14:26 and from there they sailed back to Antioch, the place where they had been commended to the care of God's grace for the work they had now completed. 
44Ac 14:27 When they arrived in Antioch, they gathered the people of the church together and told them about all that God had done with them and how he had opened the way for the Gentiles to believe. 
44Ac 14:28 And they stayed a long time there with the believers. 
44Ac 15:1 Some men came from Judea to Antioch and started teaching the believers, "You cannot be saved unless you are circumcised as the Law of Moses requires." 
44Ac 15:2 Paul and Barnabas got into a fierce argument with them about this, so it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others in Antioch should go to Jerusalem and see the apostles and elders about this matter. 
44Ac 15:3 They were sent on their way by the church; and as they went through Phoenicia and Samaria, they reported how the Gentiles had turned to God; this news brought great joy to all the believers. 
44Ac 15:4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, to whom they told all that God had done through them. 
44Ac 15:5 But some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and told to obey the Law of Moses." 
44Ac 15:6 The apostles and the elders met together to consider this question. 
44Ac 15:7 After a long debate Peter stood up and said, "My friends, you know that a long time ago God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the Gentiles, so that they could hear and believe. 
44Ac 15:8 And God, who knows the thoughts of everyone, showed his approval of the Gentiles by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he had to us. 
44Ac 15:9 He made no difference between us and them; he forgave their sins because they believed. 
44Ac 15:10 So then, why do you now want to put God to the test by laying a load on the backs of the believers which neither our ancestors nor we ourselves were able to carry? 
44Ac 15:11 No! We believe and are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are." 
44Ac 15:12 The whole group was silent as they heard Barnabas and Paul report all the miracles and wonders that God had performed through them among the Gentiles. 
44Ac 15:13 When they had finished speaking, James spoke up£º "Listen to me, my friends! 
44Ac 15:14 Simon has just explained how God first showed his care for the Gentiles by taking from among them a people to belong to him. 
44Ac 15:15 The words of the prophets agree completely with this. As the scripture says, 
44Ac 15:16 'After this I will return, says the Lord, and restore the kingdom of David. I will rebuild its ruins and make it strong again. 
44Ac 15:17 And so all the rest of the human race will come to me, all the Gentiles whom I have called to be my own. 
44Ac 15:18 So says the Lord, who made this known long ago.' 
44Ac 15:19 "It is my opinion," James went on, "that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God. 
44Ac 15:20 Instead, we should write a letter telling them not to eat any food that is ritually unclean because it has been offered to idols; to keep themselves from sexual immorality; and not to eat any animal that has been strangled, or any blood. 
44Ac 15:21 For the Law of Moses has been read for a very long time in the synagogues every Sabbath, and his words are preached in every town." 
44Ac 15:22 Then the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, decided to choose some men from the group and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose two men who were highly respected by the believers, Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, 
44Ac 15:23 and they sent the following letter by them£º 
44Ac 15:24 We have heard that some who went from our group have troubled and upset you by what they said; they had not, however, received any instruction from us. 
44Ac 15:25 And so we have met together and have all agreed to choose some messengers and send them to you. They will go with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, 
44Ac 15:26 who have risked their lives in the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
44Ac 15:27 We send you, then, Judas and Silas, who will tell you in person the same things we are writing. 
44Ac 15:28 The Holy Spirit and we have agreed not to put any other burden on you besides these necessary rules£º 
44Ac 15:29 eat no food that has been offered to idols; eat no blood; eat no animal that has been strangled; and keep yourselves from sexual immorality. You will do well if you take care not to do these things. With our best wishes." 
44Ac 15:30 The messengers were sent off and went to Antioch, where they gathered the whole group of believers and gave them the letter. 
44Ac 15:31 When the people read it, they were filled with joy by the message of encouragement. 
44Ac 15:32 Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, spoke a long time with them, giving them courage and strength. 
44Ac 15:33 After spending some time there, they were sent off in peace by the believers and went back to those who had sent them. 
44Ac 15:34 OMITTED TEXT
44Ac 15:35 Paul and Barnabas spent some time in Antioch, and together with many others they taught and preached the word of the Lord. 
44Ac 15:36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the believers in every town where we preached the word of the Lord, and let us find out how they are getting along." 
44Ac 15:37 Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them, 
44Ac 15:38 but Paul did not think it was right to take him, because he had not stayed with them to the end of their mission, but had turned back and left them in Pamphylia. 
44Ac 15:39 There was a sharp argument, and they separated£º Barnabas took Mark and sailed off for Cyprus, 
44Ac 15:40 while Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the care of the Lord's grace. 
44Ac 15:41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. 
44Ac 16:1 Paul traveled on to Derbe and Lystra, where a Christian named Timothy lived. His mother, who was also a Christian, was Jewish, but his father was a Greek. 
44Ac 16:2 All the believers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of Timothy. 
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted to take Timothy along with him, so he circumcised him. He did so because all the Jews who lived in those places knew that Timothy's father was Greek. 
44Ac 16:4 As they went through the towns, they delivered to the believers the rules decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, and they told them to obey those rules. 
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were made stronger in the faith and grew in numbers every day. 
44Ac 16:6 They traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit did not let them preach the message in the province of Asia. 
44Ac 16:7 When they reached the border of Mysia, they tried to go into the province of Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. 
44Ac 16:8 So they traveled right on through Mysia and went to Troas. 
44Ac 16:9 That night Paul had a vision in which he saw a Macedonian standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us!" 
44Ac 16:10 As soon as Paul had this vision, we got ready to leave for Macedonia, because we decided that God had called us to preach the Good News to the people there. 
44Ac 16:11 We left by ship from Troas and sailed straight across to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis. 
44Ac 16:12 From there we went inland to Philippi, a city of the first district of Macedonia; it is also a Roman colony. We spent several days there. 
44Ac 16:13 On the Sabbath we went out of the city to the riverside, where we thought there would be a place where Jews gathered for prayer. We sat down and talked to the women who gathered there. 
44Ac 16:14 One of those who heard us was Lydia from Thyatira, who was a dealer in purple cloth. She was a woman who worshiped God, and the Lord opened her mind to pay attention to what Paul was saying. 
44Ac 16:15 After she and the people of her house had been baptized, she invited us, "Come and stay in my house if you have decided that I am a true believer in the Lord." And she persuaded us to go. 
44Ac 16:16 One day as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a young servant woman who had an evil spirit that enabled her to predict the future. She earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes. 
44Ac 16:17 She followed Paul and us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God! They announce to you how you can be saved!" 
44Ac 16:18 She did this for many days, until Paul became so upset that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ I order you to come out of her!" The spirit went out of her that very moment. 
44Ac 16:19 When her owners realized that their chance of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the authorities in the public square. 
44Ac 16:20 They brought them before the Roman officials and said, "These men are Jews, and they are causing trouble in our city. 
44Ac 16:21 They are teaching customs that are against our law; we are Roman citizens, and we cannot accept these customs or practice them." 
44Ac 16:22 And the crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas. Then the officials tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered them to be whipped. 
44Ac 16:23 After a severe beating, they were thrown into jail, and the jailer was ordered to lock them up tight. 
44Ac 16:24 Upon receiving this order, the jailer threw them into the inner cell and fastened their feet between heavy blocks of wood. 
44Ac 16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 
44Ac 16:26 Suddenly there was a violent earthquake, which shook the prison to its foundations. At once all the doors opened, and the chains fell off all the prisoners. 
44Ac 16:27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he thought that the prisoners had escaped; so he pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself. 
44Ac 16:28 But Paul shouted at the top of his voice, "Don't harm yourself ! We are all here!" 
44Ac 16:29 The jailer called for a light, rushed in, and fell trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas. 
44Ac 16:30 Then he led them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" 
44Ac 16:31 They answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved - you and your family." 
44Ac 16:32 Then they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in the house. 
44Ac 16:33 At that very hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; and he and all his family were baptized at once. 
44Ac 16:34 Then he took Paul and Silas up into his house and gave them some food to eat. He and his family were filled with joy, because they now believed in God. 
44Ac 16:35 The next morning the Roman authorities sent police officers with the order, "Let those men go." 
44Ac 16:36 So the jailer told Paul, "The officials have sent an order for you and Silas to be released. You may leave, then, and go in peace." 
44Ac 16:37 But Paul said to the police officers, "We were not found guilty of any crime, yet they whipped us in public - and we are Roman citizens! Then they threw us in prison. And now they want to send us away secretly? Not at all! The Roman officials themselves must come here and let us out." 
44Ac 16:38 The police officers reported these words to the Roman officials; and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid. 
44Ac 16:39 So they went and apologized to them; then they led them out of the prison and asked them to leave the city. 
44Ac 16:40 Paul and Silas left the prison and went to Lydia's house. There they met the believers, spoke words of encouragement to them, and left. 
44Ac 17:1 Paul and Silas traveled on through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue. 
44Ac 17:2 According to his usual habit Paul went to the synagogue. There during three Sabbaths he held discussions with the people, quoting 
44Ac 17:3 and explaining the Scriptures, and proving from them that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from death. "This Jesus whom I announce to you," Paul said, "is the Messiah." 
44Ac 17:4 Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas; so did many of the leading women and a large group of Greeks who worshiped God. 
44Ac 17:5 But some Jews were jealous and gathered worthless loafers from the streets and formed a mob. They set the whole city in an uproar and attacked the home of a man named Jason, in an attempt to find Paul and Silas and bring them out to the people. 
44Ac 17:6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city authorities and shouted, "These men have caused trouble everywhere! Now they have come to our city, 
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has kept them in his house. They are all breaking the laws of the Emperor, saying that there is another king, whose name is Jesus." 
44Ac 17:8 With these words they threw the crowd and the city authorities in an uproar. 
44Ac 17:9 The authorities made Jason and the others pay the required amount of money to be released, and then let them go. 
44Ac 17:10 As soon as night came, the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived, they went to the synagogue. 
44Ac 17:11 The people there were more open-minded than the people in Thessalonica. They listened to the message with great eagerness, and every day they studied the Scriptures to see if what Paul said was really true. 
44Ac 17:12 Many of them believed; and many Greek women of high social standing and many Greek men also believed. 
44Ac 17:13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul had preached the word of God in Berea also, they came there and started exciting and stirring up the mobs. 
44Ac 17:14 At once the believers sent Paul away to the coast; but both Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea. 
44Ac 17:15 The men who were taking Paul went with him as far as Athens and then returned to Berea with instructions from Paul that Silas and Timothy should join him as soon as possible. 
44Ac 17:16 While Paul was waiting in Athens for Silas and Timothy, he was greatly upset when he noticed how full of idols the city was. 
44Ac 17:17 So he held discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentiles who worshiped God, and also in the public square every day with the people who happened to come by. 
44Ac 17:18 Certain Epicurean and Stoic teachers also debated with him. Some of them asked, "What is this ignorant show-off trying to say?" Others answered, "He seems to be talking about foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection. 
44Ac 17:19 So they took Paul, brought him before the city council, the Areopagus, and said, "We would like to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about. 
44Ac 17:20 Some of the things we hear you say sound strange to us, and we would like to know what they mean." 
44Ac 17:21 (For all the citizens of Athens and the foreigners who lived there liked to spend all their time telling and hearing the latest new thing.) 
44Ac 17:22 Paul stood up in front of the city council and said, "I see that in every way you Athenians are very religious. 
44Ac 17:23 For as I walked through your city and looked at the places where you worship, I found an altar on which is written, 'To an Unknown God.' That which you worship, then, even though you do not know it, is what I now proclaim to you. 
44Ac 17:24 God, who made the world and everything in it, is Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by human hands. 
44Ac 17:25 Nor does he need anything that we can supply by working for him, since it is he himself who gives life and breath and everything else to everyone. 
44Ac 17:26 From one human being he created all races of people and made them live throughout the whole earth. He himself fixed beforehand the exact times and the limits of the places where they would live. 
44Ac 17:27 He did this so that they would look for him, and perhaps find him as they felt around for him. Yet God is actually not far from any one of us; 
44Ac 17:28 as someone has said, 'In him we live and move and exist.' It is as some of your poets have said, 'We too are his children.' 
44Ac 17:29 Since we are God's children, we should not suppose that his nature is anything like an image of gold or silver or stone, shaped by human art and skill. 
44Ac 17:30 God has overlooked the times when people did not know him, but now he commands all of them everywhere to turn away from their evil ways. 
44Ac 17:31 For he has fixed a day in which he will judge the whole world with justice by means of a man he has chosen. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising that man from death!" 
44Ac 17:32 When they heard Paul speak about a raising from death, some of them made fun of him, but others said, "We want to hear you speak about this again." 
44Ac 17:33 And so Paul left the meeting. 
44Ac 17:34 Some men joined him and believed, among whom was Dionysius, a member of the council; there was also a woman named Damaris, and some other people. 
44Ac 18:1 After this, Paul left Athens and went on to Corinth. 
44Ac 18:2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, for Emperor Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, 
44Ac 18:3 and stayed and worked with them, because he earned his living by making tents, just as they did. 
44Ac 18:4 He held discussions in the synagogue every Sabbath, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks. 
44Ac 18:5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul gave his whole time to preaching the message, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah. 
44Ac 18:6 When they opposed him and said evil things about him, he protested by shaking the dust from his clothes and saying to them, "If you are lost, you yourselves must take the blame for it! I am not responsible. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 
44Ac 18:7 So he left them and went to live in the house of a Gentile named Titius Justus, who worshiped God; his house was next to the synagogue. 
44Ac 18:8 Crispus, who was the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his family; and many other people in Corinth heard the message, believed, and were baptized. 
44Ac 18:9 One night Paul had a vision in which the Lord said to him, "Do not be afraid, but keep on speaking and do not give up, 
44Ac 18:10 for I am with you. No one will be able to harm you, for many in this city are my people." 
44Ac 18:11 So Paul stayed there for a year and a half, teaching the people the word of God. 
44Ac 18:12 When Gallio was made the Roman governor of Achaia, Jews there got together, seized Paul, and took him into court. 
44Ac 18:13 "This man," they said, "is trying to persuade people to worship God in a way that is against the law!" 
44Ac 18:14 Paul was about to speak when Gallio said to the Jews, "If this were a matter of some evil crime or wrong that has been committed, it would be reasonable for me to be patient with you Jews. 
44Ac 18:15 But since it is an argument about words and names and your own law, you yourselves must settle it. I will not be the judge of such things!" 
44Ac 18:16 And he drove them out of the court. 
44Ac 18:17 They all grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the court. But that did not bother Gallio a bit. 
44Ac 18:18 Paul stayed on with the believers in Corinth for many days, then left them and sailed off with Priscilla and Aquila for Syria. Before sailing from Cenchreae he had his head shaved because of a vow he had taken. 
44Ac 18:19 They arrived in Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He went into the synagogue and held discussions with the Jews. 
44Ac 18:20 The people asked him to stay longer, but he would not consent. 
44Ac 18:21 Instead, he told them as he left, "If it is the will of God, I will come back to you." And so he sailed from Ephesus. 
44Ac 18:22 When he arrived at Caesarea, he went to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and then went to Antioch. 
44Ac 18:23 After spending some time there, he left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the believers. 
44Ac 18:24 At that time a Jew named Apollos, who had been born in Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker and had a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. 
44Ac 18:25 He had been instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with great enthusiasm he proclaimed and taught correctly the facts about Jesus. However, he knew only the baptism of John. 
44Ac 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home with them and explained to him more correctly the Way of God. 
44Ac 18:27 Apollos then decided to go to Achaia, so the believers in Ephesus helped him by writing to the believers in Achaia, urging them to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a great help to those who through God's grace had become believers. 
44Ac 18:28 For with his strong arguments he defeated the Jews in public debates by proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah. 
44Ac 19:1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior of the province and arrived in Ephesus. There he found some disciples 
44Ac 19:2 and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?" "We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit," they answered. 
44Ac 19:3 "Well, then, what kind of baptism did you receive?" Paul asked. "The baptism of John," they answered. 
44Ac 19:4 Paul said, "The baptism of John was for those who turned from their sins; and he told the people of Israel to believe in the one who was coming after him - that is, in Jesus." 
44Ac 19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
44Ac 19:6 Paul placed his hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came upon them; they spoke in strange tongues and also proclaimed God's message. 
44Ac 19:7 They were about twelve men in all. 
44Ac 19:8 Paul went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly with the people, holding discussions with them and trying to convince them about the Kingdom of God. 
44Ac 19:9 But some of them were stubborn and would not believe, and before the whole group they said evil things about the Way of the Lord. So Paul left them and took the believers with him, and every day he held discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 
44Ac 19:10 This went on for two years, so that all the people who lived in the province of Asia, both Jews and Gentiles, heard the word of the Lord. 
44Ac 19:11 God was performing unusual miracles through Paul. 
44Ac 19:12 Even handkerchiefs and aprons he had used were taken to the sick, and their diseases were driven away, and the evil spirits would go out of them. 
44Ac 19:13 Some Jews who traveled around and drove out evil spirits also tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to do this. They said to the evil spirits, "I command you in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches." 
44Ac 19:14 Seven brothers, who were the sons of a Jewish High Priest named Sceva, were doing this. 
44Ac 19:15 But the evil spirit said to them, "I know Jesus, and I know about Paul; but you - who are you?" 
44Ac 19:16 The man who had the evil spirit in him attacked them with such violence that he overpowered them all. They ran away from his house, wounded and with their clothes torn off. 
44Ac 19:17 All the Jews and Gentiles who lived in Ephesus heard about this; they were all filled with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was given greater honor. 
44Ac 19:18 Many of the believers came, publicly admitting and revealing what they had done. 
44Ac 19:19 Many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in public. They added up the price of the books, and the total came to fifty thousand silver coins. 
44Ac 19:20 In this powerful way the word of the Lord kept spreading and growing stronger. 
44Ac 19:21 After these things had happened, Paul made up his mind to travel through Macedonia and Achaia and go on to Jerusalem. "After I go there," he said, "I must also see Rome." 
44Ac 19:22 So he sent Timothy and Erastus, two of his helpers, to Macedonia, while he spent more time in the province of Asia. 
44Ac 19:23 It was at this time that there was serious trouble in Ephesus because of the Way of the Lord. 
44Ac 19:24 A certain silversmith named Demetrius made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis, and his business brought a great deal of profit to the workers. 
44Ac 19:25 So he called them all together with others whose work was like theirs and said to them, "Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this work. 
44Ac 19:26 Now, you can see and hear for yourselves what this fellow Paul is doing. He says that hand-made gods are not gods at all, and he has succeeded in convincing many people, both here in Ephesus and in nearly the whole province of Asia. 
44Ac 19:27 There is the danger, then, that this business of ours will get a bad name. Not only that, but there is also the danger that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will come to mean nothing and that her greatness will be destroyed - the goddess worshiped by everyone in Asia and in all the world!" 
44Ac 19:28 As the crowd heard these words, they became furious and started shouting, "Great is Artemis of Ephesus!" 
44Ac 19:29 The uproar spread throughout the whole city. The mob grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were traveling with Paul, and rushed with them to the theater. 
44Ac 19:30 Paul himself wanted to go before the crowd, but the believers would not let him. 
44Ac 19:31 Some of the provincial authorities, who were his friends, also sent him a message begging him not to show himself in the theater. 
44Ac 19:32 Meanwhile the whole meeting was in an uproar£º some people were shouting one thing, others were shouting something else, because most of them did not even know why they had come together. 
44Ac 19:33 Some of the people concluded that Alexander was responsible, since the Jews made him go up to the front. Then Alexander motioned with his hand for the people to be silent, and he tried to make a speech of defense. 
44Ac 19:34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all shouted together the same thing for two hours£º "Great is Artemis of Ephesus!" 
44Ac 19:35 At last the city clerk was able to calm the crowd. "Fellow Ephesians!" he said. "Everyone knows that the city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone that fell down from heaven. 
44Ac 19:36 Nobody can deny these things. So then, you must calm down and not do anything reckless. 
44Ac 19:37 You have brought these men here even though they have not robbed temples or said evil things about our goddess. 
44Ac 19:38 If Demetrius and his workers have an accusation against anyone, we have the authorities and the regular days for court; charges can be made there. 
44Ac 19:39 But if there is something more that you want, it will have to be settled in a legal meeting of citizens. 
44Ac 19:40 For after what has happened today, there is the danger that we will be accused of a riot. There is no excuse for all this uproar, and we would not be able to give a good reason for it." 
44Ac 19:41 After saying this, he dismissed the meeting. 
44Ac 20:1 After the uproar died down, Paul called together the believers and with words of encouragement said good-bye to them. Then he left and went on to Macedonia. 
44Ac 20:2 He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many messages. Then he came to Achaia, 
44Ac 20:3 where he stayed three months. He was getting ready to go to Syria when he discovered that there were Jews plotting against him; so he decided to go back through Macedonia. 
44Ac 20:4 Sopater son of Pyrrhus, from Berea, went with him; so did Aristarchus and Secundus, from Thessalonica; Gaius, from Derbe; Tychicus and Trophimus, from the province of Asia; and Timothy. 
44Ac 20:5 They went ahead and waited for us in Troas. 
44Ac 20:6 We sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later we joined them in Troas, where we spent a week. 
44Ac 20:7 On Saturday evening we gathered together for the fellowship meal. Paul spoke to the people and kept on speaking until midnight, since he was going to leave the next day. 
44Ac 20:8 Many lamps were burning in the upstairs room where we were meeting. 
44Ac 20:9 A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window, and as Paul kept on talking, Eutychus got sleepier and sleepier, until he finally went sound asleep and fell from the third story to the ground. When they picked him up, he was dead. 
44Ac 20:10 But Paul went down and threw himself on him and hugged him. "Don't worry," he said, "he is still alive!" 
44Ac 20:11 Then he went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. After talking with them for a long time, even until sunrise, Paul left. 
44Ac 20:12 They took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted. 
44Ac 20:13 We went on ahead to the ship and sailed off to Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had told us to do this, because he was going there by land. 
44Ac 20:14 When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. 
44Ac 20:15 We sailed from there and arrived off Chios the next day. A day later we came to Samos, and the following day we reached Miletus. 
44Ac 20:16 Paul had decided to sail on by Ephesus, so as not to lose any time in the province of Asia. He was in a hurry to arrive in Jerusalem by the day of Pentecost, if at all possible. 
44Ac 20:17 From Miletus Paul sent a message to Ephesus, asking the elders of the church to meet him. 
44Ac 20:18 When they arrived, he said to them, "You know how I spent the whole time I was with you, from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia. 
44Ac 20:19 With all humility and many tears I did my work as the Lord's servant during the hard times that came to me because of the plots of some Jews. 
44Ac 20:20 You know that I did not hold back anything that would be of help to you as I preached and taught in public and in your homes. 
44Ac 20:21 To Jews and Gentiles alike I gave solemn warning that they should turn from their sins to God and believe in our Lord Jesus. 
44Ac 20:22 And now, in obedience to the Holy Spirit I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. 
44Ac 20:23 I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit has warned me that prison and troubles wait for me. 
44Ac 20:24 But I reckon my own life to be worth nothing to me; I only want to complete my mission and finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do, which is to declare the Good News about the grace of God. 
44Ac 20:25 "I have gone about among all of you, preaching the Kingdom of God. And now I know that none of you will ever see me again. 
44Ac 20:26 So I solemnly declare to you this very day£º if any of you should be lost, I am not responsible. 
44Ac 20:27 For I have not held back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God. 
44Ac 20:28 So keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock which the Holy Spirit has placed in your care. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he made his own through the blood of his Son. 
44Ac 20:29 I know that after I leave, fierce wolves will come among you, and they will not spare the flock. 
44Ac 20:30 The time will come when some men from your own group will tell lies to lead the believers away after them. 
44Ac 20:31 Watch, then, and remember that with many tears, day and night, I taught every one of you for three years. 
44Ac 20:32 "And now I commend you to the care of God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you the blessings God has for all his people. 
44Ac 20:33 I have not wanted anyone's silver or gold or clothing. 
44Ac 20:34 You yourselves know that I have worked with these hands of mine to provide everything that my companions and I have needed. 
44Ac 20:35 I have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way we must help the weak, remembering the words that the Lord Jesus himself said, 'There is more happiness in giving than in receiving.' " 
44Ac 20:36 When Paul finished, he knelt down with them and prayed. 
44Ac 20:37 They were all crying as they hugged him and kissed him good-bye. 
44Ac 20:38 They were especially sad because he had said that they would never see him again. And so they went with him to the ship. 
44Ac 21:1 We said good-bye to them and left. After sailing straight across, we came to Cos; the next day we reached Rhodes, and from there we went on to Patara. 
44Ac 21:2 There we found a ship that was going to Phoenicia, so we went aboard and sailed away. 
44Ac 21:3 We came to where we could see Cyprus, and then sailed south of it on to Syria. We went ashore at Tyre, where the ship was going to unload its cargo. 
44Ac 21:4 There we found some believers and stayed with them a week. By the power of the Spirit they told Paul not to go to Jerusalem. 
44Ac 21:5 But when our time with them was over, we left and went on our way. All of them, together with their wives and children, went with us out of the city to the beach, where we all knelt and prayed. 
44Ac 21:6 Then we said good-bye to one another, and we went on board the ship while they went back home. 
44Ac 21:7 We continued our voyage, sailing from Tyre to Ptolemais, where we greeted the believers and stayed with them for a day. 
44Ac 21:8 On the following day we left and arrived in Caesarea. There we stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven men who had been chosen as helpers in Jerusalem. 
44Ac 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters who proclaimed God's message. 
44Ac 21:10 We had been there for several days when a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea. 
44Ac 21:11 He came to us, took Paul's belt, tied up his own feet and hands with it, and said, "This is what the Holy Spirit says£º The owner of this belt will be tied up in this way by the Jews in Jerusalem, and they will hand him over to the Gentiles." 
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, we and the others there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem. 
44Ac 21:13 But he answered, "What are you doing, crying like this and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die there for the sake of the Lord Jesus." 
44Ac 21:14 We could not convince him, so we gave up and said, "May the Lord's will be done." 
44Ac 21:15 After spending some time there, we got our things ready and left for Jerusalem. 
44Ac 21:16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us and took us to the house of the man we were going to stay with - Mnason, from Cyprus, who had been a believer since the early days. 
44Ac 21:17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the believers welcomed us warmly. 
44Ac 21:18 The next day Paul went with us to see James; and all the church elders were present. 
44Ac 21:19 Paul greeted them and gave a complete report of everything that God had done among the Gentiles through his work. 
44Ac 21:20 After hearing him, they all praised God. Then they said, "Brother Paul, you can see how many thousands of Jews have become believers, and how devoted they all are to the Law. 
44Ac 21:21 They have been told that you have been teaching all the Jews who live in Gentile countries to abandon the Law of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or follow the Jewish customs. 
44Ac 21:22 They are sure to hear that you have arrived. What should be done, then? 
44Ac 21:23 This is what we want you to do. There are four men here who have taken a vow. 
44Ac 21:24 Go along with them and join them in the ceremony of purification and pay their expenses; then they will be able to shave their heads. In this way everyone will know that there is no truth in any of the things that they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in accordance with the Law of Moses. 
44Ac 21:25 But as for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent them a letter telling them we decided that they must not eat any food that has been offered to idols, or any blood, or any animal that has been strangled, and that they must keep themselves from sexual immorality." 
44Ac 21:26 So Paul took the men and the next day performed the ceremony of purification with them. Then he went into the Temple and gave notice of how many days it would be until the end of the period of purification, when a sacrifice would be offered for each one of them. 
44Ac 21:27 But just when the seven days were about to come to an end, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the Temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and grabbed Paul. 
44Ac 21:28 "People of Israel!" they shouted. "Help! This is the man who goes everywhere teaching everyone against the people of Israel, the Law of Moses, and this Temple. And now he has even brought some Gentiles into the Temple and defiled this holy place!" 
44Ac 21:29 (They said this because they had seen Trophimus from Ephesus with Paul in the city, and they thought that Paul had taken him into the Temple.) 
44Ac 21:30 Confusion spread through the whole city, and the people all ran together, grabbed Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple. At once the Temple doors were closed. 
44Ac 21:31 The mob was trying to kill Paul, when a report was sent up to the commander of the Roman troops that all of Jerusalem was rioting. 
44Ac 21:32 At once the commander took some officers and soldiers and rushed down to the crowd. When the people saw him with the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
44Ac 21:33 The commander went over to Paul, arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked, "Who is this man, and what has he done?" 
44Ac 21:34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing, others something else. There was such confusion that the commander could not find out exactly what had happened, so he ordered his men to take Paul up into the fort. 
44Ac 21:35 They got as far as the steps with him, and then the soldiers had to carry him because the mob was so wild. 
44Ac 21:36 They were all coming after him and screaming, "Kill him!" 
44Ac 21:37 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the fort, he spoke to the commander£º "May I say something to you?" "You speak Greek, do you?" the commander asked. 
44Ac 21:38 "Then you are not that Egyptian fellow who some time ago started a revolution and led four thousand armed terrorists out into the desert?" 
44Ac 21:39 Paul answered, "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city. Please let me speak to the people." 
44Ac 21:40 The commander gave him permission, so Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand for the people to be silent. When they were quiet, Paul spoke to them in Hebrew£º 
44Ac 22:1 "My fellow Jews, listen to me as I make my defense before you!" 
44Ac 22:2 When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even quieter; and Paul went on£º 
44Ac 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up here in Jerusalem as a student of Gamaliel. I received strict instruction in the Law of our ancestors and was just as dedicated to God as are all of you who are here today. 
44Ac 22:4 I persecuted to the death the people who followed this Way. I arrested men and women and threw them into prison. 
44Ac 22:5 The High Priest and the whole Council can prove that I am telling the truth. I received from them letters written to fellow Jews in Damascus, so I went there to arrest these people and bring them back in chains to Jerusalem to be punished. 
44Ac 22:6 "As I was traveling and coming near Damascus, about midday a bright light from the sky flashed suddenly around me. 
44Ac 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul! Why do you persecute me?' 
44Ac 22:8 'Who are you, Lord?' I asked. 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute,' he said to me. 
44Ac 22:9 The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 
44Ac 22:10 I asked, 'What shall I do, Lord?' and the Lord said to me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything that God has determined for you to do.' 
44Ac 22:11 I was blind because of the bright light, and so my companions took me by the hand and led me into Damascus. 
44Ac 22:12 "In that city was a man named Ananias, a religious man who obeyed our Law and was highly respected by all the Jews living there. 
44Ac 22:13 He came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, see again!' At that very moment I saw again and looked at him. 
44Ac 22:14 He said, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see his righteous Servant, and to hear him speaking with his own voice. 
44Ac 22:15 For you will be a witness for him to tell everyone what you have seen and heard. 
44Ac 22:16 And now, why wait any longer? Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him.' 
44Ac 22:17 "I went back to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the Temple, I had a vision, 
44Ac 22:18 in which I saw the Lord, as he said to me, 'Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your witness about me.' 
44Ac 22:19 'Lord,' I answered, 'they know very well that I went to the synagogues and arrested and beat those who believe in you. 
44Ac 22:20 And when your witness Stephen was put to death, I myself was there, approving of his murder and taking care of the cloaks of his murderers.' 
44Ac 22:21 'Go,' the Lord said to me, 'for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' " 
44Ac 22:22 The people listened to Paul until he said this; but then they started shouting at the top of their voices, "Away with him! Kill him! He's not fit to live!" 
44Ac 22:23 They were screaming, waving their clothes, and throwing dust up in the air. 
44Ac 22:24 The Roman commander ordered his men to take Paul into the fort, and he told them to whip him in order to find out why the Jews were screaming like this against him. 
44Ac 22:25 But when they had tied him up to be whipped, Paul said to the officer standing there, "Is it lawful for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried for any crime?" 
44Ac 22:26 When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked him, "What are you doing? That man is a Roman citizen!" 
44Ac 22:27 So the commander went to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," answered Paul. 
44Ac 22:28 The commander said, "I became one by paying a large amount of money." "But I am one by birth," Paul answered. 
44Ac 22:29 At once the men who were going to question Paul drew back from him; and the commander was frightened when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains. 
44Ac 22:30 The commander wanted to find out for sure what the Jews were accusing Paul of; so the next day he had Paul's chains taken off and ordered the chief priests and the whole Council to meet. Then he took Paul and made him stand before them. 
44Ac 23:1 Paul looked straight at the Council and said, "My fellow Israelites! My conscience is perfectly clear about the way in which I have lived before God to this very day." 
44Ac 23:2 The High Priest Ananias ordered those who were standing close to Paul to strike him on the mouth. 
44Ac 23:3 Paul said to him, "God will certainly strike you - you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the Law, yet you break the Law by ordering them to strike me!" 
44Ac 23:4 The men close to Paul said to him, "You are insulting God's High Priest!" 
44Ac 23:5 Paul answered, "My fellow Israelites, I did not know that he was the High Priest. The scripture says, 'You must not speak evil of the ruler of your people.' " 
44Ac 23:6 When Paul saw that some of the group were Sadducees and the others were Pharisees, he called out in the Council, "Fellow Israelites! I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees. I am on trial here because of the hope I have that the dead will rise to life!" 
44Ac 23:7 As soon as he said this, the Pharisees and Sadducees started to quarrel, and the group was divided. 
44Ac 23:8 (For the Sadducees say that people will not rise from death and that there are no angels or spirits; but the Pharisees believe in all three.) 
44Ac 23:9 The shouting became louder, and some of the teachers of the Law who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly£º "We cannot find a thing wrong with this man! Perhaps a spirit or an angel really did speak to him!" 
44Ac 23:10 The argument became so violent that the commander was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces. So he ordered his soldiers to go down into the group, get Paul away from them, and take him into the fort. 
44Ac 23:11 That night the Lord stood by Paul and said, "Don't be afraid! You have given your witness for me here in Jerusalem, and you must also do the same in Rome." 
44Ac 23:12 The next morning some Jews met together and made a plan. They took a vow that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed Paul. 
44Ac 23:13 There were more than forty who planned this together. 
44Ac 23:14 Then they went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn vow together not to eat a thing until we have killed Paul. 
44Ac 23:15 Now then, you and the Council send word to the Roman commander to bring Paul down to you, pretending that you want to get more accurate information about him. But we will be ready to kill him before he ever gets here." 
44Ac 23:16 But the son of Paul's sister heard about the plot; so he went to the fort and told Paul. 
44Ac 23:17 Then Paul called one of the officers and said to him, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him." 
44Ac 23:18 The officer took him, led him to the commander, and said, "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to say to you." 
44Ac 23:19 The commander took him by the hand, led him off by himself, and asked him, "What do you have to tell me?" 
44Ac 23:20 He said, "The Jewish authorities have agreed to ask you tomorrow to take Paul down to the Council, pretending that the Council wants to get more accurate information about him. 
44Ac 23:21 But don't listen to them, because there are more than forty men who will be hiding and waiting for him. They have taken a vow not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are now ready to do it and are waiting for your decision." 
44Ac 23:22 The commander said, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me." And he sent the young man away. 
44Ac 23:23 Then the commander called two of his officers and said, "Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, together with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, and be ready to leave by nine o'clock tonight. 
44Ac 23:24 Provide some horses for Paul to ride and get him safely through to Governor Felix." 
44Ac 23:25 Then the commander wrote a letter that went like this£º 
44Ac 23:26 "Claudius Lysias to His Excellency, Governor Felix£º Greetings. 
44Ac 23:27 The Jews seized this man and were about to kill him. I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and rescued him. 
44Ac 23:28 I wanted to know what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their Council. 
44Ac 23:29 I found out that he had not done a thing for which he deserved to die or be put in prison; the accusation against him had to do with questions about their own law. 
44Ac 23:30 And when I was informed that there was a plot against him, at once I decided to send him to you. I have told his accusers to make their charges against him before you." 
44Ac 23:31 The soldiers carried out their orders. They got Paul and took him that night as far as Antipatris. 
44Ac 23:32 The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fort and left the horsemen to go on with him. 
44Ac 23:33 They took him to Caesarea, delivered the letter to the governor, and turned Paul over to him. 
44Ac 23:34 The governor read the letter and asked Paul what province he was from. When he found out that he was from Cilicia, 
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will hear you when your accusers arrive." Then he gave orders for Paul to be kept under guard in the governor's headquarters. 
44Ac 24:1 Five days later the High Priest Ananias went to Caesarea with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They appeared before Governor Felix and made their charges against Paul. 
44Ac 24:2 Then Paul was called in, and Tertullus began to make his accusation, as follows£º "Your Excellency! Your wise leadership has brought us a long period of peace, and many necessary reforms are being made for the good of our country. 
44Ac 24:3 We welcome this everywhere and at all times, and we are deeply grateful to you. 
44Ac 24:4 I do not want to take up too much of your time, however, so I beg you to be kind and listen to our brief account. 
44Ac 24:5 We found this man to be a dangerous nuisance; he starts riots among Jews all over the world and is a leader of the party of the Nazarenes. 
44Ac 24:6 He also tried to defile the Temple, and we arrested him. 
44Ac 24:7 OMITTED TEXT
44Ac 24:8 If you question this man, you yourself will be able to learn from him all the things that we are accusing him of." 
44Ac 24:9 The Jews joined in the accusation and said that all this was true. 
44Ac 24:10 The governor then motioned to Paul to speak, and Paul said, "I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, and so I am happy to defend myself before you. 
44Ac 24:11 As you can find out for yourself, it was no more than twelve days ago that I went to Jerusalem to worship. 
44Ac 24:12 The Jews did not find me arguing with anyone in the Temple, nor did they find me stirring up the people, either in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 
44Ac 24:13 Nor can they give you proof of the accusations they now bring against me. 
44Ac 24:14 I do admit this to you£º I worship the God of our ancestors by following that Way which they say is false. But I also believe in everything written in the Law of Moses and the books of the prophets. 
44Ac 24:15 I have the same hope in God that these themselves have, namely, that all people, both the good and the bad, will rise from death. 
44Ac 24:16 And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and people. 
44Ac 24:17 "After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I went there to take some money to my own people and to offer sacrifices. 
44Ac 24:18 It was while I was doing this that they found me in the Temple after I had completed the ceremony of purification. There was no crowd with me and no disorder. 
44Ac 24:19 But some Jews from the province of Asia were there; they themselves ought to come before you and make their accusations if they have anything against me. 
44Ac 24:20 Or let these who are here tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the Council - 
44Ac 24:21 except for the one thing I called out when I stood before them£º 'I am being tried by you today for believing that the dead will rise to life.' " 
44Ac 24:22 Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, brought the hearing to a close. "When the commander Lysias arrives," he told them, "I will decide your case." 
44Ac 24:23 He ordered the officer in charge of Paul to keep him under guard, but to give him some freedom and allow his friends to provide for his needs. 
44Ac 24:24 After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he talked about faith in Christ Jesus. 
44Ac 24:25 But as Paul went on discussing about goodness, self-control, and the coming Day of Judgment, Felix was afraid and said, "You may leave now. I will call you again when I get the chance." 
44Ac 24:26 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him some money; and for this reason he would call for him often and talk with him. 
44Ac 24:27 After two years had passed, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix as governor. Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jews so he left Paul in prison. 
44Ac 25:1 Three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem, 
44Ac 25:2 where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders brought their charges against Paul. They begged Festus 
44Ac 25:3 to do them the favor of having Paul come to Jerusalem, for they had made a plot to kill him on the way. 
44Ac 25:4 Festus answered, "Paul is being kept a prisoner in Caesarea, and I myself will be going back there soon. 
44Ac 25:5 Let your leaders go to Caesarea with me and accuse the man if he has done anything wrong." 
44Ac 25:6 Festus spent another eight or ten days with them and then went to Caesarea. On the next day he sat down in the judgment court and ordered Paul to be brought in. 
44Ac 25:7 When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come from Jerusalem stood around him and started making many serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove. 
44Ac 25:8 But Paul defended himself£º "I have done nothing wrong against the Law of the Jews or against the Temple or against the Roman Emperor." 
44Ac 25:9 But Festus wanted to gain favor with the Jews, so he asked Paul, "Would you be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?" 
44Ac 25:10 Paul said, "I am standing before the Emperor's own judgment court, where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you yourself well know. 
44Ac 25:11 If I have broken the law and done something for which I deserve the death penalty, I do not ask to escape it. But if there is no truth in the charges they bring against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to the Emperor." 
44Ac 25:12 Then Festus, after conferring with his advisers, answered, "You have appealed to the Emperor, so to the Emperor you will go." 
44Ac 25:13 Some time later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay a visit of welcome to Festus. 
44Ac 25:14 After they had been there several days, Festus explained Paul's situation to the king£º "There is a man here who was left a prisoner by Felix; 
44Ac 25:15 and when I went to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priests and elders brought charges against him and asked me to condemn him. 
44Ac 25:16 But I told them that we Romans are not in the habit of handing over any who are accused of a crime before they have met their accusers face-to-face and have had the chance of defending themselves against the accusation. 
44Ac 25:17 When they came here, then, I lost no time, but on the very next day I sat in the judgment court and ordered the man to be brought in. 
44Ac 25:18 His opponents stood up, but they did not accuse him of any of the evil crimes that I thought they would. 
44Ac 25:19 All they had were some arguments with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus, who has died; but Paul claims that he is alive. 
44Ac 25:20 I was undecided about how I could get information on these matters, so I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges. 
44Ac 25:21 But Paul appealed; he asked to be kept under guard and to let the Emperor decide his case. So I gave orders for him to be kept under guard until I could send him to the Emperor." 
44Ac 25:22 Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." "You will hear him tomorrow," Festus answered. 
44Ac 25:23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and ceremony and entered the audience hall with the military chiefs and the leading men of the city. Festus gave the order, and Paul was brought in. 
44Ac 25:24 Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are here with us£º You see this man against whom all the Jewish people, both here and in Jerusalem, have brought complaints to me. They scream that he should not live any longer. 
44Ac 25:25 But I could not find that he had done anything for which he deserved the death sentence. And since he himself made an appeal to the Emperor, I have decided to send him. 
44Ac 25:26 But I have nothing definite about him to write to the Emperor. So I have brought him here before you - and especially before you, King Agrippa! - so that, after investigating his case, I may have something to write. 
44Ac 25:27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him." 
44Ac 26:1 Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak on your own behalf." Paul stretched out his hand and defended himself as follows£º 
44Ac 26:2 "King Agrippa! I consider myself fortunate that today I am to defend myself before you from all the things these Jews accuse me of, 
44Ac 26:3 particularly since you know so well all the Jewish customs and disputes. I ask you, then, to listen to me with patience. 
44Ac 26:4 "All the Jews know how I have lived ever since I was young. They know how I have spent my whole life, at first in my own country and then in Jerusalem. 
44Ac 26:5 They have always known, if they are willing to testify, that from the very first I have lived as a member of the strictest party of our religion, the Pharisees. 
44Ac 26:6 And now I stand here to be tried because of the hope I have in the promise that God made to our ancestors - 
44Ac 26:7 the very thing that the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive, as they worship God day and night. And it is because of this hope, Your Majesty, that I am being accused by these Jews! 
44Ac 26:8 Why do you who are here find it impossible to believe that God raises the dead? 
44Ac 26:9 "I myself thought that I should do everything I could against the cause of Jesus of Nazareth. 
44Ac 26:10 That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the chief priests and put many of God's people in prison; and when they were sentenced to death, I also voted against them. 
44Ac 26:11 Many times I had them punished in the synagogues and tried to make them deny their faith. I was so furious with them that I even went to foreign cities to persecute them. 
44Ac 26:12 "It was for this purpose that I went to Damascus with authority and orders from the chief priests. 
44Ac 26:13 It was on the road at midday, Your Majesty, that I saw a light much brighter than the sun, coming from the sky and shining around me and the men traveling with me. 
44Ac 26:14 All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul! Why are you persecuting me? You are hurting yourself by hitting back, like an ox kicking against its owner's stick.' 
44Ac 26:15 'Who are you, Lord?' I asked. And the Lord answered, 'I am Jesus, whom you persecute. 
44Ac 26:16 But get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant. You are to tell others what you have seen of me today and what I will show you in the future. 
44Ac 26:17 I will rescue you from the people of Israel and from the Gentiles to whom I will send you. 
44Ac 26:18 You are to open their eyes and turn them from the darkness to the light and from the power of Satan to God, so that through their faith in me they will have their sins forgiven and receive their place among God's chosen people.' 
44Ac 26:19 "And so, King Agrippa, I did not disobey the vision I had from heaven. 
44Ac 26:20 First in Damascus and in Jerusalem and then in the whole country of Israel and among the Gentiles, I preached that they must repent of their sins and turn to God and do the things that would show they had repented. 
44Ac 26:21 It was for this reason that these Jews seized me while I was in the Temple, and they tried to kill me. 
44Ac 26:22 But to this very day I have been helped by God, and so I stand here giving my witness to all, to small and great alike. What I say is the very same thing which the prophets and Moses said was going to happen£º 
44Ac 26:23 that the Messiah must suffer and be the first one to rise from death, to announce the light of salvation to the Jews and to the Gentiles." 
44Ac 26:24 As Paul defended himself in this way, Festus shouted at him, "You are mad, Paul! Your great learning is driving you mad!" 
44Ac 26:25 Paul answered, "I am not mad, Your Excellency! I am speaking the sober truth. 
44Ac 26:26 King Agrippa! I can speak to you with all boldness, because you know about these things. I am sure that you have taken notice of every one of them, for this thing has not happened hidden away in a corner. 
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do!" 
44Ac 26:28 Agrippa said to Paul, "In this short time do you think you will make me a Christian?" 
44Ac 26:29 "Whether a short time or a long time," Paul answered, "my prayer to God is that you and all the rest of you who are listening to me today might become what I am - except, of course, for these chains!" 
44Ac 26:30 Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others got up, 
44Ac 26:31 and after leaving they said to each other, "This man has not done anything for which he should die or be put in prison." 
44Ac 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been released if he had not appealed to the Emperor." 
44Ac 27:1 When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to Julius, an officer in the Roman army regiment called "The Emperor's Regiment." 
44Ac 27:2 We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium, which was ready to leave for the seaports of the province of Asia, and we sailed away. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. 
44Ac 27:3 The next day we arrived at Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul and allowed him to go and see his friends, to be given what he needed. 
44Ac 27:4 We went on from there, and because the winds were blowing against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of the island of Cyprus. 
44Ac 27:5 We crossed over the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and came to Myra in Lycia. 
44Ac 27:6 There the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail for Italy, so he put us aboard. 
44Ac 27:7 We sailed slowly for several days and with great difficulty finally arrived off the town of Cnidus. The wind would not let us go any farther in that direction, so we sailed down the sheltered side of the island of Crete, passing by Cape Salmone. 
44Ac 27:8 We kept close to the coast and with great difficulty came to a place called Safe Harbors, not far from the town of Lasea. 
44Ac 27:9 We spent a long time there, until it became dangerous to continue the voyage, for by now the Day of Atonement was already past. So Paul gave them this advice£º 
44Ac 27:10 "Men, I see that our voyage from here on will be dangerous; there will be great damage to the cargo and to the ship, and loss of life as well." 
44Ac 27:11 But the army officer was convinced by what the captain and the owner of the ship said, and not by what Paul said. 
44Ac 27:12 The harbor was not a good one to spend the winter in; so almost everyone was in favor of putting out to sea and trying to reach Phoenix, if possible, in order to spend the winter there. Phoenix is a harbor in Crete that faces southwest and northwest. 
44Ac 27:13 A soft wind from the south began to blow, and the men thought that they could carry out their plan, so they pulled up the anchor and sailed as close as possible along the coast of Crete. 
44Ac 27:14 But soon a very strong wind - the one called "Northeaster" - blew down from the island. 
44Ac 27:15 It hit the ship, and since it was impossible to keep the ship headed into the wind, we gave up trying and let it be carried along by the wind. 
44Ac 27:16 We got some shelter when we passed to the south of the little island of Cauda. There, with some difficulty we managed to make the ship's boat secure. 
44Ac 27:17 They pulled it aboard and then fastened some ropes tight around the ship. They were afraid that they might run into the sandbanks off the coast of Libya, so they lowered the sail and let the ship be carried by the wind. 
44Ac 27:18 The violent storm continued, so on the next day they began to throw some of the ship's cargo overboard, 
44Ac 27:19 and on the following day they threw part of the ship's equipment overboard. 
44Ac 27:20 For many days we could not see the sun or the stars, and the wind kept on blowing very hard. We finally gave up all hope of being saved. 
44Ac 27:21 After everyone had gone a long time without food, Paul stood before them and said, "You should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete; then we would have avoided all this damage and loss. 
44Ac 27:22 But now I beg you, take courage! Not one of you will lose your life; only the ship will be lost. 
44Ac 27:23 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship came to me 
44Ac 27:24 and said, 'Don't be afraid, Paul! You must stand before the Emperor. And God in his goodness to you has spared the lives of all those who are sailing with you.' 
44Ac 27:25 So take courage, men! For I trust in God that it will be just as I was told. 
44Ac 27:26 But we will be driven ashore on some island." 
44Ac 27:27 It was the fourteenth night, and we were being driven in the Mediterranean by the storm. About midnight the sailors suspected that we were getting close to land. 
44Ac 27:28 So they dropped a line with a weight tied to it and found that the water was one hundred and twenty feet deep; a little later they did the same and found that it was ninety feet deep. 
44Ac 27:29 They were afraid that the ship would go on the rocks, so they lowered four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight. 
44Ac 27:30 Then the sailors tried to escape from the ship; they lowered the boat into the water and pretended that they were going to put out some anchors from the front of the ship. 
44Ac 27:31 But Paul said to the army officer and soldiers, "If the sailors don't stay on board, you have no hope of being saved." 
44Ac 27:32 So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the boat and let it go. 
44Ac 27:33 Just before dawn, Paul begged them all to eat some food£º "You have been waiting for fourteen days now, and all this time you have not eaten a thing. 
44Ac 27:34 I beg you, then, eat some food; you need it in order to survive. Not even a hair of your heads will be lost." 
44Ac 27:35 After saying this, Paul took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, broke it, and began to eat. 
44Ac 27:36 They took courage, and every one of them also ate some food. 
44Ac 27:37 There was a total of 276 of us on board. 
44Ac 27:38 After everyone had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing all the wheat into the sea. 
44Ac 27:39 When day came, the sailors did not recognize the coast, but they noticed a bay with a beach and decided that, if possible, they would run the ship aground there. 
44Ac 27:40 So they cut off the anchors and let them sink in the sea, and at the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars. Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship so that the wind would blow the ship forward, and we headed for shore. 
44Ac 27:41 But the ship hit a sandbank and went aground; the front part of the ship got stuck and could not move, while the back part was being broken to pieces by the violence of the waves. 
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers made a plan to kill all the prisoners, in order to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping. 
44Ac 27:43 But the army officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped them from doing this. Instead, he ordered everyone who could swim to jump overboard first and swim ashore; 
44Ac 27:44 the rest were to follow, holding on to the planks or to some broken pieces of the ship. And this was how we all got safely ashore. 
44Ac 28:1 When we were safely ashore, we learned that the island was called Malta. 
44Ac 28:2 The natives there were very friendly to us. It had started to rain and was cold, so they built a fire and made us all welcome. 
44Ac 28:3 Paul gathered up a bundle of sticks and was putting them on the fire when a snake came out on account of the heat and fastened itself to his hand. 
44Ac 28:4 The natives saw the snake hanging on Paul's hand and said to one another, "This man must be a murderer, but Fate will not let him live, even though he escaped from the sea." 
44Ac 28:5 But Paul shook the snake off into the fire without being harmed at all. 
44Ac 28:6 They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after waiting for a long time and not seeing anything unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and said, "He is a god!" 
44Ac 28:7 Not far from that place were some fields that belonged to Publius, the chief of the island. He welcomed us kindly and for three days we were his guests. 
44Ac 28:8 Publius' father was in bed, sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went into his room, prayed, placed his hands on him, and healed him. 
44Ac 28:9 When this happened, all the other sick people on the island came and were healed. 
44Ac 28:10 They gave us many gifts, and when we sailed, they put on board what we needed for the voyage. 
44Ac 28:11 After three months we sailed away on a ship from Alexandria, called "The Twin Gods," which had spent the winter in the island. 
44Ac 28:12 We arrived in the city of Syracuse and stayed there for three days. 
44Ac 28:13 From there we sailed on and arrived in the city of Rhegium. The next day a wind began to blow from the south, and in two days we came to the town of Puteoli. 
44Ac 28:14 We found some believers there who asked us to stay with them a week. And so we came to Rome. 
44Ac 28:15 The believers in Rome heard about us and came as far as the towns of Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and was greatly encouraged. 
44Ac 28:16 When we arrived in Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier guarding him. 
44Ac 28:17 After three days Paul called the local Jewish leaders to a meeting. When they had gathered, he said to them, "My fellow Israelites, even though I did nothing against our people or the customs that we received from our ancestors, I was made a prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. 
44Ac 28:18 After questioning me, the Romans wanted to release me, because they found that I had done nothing for which I deserved to die. 
44Ac 28:19 But when the Jews opposed this, I was forced to appeal to the Emperor, even though I had no accusation to make against my own people. 
44Ac 28:20 That is why I asked to see you and talk with you. As a matter of fact, I am bound in chains like this for the sake of him for whom the people of Israel hope." 
44Ac 28:21 They said to him, "We have not received any letters from Judea about you, nor have any of our people come from there with any news or anything bad to say about you. 
44Ac 28:22 But we would like to hear your ideas, because we know that everywhere people speak against this party to which you belong." 
44Ac 28:23 So they set a date with Paul, and a large number of them came that day to the place where Paul was staying. From morning till night he explained to them his message about the Kingdom of God, and he tried to convince them about Jesus by quoting from the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets. 
44Ac 28:24 Some of them were convinced by his words, but others would not believe. 
44Ac 28:25 So they left, disagreeing among themselves, after Paul had said this one thing£º "How well the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors! 
44Ac 28:26 For he said, 'Go and say to this people£º You will listen and listen, but not understand; you will look and look, but not see, 
44Ac 28:27 because this people's minds are dull, and they have stopped up their ears and closed their eyes. Otherwise, their eyes would see, their ears would hear, their minds would understand, and they would turn to me, says God, and I would heal them.' " 
44Ac 28:28 And Paul concluded£º "You are to know, then, that God's message of salvation has been sent to the Gentiles. They will listen!" 
44Ac 28:29 OMITTED TEXT
44Ac 28:30 For two years Paul lived in a place he rented for himself, and there he welcomed all who came to see him. 
44Ac 28:31 He preached about the Kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking with all boldness and freedom.

45Rm 1:1 From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus and an apostle chosen and called by God to preach his Good News. 
45Rm 1:2 The Good News was promised long ago by God through his prophets, as written in the Holy Scriptures. 
45Rm 1:3 It is about his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ£º as to his humanity, he was born a descendant of David; 
45Rm 1:4 as to his divine holiness, he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being raised from death. 
45Rm 1:5 Through him God gave me the privilege of being an apostle for the sake of Christ, in order to lead people of all nations to believe and obey. 
45Rm 1:6 This also includes you who are in Rome, whom God has called to belong to Jesus Christ. 
45Rm 1:7 And so I write to all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his own people£º May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
45Rm 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the whole world is hearing about your faith. 
45Rm 1:9 God is my witness that what I say is true - the God whom I serve with all my heart by preaching the Good News about his Son. God knows that I remember you 
45Rm 1:10 every time I pray. I ask that God in his good will may at last make it possible for me to visit you now. 
45Rm 1:11 For I want very much to see you, in order to share a spiritual blessing with you to make you strong. 
45Rm 1:12 What I mean is that both you and I will be helped at the same time, you by my faith and I by yours. 
45Rm 1:13 You must remember, my friends, that many times I have planned to visit you, but something has always kept me from doing so. I want to win converts among you also, as I have among other Gentiles. 
45Rm 1:14 For I have an obligation to all peoples, to the civilized and to the savage, to the educated and to the ignorant. 
45Rm 1:15 So then, I am eager to preach the Good News to you also who live in Rome. 
45Rm 1:16 I have complete confidence in the gospel; it is God's power to save all who believe, first the Jews and also the Gentiles. 
45Rm 1:17 For the gospel reveals how God puts people right with himself£º it is through faith from beginning to end. As the scripture says, "The person who is put right with God through faith shall live." 
45Rm 1:18 God's anger is revealed from heaven against all the sin and evil of the people whose evil ways prevent the truth from being known. 
45Rm 1:19 God punishes them, because what can be known about God is plain to them, for God himself made it plain. 
45Rm 1:20 Ever since God created the world, his invisible qualities, both his eternal power and his divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made. So those people have no excuse at all! 
45Rm 1:21 They know God, but they do not give him the honor that belongs to him, nor do they thank him. Instead, their thoughts have become complete nonsense, and their empty minds are filled with darkness. 
45Rm 1:22 They say they are wise, but they are fools; 
45Rm 1:23 instead of worshiping the immortal God, they worship images made to look like mortals or birds or animals or reptiles. 
45Rm 1:24 And so God has given those people over to do the filthy things their hearts desire, and they do shameful things with each other. 
45Rm 1:25 They exchange the truth about God for a lie; they worship and serve what God has created instead of the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever! Amen. 
45Rm 1:26 Because they do this, God has given them over to shameful passions. Even the women pervert the natural use of their sex by unnatural acts. 
45Rm 1:27 In the same way the men give up natural sexual relations with women and burn with passion for each other. Men do shameful things with each other, and as a result they bring upon themselves the punishment they deserve for their wrongdoing. 
45Rm 1:28 Because those people refuse to keep in mind the true knowledge about God, he has given them over to corrupted minds, so that they do the things that they should not do. 
45Rm 1:29 They are filled with all kinds of wickedness, evil, greed, and vice; they are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, deceit, and malice. They gossip 
45Rm 1:30 and speak evil of one another; they are hateful to God, insolent, proud, and boastful; they think of more ways to do evil; they disobey their parents; 
45Rm 1:31 they have no conscience; they do not keep their promises, and they show no kindness or pity for others. 
45Rm 1:32 They know that God's law says that people who live in this way deserve death. Yet, not only do they continue to do these very things, but they even approve of others who do them. 
45Rm 2:1 Do you, my friend, pass judgment on others? You have no excuse at all, whoever you are. For when you judge others and then do the same things which they do, you condemn yourself. 
45Rm 2:2 We know that God is right when he judges the people who do such things as these. 
45Rm 2:3 But you, my friend, do those very things for which you pass judgment on others! Do you think you will escape God's judgment? 
45Rm 2:4 Or perhaps you despise his great kindness, tolerance, and patience. Surely you know that God is kind, because he is trying to lead you to repent. 
45Rm 2:5 But you have a hard and stubborn heart, and so you are making your own punishment even greater on the Day when God's anger and righteous judgments will be revealed. 
45Rm 2:6 For God will reward each of us according to what we have done. 
45Rm 2:7 Some people keep on doing good, and seek glory, honor, and immortal life; to them God will give eternal life. 
45Rm 2:8 Other people are selfish and reject what is right, in order to follow what is wrong; on them God will pour out his anger and fury. 
45Rm 2:9 There will be suffering and pain for all those who do what is evil, for the Jews first and also for the Gentiles. 
45Rm 2:10 But God will give glory, honor, and peace to all who do what is good, to the Jews first and also to the Gentiles. 
45Rm 2:11 For God judges everyone by the same standard. 
45Rm 2:12 The Gentiles do not have the Law of Moses; they sin and are lost apart from the Law. The Jews have the Law; they sin and are judged by the Law. 
45Rm 2:13 For it is not by hearing the Law that people are put right with God, but by doing what the Law commands. 
45Rm 2:14 The Gentiles do not have the Law; but whenever they do by instinct what the Law commands, they are their own law, even though they do not have the Law. 
45Rm 2:15 Their conduct shows that what the Law commands is written in their hearts. Their consciences also show that this is true, since their thoughts sometimes accuse them and sometimes defend them. 
45Rm 2:16 And so, according to the Good News I preach, this is how it will be on that Day when God through Jesus Christ will judge the secret thoughts of all. 
45Rm 2:17 What about you? You call yourself a Jew; you depend on the Law and boast about God; 
45Rm 2:18 you know what God wants you to do, and you have learned from the Law to choose what is right; 
45Rm 2:19 you are sure that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in darkness, 
45Rm 2:20 an instructor for the foolish, and a teacher for the ignorant. You are certain that in the Law you have the full content of knowledge and of truth. 
45Rm 2:21 You teach others - why don't you teach yourself ? You preach, "Do not steal" - but do you yourself steal? 
45Rm 2:22 You say, "Do not commit adultery" - but do you commit adultery? You detest idols - but do you rob temples? 
45Rm 2:23 You boast about having God's law - but do you bring shame on God by breaking his law? 
45Rm 2:24 The scripture says, "Because of you Jews, the Gentiles speak evil of God." 
45Rm 2:25 If you obey the Law, your circumcision is of value; but if you disobey the Law, you might as well never have been circumcised. 
45Rm 2:26 If the Gentile, who is not circumcised, obeys the commands of the Law, will not God regard him as though he were circumcised? 
45Rm 2:27 And so you Jews will be condemned by the Gentiles because you break the Law, even though you have it written down and are circumcised; but they obey the Law, even though they are not physically circumcised. 
45Rm 2:28 After all, who is a real Jew, truly circumcised? It is not the man who is a Jew on the outside, whose circumcision is a physical thing. 
45Rm 2:29 Rather, the real Jew is the person who is a Jew on the inside, that is, whose heart has been circumcised, and this is the work of God's Spirit, not of the written Law. Such a person receives praise from God, not from human beings. 
45Rm 3:1 Do the Jews then have any advantage over the Gentiles? Or is there any value in being circumcised? 
45Rm 3:2 Much, indeed, in every way! In the first place, God trusted his message to the Jews. 
45Rm 3:3 But what if some of them were not faithful? Does this mean that God will not be faithful? 
45Rm 3:4 Certainly not! God must be true, even though all human beings are liars. As the scripture says, "You must be shown to be right when you speak; you must win your case when you are being tried." 
45Rm 3:5 But what if our doing wrong serves to show up more clearly God's doing right? Can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us? (This would be the natural question to ask.) 
45Rm 3:6 By no means! If God is not just, how can he judge the world? 
45Rm 3:7 But what if my untruth serves God's glory by making his truth stand out more clearly? Why should I still be condemned as a sinner? 
45Rm 3:8 Why not say, then, "Let us do evil so that good may come"? Some people, indeed, have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing! They will be condemned, as they should be. 
45Rm 3:9 Well then, are we Jews in any better condition than the Gentiles? Not at all! I have already shown that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. 
45Rm 3:10 As the Scriptures say£º "There is no one who is righteous, 
45Rm 3:11 no one who is wise or who worships God. 
45Rm 3:12 All have turned away from God; they have all gone wrong; no one does what is right, not even one. 
45Rm 3:13 Their words are full of deadly deceit; wicked lies roll off their tongues, and dangerous threats, like snake's poison, from their lips; 
45Rm 3:14 their speech is filled with bitter curses. 
45Rm 3:15 They are quick to hurt and kill; 
45Rm 3:16 they leave ruin and destruction wherever they go. 
45Rm 3:17 They have not known the path of peace, 
45Rm 3:18 nor have they learned reverence for God." 
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that everything in the Law applies to those who live under the Law, in order to stop all human excuses and bring the whole world under God's judgment. 
45Rm 3:20 For no one is put right in God's sight by doing what the Law requires; what the Law does is to make us know that we have sinned. 
45Rm 3:21 But now God's way of putting people right with himself has been revealed. It has nothing to do with law, even though the Law of Moses and the prophets gave their witness to it. 
45Rm 3:22 God puts people right through their faith in Jesus Christ. God does this to all who believe in Christ, because there is no difference at all£º 
45Rm 3:23 everyone has sinned and is far away from God's saving presence. 
45Rm 3:24 But by the free gift of God's grace all are put right with him through Christ Jesus, who sets them free. 
45Rm 3:25 God offered him, so that by his blood he should become the means by which people's sins are forgiven through their faith in him. God did this in order to demonstrate that he is righteous. In the past he was patient and overlooked people's sins; but in the present time he deals with their sins, in order to demonstrate his righteousness. 
45Rm 3:26 In this way God shows that he himself is righteous and that he puts right everyone who believes in Jesus. 
45Rm 3:27 What, then, can we boast about? Nothing! And what is the reason for this? Is it that we obey the Law? No, but that we believe. 
45Rm 3:28 For we conclude that a person is put right with God only through faith, and not by doing what the Law commands. 
45Rm 3:29 Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles also? Of course he is. 
45Rm 3:30 God is one, and he will put the Jews right with himself on the basis of their faith, and will put the Gentiles right through their faith. 
45Rm 3:31 Does this mean that by this faith we do away with the Law? No, not at all; instead, we uphold the Law. 
45Rm 4:1 What shall we say, then, of Abraham, the father of our race? What was his experience? 
45Rm 4:2 If he was put right with God by the things he did, he would have something to boast about - but not in God's sight. 
45Rm 4:3 The scripture says, "Abraham believed God, and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous." 
45Rm 4:4 A person who works is paid wages, but they are not regarded as a gift; they are something that has been earned. 
45Rm 4:5 But those who depend on faith, not on deeds, and who believe in the God who declares the guilty to be innocent, it is this faith that God takes into account in order to put them right with himself. 
45Rm 4:6 This is what David meant when he spoke of the happiness of the person whom God accepts as righteous, apart from anything that person does£º 
45Rm 4:7 "Happy are those whose wrongs are forgiven, whose sins are pardoned! 
45Rm 4:8 Happy is the person whose sins the Lord will not keep account of !" 
45Rm 4:9 Does this happiness that David spoke of belong only to those who are circumcised? No indeed! It belongs also to those who are not circumcised. For we have quoted the scripture, "Abraham believed God, and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous." 
45Rm 4:10 When did this take place? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised? It was before, not after. 
45Rm 4:11 He was circumcised later, and his circumcision was a sign to show that because of his faith God had accepted him as righteous before he had been circumcised. And so Abraham is the spiritual father of all who believe in God and are accepted as righteous by him, even though they are not circumcised. 
45Rm 4:12 He is also the father of those who are circumcised, that is, of those who, in addition to being circumcised, also live the same life of faith that our father Abraham lived before he was circumcised. 
45Rm 4:13 When God promised Abraham and his descendants that the world would belong to him, he did so, not because Abraham obeyed the Law, but because he believed and was accepted as righteous by God. 
45Rm 4:14 For if what God promises is to be given to those who obey the Law, then faith means nothing and God's promise is worthless. 
45Rm 4:15 The Law brings down God's anger; but where there is no law, there is no disobeying of the law. 
45Rm 4:16 And so the promise was based on faith, in order that the promise should be guaranteed as God's free gift to all of Abraham's descendants - not just to those who obey the Law, but also to those who believe as Abraham did. For Abraham is the spiritual father of us all; 
45Rm 4:17 as the scripture says, "I have made you father of many nations." So the promise is good in the sight of God, in whom Abraham believed - the God who brings the dead to life and whose command brings into being what did not exist. 
45Rm 4:18 Abraham believed and hoped, even when there was no reason for hoping, and so became "the father of many nations." Just as the scripture says, "Your descendants will be as many as the stars." 
45Rm 4:19 He was then almost one hundred years old; but his faith did not weaken when he thought of his body, which was already practically dead, or of the fact that Sarah could not have children. 
45Rm 4:20 His faith did not leave him, and he did not doubt God's promise; his faith filled him with power, and he gave praise to God. 
45Rm 4:21 He was absolutely sure that God would be able to do what he had promised. 
45Rm 4:22 That is why Abraham, through faith, "was accepted as righteous by God." 
45Rm 4:23 The words "he was accepted as righteous" were not written for him alone. 
45Rm 4:24 They were written also for us who are to be accepted as righteous, who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death. 
45Rm 4:25 Because of our sins he was given over to die, and he was raised to life in order to put us right with God. 
45Rm 5:1 Now that we have been put right with God through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
45Rm 5:2 He has brought us by faith into this experience of God's grace, in which we now live. And so we boast of the hope we have of sharing God's glory! 
45Rm 5:3 We also boast of our troubles, because we know that trouble produces endurance, 
45Rm 5:4 endurance brings God's approval, and his approval creates hope. 
45Rm 5:5 This hope does not disappoint us, for God has poured out his love into our hearts by means of the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to us. 
45Rm 5:6 For when we were still helpless, Christ died for the wicked at the time that God chose. 
45Rm 5:7 It is a difficult thing for someone to die for a righteous person. It may even be that someone might dare to die for a good person. 
45Rm 5:8 But God has shown us how much he loves us - it was while we were still sinners that Christ died for us! 
45Rm 5:9 By his blood we are now put right with God; how much more, then, will we be saved by him from God's anger! 
45Rm 5:10 We were God's enemies, but he made us his friends through the death of his Son. Now that we are God's friends, how much more will we be saved by Christ's life! 
45Rm 5:11 But that is not all; we rejoice because of what God has done through our Lord Jesus Christ, who has now made us God's friends. 
45Rm 5:12 Sin came into the world through one man, and his sin brought death with it. As a result, death has spread to the whole human race because everyone has sinned. 
45Rm 5:13 There was sin in the world before the Law was given; but where there is no law, no account is kept of sins. 
45Rm 5:14 But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, death ruled over all human beings, even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam did when he disobeyed God's command. Adam was a figure of the one who was to come. 
45Rm 5:15 But the two are not the same, because God's free gift is not like Adam's sin. It is true that many people died because of the sin of that one man. But God's grace is much greater, and so is his free gift to so many people through the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ. 
45Rm 5:16 And there is a difference between God's gift and the sin of one man. After the one sin, came the judgment of "Guilty"; but after so many sins, comes the undeserved gift of "Not guilty!" 
45Rm 5:17 It is true that through the sin of one man death began to rule because of that one man. But how much greater is the result of what was done by the one man, Jesus Christ! All who receive God's abundant grace and are freely put right with him will rule in life through Christ. 
45Rm 5:18 So then, as the one sin condemned all people, in the same way the one righteous act sets all people free and gives them life. 
45Rm 5:19 And just as all people were made sinners as the result of the disobedience of one man, in the same way they will all be put right with God as the result of the obedience of the one man. 
45Rm 5:20 Law was introduced in order to increase wrongdoing; but where sin increased, God's grace increased much more. 
45Rm 5:21 So then, just as sin ruled by means of death, so also God's grace rules by means of righteousness, leading us to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
45Rm 6:1 What shall we say, then? Should we continue to live in sin so that God's grace will increase? 
45Rm 6:2 Certainly not! We have died to sin - how then can we go on living in it? 
45Rm 6:3 For surely you know that when we were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, we were baptized into union with his death. 
45Rm 6:4 By our baptism, then, we were buried with him and shared his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from death by the glorious power of the Father, so also we might live a new life. 
45Rm 6:5 For since we have become one with him in dying as he did, in the same way we shall be one with him by being raised to life as he was. 
45Rm 6:6 And we know that our old being has been put to death with Christ on his cross, in order that the power of the sinful self might be destroyed, so that we should no longer be the slaves of sin. 
45Rm 6:7 For when we die, we are set free from the power of sin. 
45Rm 6:8 Since we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
45Rm 6:9 For we know that Christ has been raised from death and will never die again - death will no longer rule over him. 
45Rm 6:10 And so, because he died, sin has no power over him; and now he lives his life in fellowship with God. 
45Rm 6:11 In the same way you are to think of yourselves as dead, so far as sin is concerned, but living in fellowship with God through Christ Jesus. 
45Rm 6:12 Sin must no longer rule in your mortal bodies, so that you obey the desires of your natural self. 
45Rm 6:13 Nor must you surrender any part of yourselves to sin to be used for wicked purposes. Instead, give yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life, and surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes. 
45Rm 6:14 Sin must not be your master; for you do not live under law but under God's grace. 
45Rm 6:15 What, then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law but under God's grace? By no means! 
45Rm 6:16 Surely you know that when you surrender yourselves as slaves to obey someone, you are in fact the slaves of the master you obey - either of sin, which results in death, or of obedience, which results in being put right with God. 
45Rm 6:17 But thanks be to God! For though at one time you were slaves to sin, you have obeyed with all your heart the truths found in the teaching you received. 
45Rm 6:18 You were set free from sin and became the slaves of righteousness. 
45Rm 6:19 (I use everyday language because of the weakness of your natural selves.) At one time you surrendered yourselves entirely as slaves to impurity and wickedness for wicked purposes. In the same way you must now surrender yourselves entirely as slaves of righteousness for holy purposes. 
45Rm 6:20 When you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. 
45Rm 6:21 What did you gain from doing the things that you are now ashamed of ? The result of those things is death! 
45Rm 6:22 But now you have been set free from sin and are the slaves of God. Your gain is a life fully dedicated to him, and the result is eternal life. 
45Rm 6:23 For sin pays its wage - death; but God's free gift is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord. 
45Rm 7:1 Certainly you will understand what I am about to say, my friends, because all of you know about law. The law rules over people only as long as they live. 
45Rm 7:2 A married woman, for example, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives; but if he dies, then she is free from the law that bound her to him. 
45Rm 7:3 So then, if she lives with another man while her husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is legally a free woman and does not commit adultery if she marries another man. 
45Rm 7:4 That is how it is with you, my friends. As far as the Law is concerned, you also have died because you are part of the body of Christ; and now you belong to him who was raised from death in order that we might be useful in the service of God. 
45Rm 7:5 For when we lived according to our human nature, the sinful desires stirred up by the Law were at work in our bodies, and all we did ended in death. 
45Rm 7:6 Now, however, we are free from the Law, because we died to that which once held us prisoners. No longer do we serve in the old way of a written law, but in the new way of the Spirit. 
45Rm 7:7 Shall we say, then, that the Law itself is sinful? Of course not! But it was the Law that made me know what sin is. If the Law had not said, "Do not desire what belongs to someone else," I would not have known such a desire. 
45Rm 7:8 But by means of that commandment sin found its chance to stir up all kinds of selfish desires in me. Apart from law, sin is a dead thing. 
45Rm 7:9 I myself was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life, 
45Rm 7:10 and I died. And the commandment which was meant to bring life, in my case brought death. 
45Rm 7:11 Sin found its chance, and by means of the commandment it deceived me and killed me. 
45Rm 7:12 So then, the Law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy, right, and good. 
45Rm 7:13 But does this mean that what is good caused my death? By no means! It was sin that did it; by using what is good, sin brought death to me, in order that its true nature as sin might be revealed. And so, by means of the commandment sin is shown to be even more terribly sinful. 
45Rm 7:14 We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am a mortal, sold as a slave to sin. 
45Rm 7:15 I do not understand what I do; for I don't do what I would like to do, but instead I do what I hate. 
45Rm 7:16 Since what I do is what I don't want to do, this shows that I agree that the Law is right. 
45Rm 7:17 So I am not really the one who does this thing; rather it is the sin that lives in me. 
45Rm 7:18 I know that good does not live in me - that is, in my human nature. For even though the desire to do good is in me, I am not able to do it. 
45Rm 7:19 I don't do the good I want to do; instead, I do the evil that I do not want to do. 
45Rm 7:20 If I do what I don't want to do, this means that I am no longer the one who does it; instead, it is the sin that lives in me. 
45Rm 7:21 So I find that this law is at work£º when I want to do what is good, what is evil is the only choice I have. 
45Rm 7:22 My inner being delights in the law of God. 
45Rm 7:23 But I see a different law at work in my body - a law that fights against the law which my mind approves of. It makes me a prisoner to the law of sin which is at work in my body. 
45Rm 7:24 What an unhappy man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is taking me to death? 
45Rm 7:25 Thanks be to God, who does this through our Lord Jesus Christ! This, then, is my condition£º on my own I can serve God's law only with my mind, while my human nature serves the law of sin. 
45Rm 8:1 There is no condemnation now for those who live in union with Christ Jesus. 
45Rm 8:2 For the law of the Spirit, which brings us life in union with Christ Jesus, has set me free from the law of sin and death. 
45Rm 8:3 What the Law could not do, because human nature was weak, God did. He condemned sin in human nature by sending his own Son, who came with a nature like our sinful nature, to do away with sin. 
45Rm 8:4 God did this so that the righteous demands of the Law might be fully satisfied in us who live according to the Spirit, and not according to human nature. 
45Rm 8:5 Those who live as their human nature tells them to, have their minds controlled by what human nature wants. Those who live as the Spirit tells them to, have their minds controlled by what the Spirit wants. 
45Rm 8:6 To be controlled by human nature results in death; to be controlled by the Spirit results in life and peace. 
45Rm 8:7 And so people become enemies of God when they are controlled by their human nature; for they do not obey God's law, and in fact they cannot obey it. 
45Rm 8:8 Those who obey their human nature cannot please God. 
45Rm 8:9 But you do not live as your human nature tells you to; instead, you live as the Spirit tells you to - if, in fact, God's Spirit lives in you. Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. 
45Rm 8:10 But if Christ lives in you, the Spirit is life for you because you have been put right with God, even though your bodies are going to die because of sin. 
45Rm 8:11 If the Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from death, lives in you, then he who raised Christ from death will also give life to your mortal bodies by the presence of his Spirit in you. 
45Rm 8:12 So then, my friends, we have an obligation, but it is not to live as our human nature wants us to. 
45Rm 8:13 For if you live according to your human nature, you are going to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death your sinful actions, you will live. 
45Rm 8:14 Those who are led by God's Spirit are God's children. 
45Rm 8:15 For the Spirit that God has given you does not make you slaves and cause you to be afraid; instead, the Spirit makes you God's children, and by the Spirit's power we cry out to God, "Father! my Father!" 
45Rm 8:16 God's Spirit joins himself to our spirits to declare that we are God's children. 
45Rm 8:17 Since we are his children, we will possess the blessings he keeps for his people, and we will also possess with Christ what God has kept for him; for if we share Christ's suffering, we will also share his glory. 
45Rm 8:18 I consider that what we suffer at this present time cannot be compared at all with the glory that is going to be revealed to us. 
45Rm 8:19 All of creation waits with eager longing for God to reveal his children. 
45Rm 8:20 For creation was condemned to lose its purpose, not of its own will, but because God willed it to be so. Yet there was the hope 
45Rm 8:21 that creation itself would one day be set free from its slavery to decay and would share the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
45Rm 8:22 For we know that up to the present time all of creation groans with pain, like the pain of childbirth. 
45Rm 8:23 But it is not just creation alone which groans; we who have the Spirit as the first of God's gifts also groan within ourselves as we wait for God to make us his children and set our whole being free. 
45Rm 8:24 For it was by hope that we were saved; but if we see what we hope for, then it is not really hope. For who of us hopes for something we see? 
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. 
45Rm 8:26 In the same way the Spirit also comes to help us, weak as we are. For we do not know how we ought to pray; the Spirit himself pleads with God for us in groans that words cannot express. 
45Rm 8:27 And God, who sees into our hearts, knows what the thought of the Spirit is; because the Spirit pleads with God on behalf of his people and in accordance with his will. 
45Rm 8:28 We know that in all things God works for good with those who love him, those whom he has called according to his purpose. 
45Rm 8:29 Those whom God had already chosen he also set apart to become like his Son, so that the Son would be the first among many believers. 
45Rm 8:30 And so those whom God set apart, he called; and those he called, he put right with himself, and he shared his glory with them. 
45Rm 8:31 In view of all this, what can we say? If God is for us, who can be against us? 
45Rm 8:32 Certainly not God, who did not even keep back his own Son, but offered him for us all! He gave us his Son - will he not also freely give us all things? 
45Rm 8:33 Who will accuse God's chosen people? God himself declares them not guilty! 
45Rm 8:34 Who, then, will condemn them? Not Christ Jesus, who died, or rather, who was raised to life and is at the right side of God, pleading with him for us! 
45Rm 8:35 Who, then, can separate us from the love of Christ? Can trouble do it, or hardship or persecution or hunger or poverty or danger or death? 
45Rm 8:36 As the scripture says, "For your sake we are in danger of death at all times; we are treated like sheep that are going to be slaughtered." 
45Rm 8:37 No, in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us! 
45Rm 8:38 For I am certain that nothing can separate us from his love£º neither death nor life, neither angels nor other heavenly rulers or powers, neither the present nor the future, 
45Rm 8:39 neither the world above nor the world below - there is nothing in all creation that will ever be able to separate us from the love of God which is ours through Christ Jesus our Lord. 
45Rm 9:1 I am speaking the truth; I belong to Christ and I do not lie. My conscience, ruled by the Holy Spirit, also assures me that I am not lying 
45Rm 9:2 when I say how great is my sorrow, how endless the pain in my heart 
45Rm 9:3 for my people, my own flesh and blood! For their sake I could wish that I myself were under God's curse and separated from Christ. 
45Rm 9:4 They are God's people; he made them his children and revealed his glory to them; he made his covenants with them and gave them the Law; they have the true worship; they have received God's promises; 
45Rm 9:5 they are descended from the famous Hebrew ancestors; and Christ, as a human being, belongs to their race. May God, who rules over all, be praised forever! Amen. 
45Rm 9:6 I am not saying that the promise of God has failed; for not all the people of Israel are the people of God. 
45Rm 9:7 Nor are all of Abraham's descendants the children of God. God said to Abraham, "It is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I promised you." 
45Rm 9:8 This means that the children born in the usual way are not the children of God; instead, the children born as a result of God's promise are regarded as the true descendants. 
45Rm 9:9 For God's promise was made in these words£º "At the right time I will come back, and Sarah will have a son." 
45Rm 9:10 And this is not all. For Rebecca's two sons had the same father, our ancestor Isaac. 
45Rm 9:11 But in order that the choice of one son might be completely the result of God's own purpose, God said to her, "The older will serve the younger." He said this before they were born, before they had done anything either good or bad; 
45Rm 9:12 so God's choice was based on his call, and not on anything they had done. 
45Rm 9:13 As the scripture says, "I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau." 
45Rm 9:14 Shall we say, then, that God is unjust? Not at all. 
45Rm 9:15 For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on anyone I wish; I will take pity on anyone I wish." 
45Rm 9:16 So then, everything depends, not on what we humans want or do, but only on God's mercy. 
45Rm 9:17 For the scripture says to the king of Egypt, "I made you king in order to use you to show my power and to spread my fame over the whole world." 
45Rm 9:18 So then, God has mercy on anyone he wishes, and he makes stubborn anyone he wishes. 
45Rm 9:19 But one of you will say to me, "If this is so, how can God find fault with anyone? Who can resist God's will?" 
45Rm 9:20 But who are you, my friend, to talk back to God? A clay pot does not ask the man who made it, "Why did you make me like this?" 
45Rm 9:21 After all, the man who makes the pots has the right to use the clay as he wishes, and to make two pots from the same lump of clay, one for special occasions and the other for ordinary use. 
45Rm 9:22 And the same is true of what God has done. He wanted to show his anger and to make his power known. But he was very patient in enduring those who were the objects of his anger, who were doomed to destruction. 
45Rm 9:23 And he also wanted to reveal his abundant glory, which was poured out on us who are the objects of his mercy, those of us whom he has prepared to receive his glory. 
45Rm 9:24 For we are the people he called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles. 
45Rm 9:25 This is what he says in the book of Hosea£º "The people who were not mine I will call 'My People.' The nation that I did not love I will call 'My Beloved.' 
45Rm 9:26 And in the very place where they were told, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called the children of the living God." 
45Rm 9:27 And Isaiah exclaims about Israel£º "Even if the people of Israel are as many as the grains of sand by the sea, yet only a few of them will be saved; 
45Rm 9:28 for the Lord will quickly settle his full account with the world." 
45Rm 9:29 It is as Isaiah had said before, "If the Lord Almighty had not left us some descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." 
45Rm 9:30 So we say that the Gentiles, who were not trying to put themselves right with God, were put right with him through faith; 
45Rm 9:31 while God's people, who were seeking a law that would put them right with God, did not find it. 
45Rm 9:32 And why not? Because they did not depend on faith but on what they did. And so they stumbled over the "stumbling stone" 
45Rm 9:33 that the scripture speaks of£º "Look, I place in Zion a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall. But whoever believes in him will not be disappointed." 
45Rm 10:1 My friends, how I wish with all my heart that my own people might be saved! How I pray to God for them! 
45Rm 10:2 I can assure you that they are deeply devoted to God; but their devotion is not based on true knowledge. 
45Rm 10:3 They have not known the way in which God puts people right with himself, and instead, they have tried to set up their own way; and so they did not submit themselves to God's way of putting people right. 
45Rm 10:4 For Christ has brought the Law to an end, so that everyone who believes is put right with God. 
45Rm 10:5 Moses wrote this about being put right with God by obeying the Law£º "Whoever obeys the commands of the Law will live." 
45Rm 10:6 But what the scripture says about being put right with God through faith is this£º "You are not to ask yourself, Who will go up into heaven?" (that is, to bring Christ down). 
45Rm 10:7 "Nor are you to ask, Who will go down into the world below?" (that is, to bring Christ up from death). 
45Rm 10:8 What it says is this£º "God's message is near you, on your lips and in your heart" - that is, the message of faith that we preach. 
45Rm 10:9 If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised him from death, you will be saved. 
45Rm 10:10 For it is by our faith that we are put right with God; it is by our confession that we are saved. 
45Rm 10:11 The scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed." 
45Rm 10:12 This includes everyone, because there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles; God is the same Lord of all and richly blesses all who call to him. 
45Rm 10:13 As the scripture says, "Everyone who calls out to the Lord for help will be saved." 
45Rm 10:14 But how can they call to him for help if they have not believed? And how can they believe if they have not heard the message? And how can they hear if the message is not proclaimed? 
45Rm 10:15 And how can the message be proclaimed if the messengers are not sent out? As the scripture says, "How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news!" 
45Rm 10:16 But not all have accepted the Good News. Isaiah himself said, "Lord, who believed our message?" 
45Rm 10:17 So then, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message comes through preaching Christ. 
45Rm 10:18 But I ask£º Is it true that they did not hear the message? Of course they did - for as the scripture says£º "The sound of their voice went out to all the world; their words reached the ends of the earth." 
45Rm 10:19 Again I ask£º Did the people of Israel not understand? Moses himself is the first one to answer£º "I will use a so-called nation to make my people jealous; and by means of a nation of fools I will make my people angry." 
45Rm 10:20 And Isaiah is even bolder when he says, "I was found by those who were not looking for me; I appeared to those who were not asking for me." 
45Rm 10:21 But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I held out my hands to welcome a disobedient and rebellious people." 
45Rm 11:1 I ask, then£º Did God reject his own people? Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. 
45Rm 11:2 God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the beginning. You know what the scripture says in the passage where Elijah pleads with God against Israel£º 
45Rm 11:3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me." 
45Rm 11:4 What answer did God give him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not worshiped the false god Baal." 
45Rm 11:5 It is the same way now£º there is a small number left of those whom God has chosen because of his grace. 
45Rm 11:6 His choice is based on his grace, not on what they have done. For if God's choice were based on what people do, then his grace would not be real grace. 
45Rm 11:7 What then? The people of Israel did not find what they were looking for. It was only the small group that God chose who found it; the rest grew deaf to God's call. 
45Rm 11:8 As the scripture says, "God made their minds and hearts dull; to this very day they cannot see or hear." 
45Rm 11:9 And David says, "May they be caught and trapped at their feasts; may they fall, may they be punished! 
45Rm 11:10 May their eyes be blinded so that they cannot see; and make them bend under their troubles at all times." 
45Rm 11:11 I ask, then£º When the Jews stumbled, did they fall to their ruin? By no means! Because they sinned, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make the Jews jealous of them. 
45Rm 11:12 The sin of the Jews brought rich blessings to the world, and their spiritual poverty brought rich blessings to the Gentiles. Then, how much greater the blessings will be when the complete number of Jews is included! 
45Rm 11:13 I am speaking now to you Gentiles£º As long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I will take pride in my work. 
45Rm 11:14 Perhaps I can make the people of my own race jealous, and so be able to save some of them. 
45Rm 11:15 For when they were rejected, all other people were changed from God's enemies into his friends. What will it be, then, when they are accepted? It will be life for the dead! 
45Rm 11:16 If the first piece of bread is given to God, then the whole loaf is his also; and if the roots of a tree are offered to God, the branches are his also. 
45Rm 11:17 Some of the branches of the cultivated olive tree have been broken off, and a branch of a wild olive tree has been joined to it. You Gentiles are like that wild olive tree, and now you share the strong spiritual life of the Jews. 
45Rm 11:18 So then, you must not despise those who were broken off like branches. How can you be proud? You are just a branch; you don't support the roots - the roots support you. 
45Rm 11:19 But you will say, "Yes, but the branches were broken off to make room for me." 
45Rm 11:20 That is true. They were broken off because they did not believe, while you remain in place because you do believe. But do not be proud of it; instead, be afraid. 
45Rm 11:21 God did not spare the Jews, who are like natural branches; do you think he will spare you? 
45Rm 11:22 Here we see how kind and how severe God is. He is severe toward those who have fallen, but kind to you - if you continue in his kindness. But if you do not, you too will be broken off. 
45Rm 11:23 And if the Jews abandon their unbelief, they will be put back in the place where they were; for God is able to do that. 
45Rm 11:24 You Gentiles are like the branch of a wild olive tree that is broken off and then, contrary to nature, is joined to a cultivated olive tree. The Jews are like this cultivated tree; and it will be much easier for God to join these broken-off branches to their own tree again. 
45Rm 11:25 There is a secret truth, my friends, which I want you to know, for it will keep you from thinking how wise you are. It is that the stubbornness of the people of Israel is not permanent, but will last only until the complete number of Gentiles comes to God. 
45Rm 11:26 And this is how all Israel will be saved. As the scripture says, "The Savior will come from Zion and remove all wickedness from the descendants of Jacob. 
45Rm 11:27 I will make this covenant with them when I take away their sins." 
45Rm 11:28 Because they reject the Good News, the Jews are God's enemies for the sake of you Gentiles. But because of God's choice, they are his friends because of their ancestors. 
45Rm 11:29 For God does not change his mind about whom he chooses and blesses. 
45Rm 11:30 As for you Gentiles, you disobeyed God in the past; but now you have received God's mercy because the Jews were disobedient. 
45Rm 11:31 In the same way, because of the mercy that you have received, the Jews now disobey God, in order that they also may now receive God's mercy. 
45Rm 11:32 For God has made all people prisoners of disobedience, so that he might show mercy to them all. 
45Rm 11:33 How great are God's riches! How deep are his wisdom and knowledge! Who can explain his decisions? Who can understand his ways? 
45Rm 11:34 As the scripture says, "Who knows the mind of the Lord? Who is able to give him advice? 
45Rm 11:35 Who has ever given him anything, so that he had to pay it back?" 
45Rm 11:36 For all things were created by him, and all things exist through him and for him. To God be the glory forever! Amen. 
45Rm 12:1 So then, my friends, because of God's great mercy to us I appeal to you£º Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer. 
45Rm 12:2 Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God - what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect. 
45Rm 12:3 And because of God's gracious gift to me I say to every one of you£º Do not think of yourself more highly than you should. Instead, be modest in your thinking, and judge yourself according to the amount of faith that God has given you. 
45Rm 12:4 We have many parts in the one body, and all these parts have different functions. 
45Rm 12:5 In the same way, though we are many, we are one body in union with Christ, and we are all joined to each other as different parts of one body. 
45Rm 12:6 So we are to use our different gifts in accordance with the grace that God has given us. If our gift is to speak God's message, we should do it according to the faith that we have; 
45Rm 12:7 if it is to serve, we should serve; if it is to teach, we should teach; 
45Rm 12:8 if it is to encourage others, we should do so. Whoever shares with others should do it generously; whoever has authority should work hard; whoever shows kindness to others should do it cheerfully. 
45Rm 12:9 Love must be completely sincere. Hate what is evil, hold on to what is good. 
45Rm 12:10 Love one another warmly as Christians, and be eager to show respect for one another. 
45Rm 12:11 Work hard and do not be lazy. Serve the Lord with a heart full of devotion. 
45Rm 12:12 Let your hope keep you joyful, be patient in your troubles, and pray at all times. 
45Rm 12:13 Share your belongings with your needy fellow Christians, and open your homes to strangers. 
45Rm 12:14 Ask God to bless those who persecute you - yes, ask him to bless, not to curse. 
45Rm 12:15 Be happy with those who are happy, weep with those who weep. 
45Rm 12:16 Have the same concern for everyone. Do not be proud, but accept humble duties. Do not think of yourselves as wise. 
45Rm 12:17 If someone has done you wrong, do not repay him with a wrong. Try to do what everyone considers to be good. 
45Rm 12:18 Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody. 
45Rm 12:19 Never take revenge, my friends, but instead let God's anger do it. For the scripture says, "I will take revenge, I will pay back, says the Lord." 
45Rm 12:20 Instead, as the scripture says£º "If your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them a drink; for by doing this you will make them burn with shame." 
45Rm 12:21 Do not let evil defeat you; instead, conquer evil with good. 
45Rm 13:1 Everyone must obey state authorities, because no authority exists without God's permission, and the existing authorities have been put there by God. 
45Rm 13:2 Whoever opposes the existing authority opposes what God has ordered; and anyone who does so will bring judgment on himself. 
45Rm 13:3 For rulers are not to be feared by those who do good, but by those who do evil. Would you like to be unafraid of those in authority? Then do what is good, and they will praise you, 
45Rm 13:4 because they are God's servants working for your own good. But if you do evil, then be afraid of them, because their power to punish is real. They are God's servants and carry out God's punishment on those who do evil. 
45Rm 13:5 For this reason you must obey the authorities - not just because of God's punishment, but also as a matter of conscience. 
45Rm 13:6 That is also why you pay taxes, because the authorities are working for God when they fulfill their duties. 
45Rm 13:7 Pay, then, what you owe them; pay them your personal and property taxes, and show respect and honor for them all. 
45Rm 13:8 Be under obligation to no one - the only obligation you have is to love one another. Whoever does this has obeyed the Law. 
45Rm 13:9 The commandments, "Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not desire what belongs to someone else" - all these, and any others besides, are summed up in the one command, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." 
45Rm 13:10 If you love others, you will never do them wrong; to love, then, is to obey the whole Law. 
45Rm 13:11 You must do this, because you know that the time has come for you to wake up from your sleep. For the moment when we will be saved is closer now than it was when we first believed. 
45Rm 13:12 The night is nearly over, day is almost here. Let us stop doing the things that belong to the dark, and let us take up weapons for fighting in the light. 
45Rm 13:13 Let us conduct ourselves properly, as people who live in the light of day - no orgies or drunkenness, no immorality or indecency, no fighting or jealousy. 
45Rm 13:14 But take up the weapons of the Lord Jesus Christ, and stop paying attention to your sinful nature and satisfying its desires. 
45Rm 14:1 Welcome those who are weak in faith, but do not argue with them about their personal opinions. 
45Rm 14:2 Some people's faith allows them to eat anything, but the person who is weak in the faith eats only vegetables. 
45Rm 14:3 The person who will eat anything is not to despise the one who doesn't; while the one who eats only vegetables is not to pass judgment on the one who will eat anything; for God has accepted that person. 
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to judge the servants of someone else? It is their own Master who will decide whether they succeed or fail. And they will succeed, because the Lord is able to make them succeed. 
45Rm 14:5 Some people think that a certain day is more important than other days, while others think that all days are the same. We each should firmly make up our own minds. 
45Rm 14:6 Those who think highly of a certain day do so in honor of the Lord; those who will eat anything do so in honor of the Lord, because they give thanks to God for the food. Those who refuse to eat certain things do so in honor of the Lord, and they give thanks to God. 
45Rm 14:7 We do not live for ourselves only, and we do not die for ourselves only. 
45Rm 14:8 If we live, it is for the Lord that we live, and if we die, it is for the Lord that we die. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. 
45Rm 14:9 For Christ died and rose to life in order to be the Lord of the living and of the dead. 
45Rm 14:10 You then, who eat only vegetables - why do you pass judgment on others? And you who eat anything - why do you despise other believers? All of us will stand before God to be judged by him. 
45Rm 14:11 For the scripture says, "As surely as I am the living God, says the Lord, everyone will kneel before me, and everyone will confess that I am God." 
45Rm 14:12 Every one of us, then, will have to give an account to God. 
45Rm 14:13 So then, let us stop judging one another. Instead, you should decide never to do anything that would make others stumble or fall into sin. 
45Rm 14:14 My union with the Lord Jesus makes me certain that no food is of itself ritually unclean; but if you believe that some food is unclean, then it becomes unclean for you. 
45Rm 14:15 If you hurt others because of something you eat, then you are no longer acting from love. Do not let the food that you eat ruin the person for whom Christ died! 
45Rm 14:16 Do not let what you regard as good get a bad name. 
45Rm 14:17 For God's Kingdom is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of the righteousness, peace, and joy which the Holy Spirit gives. 
45Rm 14:18 And when you serve Christ in this way, you please God and are approved by others. 
45Rm 14:19 So then, we must always aim at those things that bring peace and that help strengthen one another. 
45Rm 14:20 Do not, because of food, destroy what God has done. All foods may be eaten, but it is wrong to eat anything that will cause someone else to fall into sin. 
45Rm 14:21 The right thing to do is to keep from eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that will make other believers fall. 
45Rm 14:22 Keep what you believe about this matter, then, between yourself and God. Happy are those who do not feel guilty when they do something they judge is right! 
45Rm 14:23 But if they have doubts about what they eat, God condemns them when they eat it, because their action is not based on faith. And anything that is not based on faith is sin. 
45Rm 15:1 We who are strong in the faith ought to help the weak to carry their burdens. We should not please ourselves. 
45Rm 15:2 Instead, we should all please other believers for their own good, in order to build them up in the faith. 
45Rm 15:3 For Christ did not please himself. Instead, as the scripture says, "The insults which are hurled at you have fallen on me." 
45Rm 15:4 Everything written in the Scriptures was written to teach us, in order that we might have hope through the patience and encouragement which the Scriptures give us. 
45Rm 15:5 And may God, the source of patience and encouragement, enable you to have the same point of view among yourselves by following the example of Christ Jesus, 
45Rm 15:6 so that all of you together may praise with one voice the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
45Rm 15:7 Accept one another, then, for the glory of God, as Christ has accepted you. 
45Rm 15:8 For I tell you that Christ's life of service was on behalf of the Jews, to show that God is faithful, to make his promises to their ancestors come true, 
45Rm 15:9 and to enable even the Gentiles to praise God for his mercy. As the scripture says, "And so I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing praises to you." 
45Rm 15:10 Again it says, "Rejoice, Gentiles, with God's people!" 
45Rm 15:11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all Gentiles; praise him, all peoples!" 
45Rm 15:12 And again, Isaiah says, "A descendant of Jesse will appear; he will come to rule the Gentiles, and they will put their hope in him." 
45Rm 15:13 May God, the source of hope, fill you with all joy and peace by means of your faith in him, so that your hope will continue to grow by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
45Rm 15:14 My friends£º I myself feel sure that you are full of goodness, that you have all knowledge, and that you are able to teach one another. 
45Rm 15:15 But in this letter I have been quite bold about certain subjects of which I have reminded you. I have been bold because of the privilege God has given me 
45Rm 15:16 of being a servant of Christ Jesus to work for the Gentiles. I serve like a priest in preaching the Good News from God, in order that the Gentiles may be an offering acceptable to God, dedicated to him by the Holy Spirit. 
45Rm 15:17 In union with Christ Jesus, then, I can be proud of my service for God. 
45Rm 15:18 I will be bold and speak only about what Christ has done through me to lead the Gentiles to obey God. He has done this by means of words and deeds, 
45Rm 15:19 by the power of miracles and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God. And so, in traveling all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum, I have proclaimed fully the Good News about Christ. 
45Rm 15:20 My ambition has always been to proclaim the Good News in places where Christ has not been heard of, so as not to build on a foundation laid by someone else. 
45Rm 15:21 As the scripture says, "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand." 
45Rm 15:22 And so I have been prevented many times from coming to you. 
45Rm 15:23 But now that I have finished my work in these regions and since I have been wanting for so many years to come to see you, 
45Rm 15:24 I hope to do so now. I would like to see you on my way to Spain, and be helped by you to go there, after I have enjoyed visiting you for a while. 
45Rm 15:25 Right now, however, I am going to Jerusalem in the service of God's people there. 
45Rm 15:26 For the churches in Macedonia and Achaia have freely decided to give an offering to help the poor among God's people in Jerusalem. 
45Rm 15:27 That decision was their own; but, as a matter of fact, they have an obligation to help them. Since the Jews shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles, the Gentiles ought to use their material blessings to help the Jews. 
45Rm 15:28 When I have finished this task and have turned over to them all the money that has been raised for them, I shall leave for Spain and visit you on my way there. 
45Rm 15:29 When I come to you, I know that I shall come with a full measure of the blessing of Christ. 
45Rm 15:30 I urge you, friends, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that the Spirit gives£º join me in praying fervently to God for me. 
45Rm 15:31 Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to God's people there. 
45Rm 15:32 And so I will come to you full of joy, if it is God's will, and enjoy a refreshing visit with you. 
45Rm 15:33 May God, our source of peace, be with all of you. Amen. 
45Rm 16:1 I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, who serves the church at Cenchreae. 
45Rm 16:2 Receive her in the Lord's name, as God's people should, and give her any help she may need from you; for she herself has been a good friend to many people and also to me. 
45Rm 16:3 I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in the service of Christ Jesus; 
45Rm 16:4 they risked their lives for me. I am grateful to them - not only I, but all the Gentile churches as well. 
45Rm 16:5 Greetings also to the church that meets in their house. Greetings to my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first in the province of Asia to believe in Christ. 
45Rm 16:6 Greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for you. 
45Rm 16:7 Greetings also to Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews who were in prison with me; they are well known among the apostles, and they became Christians before I did. 
45Rm 16:8 My greetings to Ampliatus, my dear friend in the fellowship of the Lord. 
45Rm 16:9 Greetings also to Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ's service, and to Stachys, my dear friend. 
45Rm 16:10 Greetings to Apelles, whose loyalty to Christ has been proved. Greetings to those who belong to the family of Aristobulus. 
45Rm 16:11 Greetings to Herodion, a fellow Jew, and to the Christians in the family of Narcissus. 
45Rm 16:12 My greetings to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who work in the Lord's service, and to my dear friend Persis, who has done so much work for the Lord. 
45Rm 16:13 I send greetings to Rufus, that outstanding worker in the Lord's service, and to his mother, who has always treated me like a son. 
45Rm 16:14 My greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the other Christians with them. 
45Rm 16:15 Greetings to Philologus and Julia, to Nereus and his sister, to Olympas and to all of God's people who are with them. 
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with the kiss of peace. All the churches of Christ send you their greetings. 
45Rm 16:17 I urge you, my friends£º watch out for those who cause divisions and upset people's faith and go against the teaching which you have received. Keep away from them! 
45Rm 16:18 For those who do such things are not serving Christ our Lord, but their own appetites. By their fine words and flattering speech they deceive innocent people. 
45Rm 16:19 Everyone has heard of your loyalty to the gospel, and for this reason I am happy about you. I want you to be wise about what is good, but innocent in what is evil. 
45Rm 16:20 And God, our source of peace, will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. 
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings; and so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, fellow Jews. 
45Rm 16:22 I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, send you Christian greetings. 
45Rm 16:23 My host Gaius, in whose house the church meets, sends you his greetings; Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings. 
45Rm 16:24 OMITTED TEXT
45Rm 16:25 Let us give glory to God! He is able to make you stand firm in your faith, according to the Good News I preach about Jesus Christ and according to the revelation of the secret truth which was hidden for long ages in the past. 
45Rm 16:26 Now, however, that truth has been brought out into the open through the writings of the prophets; and by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations, so that all may believe and obey. 
45Rm 16:27 To the only God, who alone is all-wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever! Amen.

461Co 1:1 From Paul, who was called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Sosthenes - 
461Co 1:2 To the church of God which is in Corinth, to all who are called to be God's holy people, who belong to him in union with Christ Jesus, together with all people everywhere who worship our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours£º 
461Co 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
461Co 1:4 I always give thanks to my God for you because of the grace he has given you through Christ Jesus. 
461Co 1:5 For in union with Christ you have become rich in all things, including all speech and all knowledge. 
461Co 1:6 The message about Christ has become so firmly established in you 
461Co 1:7 that you have not failed to receive a single blessing, as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. 
461Co 1:8 He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be faultless on the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
461Co 1:9 God is to be trusted, the God who called you to have fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord. 
461Co 1:10 By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ I appeal to all of you, my friends, to agree in what you say, so that there will be no divisions among you. Be completely united, with only one thought and one purpose. 
461Co 1:11 For some people from Chloe's family have told me quite plainly, my friends, that there are quarrels among you. 
461Co 1:12 Let me put it this way£º each one of you says something different. One says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Peter"; and another, "I follow Christ." 
461Co 1:13 Christ has been divided into groups! Was it Paul who died on the cross for you? Were you baptized as Paul's disciples? 
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius. 
461Co 1:15 No one can say, then, that you were baptized as my disciples. 
461Co 1:16 (Oh yes, I also baptized Stephanas and his family; but I can't remember whether I baptized anyone else.) 
461Co 1:17 Christ did not send me to baptize. He sent me to tell the Good News, and to tell it without using the language of human wisdom, in order to make sure that Christ's death on the cross is not robbed of its power. 
461Co 1:18 For the message about Christ's death on the cross is nonsense to those who are being lost; but for us who are being saved it is God's power. 
461Co 1:19 The scripture says, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of the scholars." 
461Co 1:20 So then, where does that leave the wise? or the scholars? or the skillful debaters of this world? God has shown that this world's wisdom is foolishness! 
461Co 1:21 For God in his wisdom made it impossible for people to know him by means of their own wisdom. Instead, by means of the so-called "foolish" message we preach, God decided to save those who believe. 
461Co 1:22 Jews want miracles for proof, and Greeks look for wisdom. 
461Co 1:23 As for us, we proclaim the crucified Christ, a message that is offensive to the Jews and nonsense to the Gentiles; 
461Co 1:24 but for those whom God has called, both Jews and Gentiles, this message is Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 
461Co 1:25 For what seems to be God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and what seems to be God's weakness is stronger than human strength. 
461Co 1:26 Now remember what you were, my friends, when God called you. From the human point of view few of you were wise or powerful or of high social standing. 
461Co 1:27 God purposely chose what the world considers nonsense in order to shame the wise, and he chose what the world considers weak in order to shame the powerful. 
461Co 1:28 He chose what the world looks down on and despises and thinks is nothing, in order to destroy what the world thinks is important. 
461Co 1:29 This means that no one can boast in God's presence. 
461Co 1:30 But God has brought you into union with Christ Jesus, and God has made Christ to be our wisdom. By him we are put right with God; we become God's holy people and are set free. 
461Co 1:31 So then, as the scripture says, "Whoever wants to boast must boast of what the Lord has done." 
461Co 2:1 When I came to you, my friends, to preach God's secret truth, I did not use big words and great learning. 
461Co 2:2 For while I was with you, I made up my mind to forget everything except Jesus Christ and especially his death on the cross. 
461Co 2:3 So when I came to you, I was weak and trembled all over with fear, 
461Co 2:4 and my teaching and message were not delivered with skillful words of human wisdom, but with convincing proof of the power of God's Spirit. 
461Co 2:5 Your faith, then, does not rest on human wisdom but on God's power. 
461Co 2:6 Yet I do proclaim a message of wisdom to those who are spiritually mature. But it is not the wisdom that belongs to this world or to the powers that rule this world - powers that are losing their power. 
461Co 2:7 The wisdom I proclaim is God's secret wisdom, which is hidden from human beings, but which he had already chosen for our glory even before the world was made. 
461Co 2:8 None of the rulers of this world knew this wisdom. If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
461Co 2:9 However, as the scripture says, "What no one ever saw or heard, what no one ever thought could happen, is the very thing God prepared for those who love him." 
461Co 2:10 But it was to us that God made known his secret by means of his Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, even the hidden depths of God's purposes. 
461Co 2:11 It is only our own spirit within us that knows all about us; in the same way, only God's Spirit knows all about God. 
461Co 2:12 We have not received this world's spirit; instead, we have received the Spirit sent by God, so that we may know all that God has given us. 
461Co 2:13 So then, we do not speak in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual truths to those who have the Spirit. 
461Co 2:14 Whoever does not have the Spirit cannot receive the gifts that come from God's Spirit. Such a person really does not understand them, and they seem to be nonsense, because their value can be judged only on a spiritual basis. 
461Co 2:15 Whoever has the Spirit, however, is able to judge the value of everything, but no one is able to judge him. 
461Co 2:16 As the scripture says, "Who knows the mind of the Lord? Who is able to give him advice?" We, however, have the mind of Christ. 
461Co 3:1 As a matter of fact, my friends, I could not talk to you as I talk to people who have the Spirit; I had to talk to you as though you belonged to this world, as children in the Christian faith. 
461Co 3:2 I had to feed you milk, not solid food, because you were not ready for it. And even now you are not ready for it, 
461Co 3:3 because you still live as the people of this world live. When there is jealousy among you and you quarrel with one another, doesn't this prove that you belong to this world, living by its standards? 
461Co 3:4 When one of you says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos" - aren't you acting like worldly people? 
461Co 3:5 After all, who is Apollos? And who is Paul? We are simply God's servants, by whom you were led to believe. Each one of us does the work which the Lord gave him to do£º 
461Co 3:6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered the plant, but it was God who made the plant grow. 
461Co 3:7 The one who plants and the one who waters really do not matter. It is God who matters, because he makes the plant grow. 
461Co 3:8 There is no difference between the one who plants and the one who waters; God will reward each one according to the work each has done. 
461Co 3:9 For we are partners working together for God, and you are God's field. You are also God's building. 
461Co 3:10 Using the gift that God gave me, I did the work of an expert builder and laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each of you must be careful how you build. 
461Co 3:11 For God has already placed Jesus Christ as the one and only foundation, and no other foundation can be laid. 
461Co 3:12 Some will use gold or silver or precious stones in building on the foundation; others will use wood or grass or straw. 
461Co 3:13 And the quality of each person's work will be seen when the Day of Christ exposes it. For on that Day fire will reveal everyone's work; the fire will test it and show its real quality. 
461Co 3:14 If what was built on the foundation survives the fire, the builder will receive a reward. 
461Co 3:15 But if your work is burnt up, then you will lose it; but you yourself will be saved, as if you had escaped through the fire. 
461Co 3:16 Surely you know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you! 
461Co 3:17 God will destroy anyone who destroys God's temple. For God's temple is holy, and you yourselves are his temple. 
461Co 3:18 You should not fool yourself. If any of you think that you are wise by this world's standards, you should become a fool, in order to be really wise. 
461Co 3:19 For what this world considers to be wisdom is nonsense in God's sight. As the scripture says, "God traps the wise in their cleverness"; 
461Co 3:20 and another scripture says, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless." 
461Co 3:21 No one, then, should boast about what human beings can do. Actually everything belongs to you£º 
461Co 3:22 Paul, Apollos, and Peter; this world, life and death, the present and the future - all these are yours, 
461Co 3:23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. 
461Co 4:1 You should think of us as Christ's servants, who have been put in charge of God's secret truths. 
461Co 4:2 The one thing required of such servants is that they be faithful to their master. 
461Co 4:3 Now, I am not at all concerned about being judged by you or by any human standard; I don't even pass judgment on myself. 
461Co 4:4 My conscience is clear, but that does not prove that I am really innocent. The Lord is the one who passes judgment on me. 
461Co 4:5 So you should not pass judgment on anyone before the right time comes. Final judgment must wait until the Lord comes; he will bring to light the dark secrets and expose the hidden purposes of people's minds. And then all will receive from God the praise they deserve. 
461Co 4:6 For your sake, my friends, I have applied all this to Apollos and me, using the two of us as an example, so that you may learn what the saying means, "Observe the proper rules." None of you should be proud of one person and despise another. 
461Co 4:7 Who made you superior to others? Didn't God give you everything you have? Well, then, how can you boast, as if what you have were not a gift? 
461Co 4:8 Do you already have everything you need? Are you already rich? Have you become kings, even though we are not? Well, I wish you really were kings, so that we could be kings together with you. 
461Co 4:9 For it seems to me that God has given the very last place to us apostles, like people condemned to die in public as a spectacle for the whole world of angels and of human beings. 
461Co 4:10 For Christ's sake we are fools; but you are wise in union with Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! We are despised, but you are honored! 
461Co 4:11 To this very moment we go hungry and thirsty; we are clothed in rags; we are beaten; we wander from place to place; 
461Co 4:12 we wear ourselves out with hard work. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure; 
461Co 4:13 when we are insulted, we answer back with kind words. We are no more than this world's garbage; we are the scum of the earth to this very moment! 
461Co 4:14 I write this to you, not because I want to make you feel ashamed, but to instruct you as my own dear children. 
461Co 4:15 For even if you have ten thousand guardians in your Christian life, you have only one father. For in your life in union with Christ Jesus I have become your father by bringing the Good News to you. 
461Co 4:16 I beg you, then, to follow my example. 
461Co 4:17 For this purpose I am sending to you Timothy, who is my own dear and faithful son in the Christian life. He will remind you of the principles which I follow in the new life in union with Christ Jesus and which I teach in all the churches everywhere. 
461Co 4:18 Some of you have become proud because you have thought that I would not be coming to visit you. 
461Co 4:19 If the Lord is willing, however, I will come to you soon, and then I will find out for myself the power which these proud people have, and not just what they say. 
461Co 4:20 For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of words but of power. 
461Co 4:21 Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in a spirit of love and gentleness? 
461Co 5:1 Now, it is actually being said that there is sexual immorality among you so terrible that not even the heathen would be guilty of it. I am told that a man is sleeping with his stepmother! 
461Co 5:2 How, then, can you be proud? On the contrary, you should be filled with sadness, and the man who has done such a thing should be expelled from your fellowship. 
461Co 5:3 And even though I am far away from you in body, still I am there with you in spirit; and as though I were there with you, I have in the name of our Lord Jesus already passed judgment on the man who has done this terrible thing. 
461Co 5:4 As you meet together, and I meet with you in my spirit, by the power of our Lord Jesus present with us, 
461Co 5:5 you are to hand this man over to Satan for his body to be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord. 
461Co 5:6 It is not right for you to be proud! You know the saying, "A little bit of yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise." 
461Co 5:7 You must remove the old yeast of sin so that you will be entirely pure. Then you will be like a new batch of dough without any yeast, as indeed I know you actually are. For our Passover Festival is ready, now that Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
461Co 5:8 Let us celebrate our Passover, then, not with bread having the old yeast of sin and wickedness, but with the bread that has no yeast, the bread of purity and truth. 
461Co 5:9 In the letter that I wrote you I told you not to associate with immoral people. 
461Co 5:10 Now I did not mean pagans who are immoral or greedy or are thieves, or who worship idols. To avoid them you would have to get out of the world completely. 
461Co 5:11 What I meant was that you should not associate with a person who calls himself a believer but is immoral or greedy or worships idols or is a slanderer or a drunkard or a thief. Don't even sit down to eat with such a person. 
461Co 5:12 After all, it is none of my business to judge outsiders. God will judge them. But should you not judge the members of your own fellowship? 
461Co 5:13 As the scripture says, "Remove the evil person from your group." 
461Co 6:1 If any of you have a dispute with another Christian, how dare you go before heathen judges instead of letting God's people settle the matter? 
461Co 6:2 Don't you know that God's people will judge the world? Well, then, if you are to judge the world, aren't you capable of judging small matters? 
461Co 6:3 Do you not know that we shall judge the angels? How much more, then, the things of this life! 
461Co 6:4 If such matters come up, are you going to take them to be settled by people who have no standing in the church? 
461Co 6:5 Shame on you! Surely there is at least one wise person in your fellowship who can settle a dispute between fellow Christians. 
461Co 6:6 Instead, one Christian goes to court against another and lets unbelievers judge the case! 
461Co 6:7 The very fact that you have legal disputes among yourselves shows that you have failed completely. Would it not be better for you to be wronged? Would it not be better for you to be robbed? 
461Co 6:8 Instead, you yourselves wrong one another and rob one another, even other believers! 
461Co 6:9 Surely you know that the wicked will not possess God's Kingdom. Do not fool yourselves; people who are immoral or who worship idols or are adulterers or homosexual perverts 
461Co 6:10 or who steal or are greedy or are drunkards or who slander others or are thieves - none of these will possess God's Kingdom. 
461Co 6:11 Some of you were like that. But you have been purified from sin; you have been dedicated to God; you have been put right with God by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. 
461Co 6:12 Someone will say, "I am allowed to do anything." Yes; but not everything is good for you. I could say that I am allowed to do anything, but I am not going to let anything make me its slave. 
461Co 6:13 Someone else will say, "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food." Yes; but God will put an end to both. The body is not to be used for sexual immorality, but to serve the Lord; and the Lord provides for the body. 
461Co 6:14 God raised the Lord from death, and he will also raise us by his power. 
461Co 6:15 You know that your bodies are parts of the body of Christ. Shall I take a part of Christ's body and make it part of the body of a prostitute? Impossible! 
461Co 6:16 Or perhaps you don't know that the man who joins his body to a prostitute becomes physically one with her? The scripture says quite plainly, "The two will become one body." 
461Co 6:17 But he who joins himself to the Lord becomes spiritually one with him. 
461Co 6:18 Avoid immorality. Any other sin a man commits does not affect his body; but the man who is guilty of sexual immorality sins against his own body. 
461Co 6:19 Don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and who was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourselves but to God; 
461Co 6:20 he bought you for a price. So use your bodies for God's glory. 
461Co 7:1 Now, to deal with the matters you wrote about. A man does well not to marry. 
461Co 7:2 But because there is so much immorality, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband. 
461Co 7:3 A man should fulfill his duty as a husband, and a woman should fulfill her duty as a wife, and each should satisfy the other's needs. 
461Co 7:4 A wife is not the master of her own body, but her husband is; in the same way a husband is not the master of his own body, but his wife is. 
461Co 7:5 Do not deny yourselves to each other, unless you first agree to do so for a while in order to spend your time in prayer; but then resume normal marital relations. In this way you will be kept from giving in to Satan's temptation because of your lack of self-control. 
461Co 7:6 I tell you this not as an order, but simply as a permission. 
461Co 7:7 Actually I would prefer that all of you were as I am; but each one has a special gift from God, one person this gift, another one that gift. 
461Co 7:8 Now, to the unmarried and to the widows I say that it would be better for you to continue to live alone as I do. 
461Co 7:9 But if you cannot restrain your desires, go ahead and marry - it is better to marry than to burn with passion. 
461Co 7:10 For married people I have a command which is not my own but the Lord's£º a wife must not leave her husband; 
461Co 7:11 but if she does, she must remain single or else be reconciled to her husband; and a husband must not divorce his wife. 
461Co 7:12 To the others I say (I, myself, not the Lord)£º if a Christian man has a wife who is an unbeliever and she agrees to go on living with him, he must not divorce her. 
461Co 7:13 And if a Christian woman is married to a man who is an unbeliever and he agrees to go on living with her, she must not divorce him. 
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is made acceptable to God by being united to his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made acceptable to God by being united to her Christian husband. If this were not so, their children would be like pagan children; but as it is, they are acceptable to God. 
461Co 7:15 However, if the one who is not a believer wishes to leave the Christian partner, let it be so. In such cases the Christian partner, whether husband or wife, is free to act. God has called you to live in peace. 
461Co 7:16 How can you be sure, Christian wife, that you will not save your husband? Or how can you be sure, Christian husband, that you will not save your wife? 
461Co 7:17 Each of you should go on living according to the Lord's gift to you, and as you were when God called you. This is the rule I teach in all the churches. 
461Co 7:18 If a circumcised man has accepted God's call, he should not try to remove the marks of circumcision; if an uncircumcised man has accepted God's call, he should not get circumcised. 
461Co 7:19 For whether or not a man is circumcised means nothing; what matters is to obey God's commandments. 
461Co 7:20 Each of you should remain as you were when you accepted God's call. 
461Co 7:21 Were you a slave when God called you? Well, never mind; but if you have a chance to become free, use it. 
461Co 7:22 For a slave who has been called by the Lord is the Lord's free person; in the same way a free person who has been called by Christ is his slave. 
461Co 7:23 God bought you for a price; so do not become slaves of people. 
461Co 7:24 My friends, each of you should remain in fellowship with God in the same condition that you were when you were called. 
461Co 7:25 Now, concerning what you wrote about unmarried people£º I do not have a command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is worthy of trust. 
461Co 7:26 Considering the present distress, I think it is better for a man to stay as he is. 
461Co 7:27 Do you have a wife? Then don't try to get rid of her. Are you unmarried? Then don't look for a wife. 
461Co 7:28 But if you do marry, you haven't committed a sin; and if an unmarried woman marries, she hasn't committed a sin. But I would rather spare you the everyday troubles that married people will have. 
461Co 7:29 What I mean, my friends, is this£º there is not much time left, and from now on married people should live as though they were not married; 
461Co 7:30 those who weep, as though they were not sad; those who laugh, as though they were not happy; those who buy, as though they did not own what they bought; 
461Co 7:31 those who deal in material goods, as though they were not fully occupied with them. For this world, as it is now, will not last much longer. 
461Co 7:32 I would like you to be free from worry. An unmarried man concerns himself with the Lord's work, because he is trying to please the Lord. 
461Co 7:33 But a married man concerns himself with worldly matters, because he wants to please his wife; 
461Co 7:34 and so he is pulled in two directions. An unmarried woman or a virgin concerns herself with the Lord's work, because she wants to be dedicated both in body and spirit; but a married woman concerns herself with worldly matters, because she wants to please her husband. 
461Co 7:35 I am saying this because I want to help you. I am not trying to put restrictions on you. Instead, I want you to do what is right and proper, and to give yourselves completely to the Lord's service without any reservation. 
461Co 7:36 In the case of an engaged couple who have decided not to marry£º if the man feels that he is not acting properly toward the young woman and if his passions are too strong and he feels that they ought to marry, then they should get married, as he wants to. There is no sin in this. 
461Co 7:37 But if a man, without being forced to do so, has firmly made up his mind not to marry, and if he has his will under complete control and has already decided in his own mind what to do - then he does well not to marry the young woman. 
461Co 7:38 So the man who marries does well, but the one who doesn't marry does even better. 
461Co 7:39 A married woman is not free as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, then she is free to be married to any man she wishes, but only if he is a Christian. 
461Co 7:40 She will be happier, however, if she stays as she is. That is my opinion, and I think that I too have God's Spirit. 
461Co 8:1 Now, concerning what you wrote about food offered to idols. It is true, of course, that "all of us have knowledge," as they say. Such knowledge, however, puffs a person up with pride; but love builds up. 
461Co 8:2 Those who think they know something really don't know as they ought to know. 
461Co 8:3 But the person who loves God is known by him. 
461Co 8:4 So then, about eating the food offered to idols£º we know that an idol stands for something that does not really exist; we know that there is only the one God. 
461Co 8:5 Even if there are so-called "gods," whether in heaven or on earth, and even though there are many of these "gods" and "lords," 
461Co 8:6 yet there is for us only one God, the Father, who is the Creator of all things and for whom we live; and there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created and through whom we live. 
461Co 8:7 But not everyone knows this truth. Some people have been so used to idols that to this day when they eat such food they still think of it as food that belongs to an idol; their conscience is weak, and they feel they are defiled by the food. 
461Co 8:8 Food, however, will not improve our relation with God; we shall not lose anything if we do not eat, nor shall we gain anything if we do eat. 
461Co 8:9 Be careful, however, not to let your freedom of action make those who are weak in the faith fall into sin. 
461Co 8:10 Suppose a person whose conscience is weak in this matter sees you, who have so-called "knowledge," eating in the temple of an idol; will not this encourage him to eat food offered to idols? 
461Co 8:11 And so this weak person, your brother for whom Christ died, will perish because of your "knowledge"! 
461Co 8:12 And in this way you will be sinning against Christ by sinning against other Christians and wounding their weak conscience. 
461Co 8:13 So then, if food makes a believer sin, I will never eat meat again, so as not to make a believer fall into sin. 
461Co 9:1 Am I not a free man? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord? And aren't you the result of my work for the Lord? 
461Co 9:2 Even if others do not accept me as an apostle, surely you do! Because of your life in union with the Lord you yourselves are proof of the fact that I am an apostle. 
461Co 9:3 When people criticize me, this is how I defend myself£º 
461Co 9:4 Don't I have the right to be given food and drink for my work? 
461Co 9:5 Don't I have the right to follow the example of the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter, by taking a Christian wife with me on my trips? 
461Co 9:6 Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have to work for our living? 
461Co 9:7 What soldiers ever have to pay their own expenses in the army? What farmers do not eat the grapes from their own vineyard? What shepherds do not use the milk from their own sheep? 
461Co 9:8 I don't have to limit myself to these everyday examples, because the Law says the same thing. 
461Co 9:9 We read in the Law of Moses, "Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain." Now, is God concerned about oxen? 
461Co 9:10 Didn't he really mean us when he said that? Of course that was written for us. Anyone who plows and anyone who reaps should do their work in the hope of getting a share of the crop. 
461Co 9:11 We have sown spiritual seed among you. Is it too much if we reap material benefits from you? 
461Co 9:12 If others have the right to expect this from you, don't we have an even greater right? But we haven't made use of this right. Instead, we have endured everything in order not to put any obstacle in the way of the Good News about Christ. 
461Co 9:13 Surely you know that the men who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple and that those who offer the sacrifices on the altar get a share of the sacrifices. 
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who preach the gospel should get their living from it. 
461Co 9:15 But I haven't made use of any of these rights, nor am I writing this now in order to claim such rights for myself. I would rather die first! Nobody is going to turn my rightful boast into empty words! 
461Co 9:16 I have no right to boast just because I preach the gospel. After all, I am under orders to do so. And how terrible it would be for me if I did not preach the gospel! 
461Co 9:17 If I did my work as a matter of free choice, then I could expect to be paid; but I do it as a matter of duty, because God has entrusted me with this task. 
461Co 9:18 What pay do I get, then? It is the privilege of preaching the Good News without charging for it, without claiming my rights in my work for the gospel. 
461Co 9:19 I am a free man, nobody's slave; but I make myself everybody's slave in order to win as many people as possible. 
461Co 9:20 While working with the Jews, I live like a Jew in order to win them; and even though I myself am not subject to the Law of Moses, I live as though I were when working with those who are, in order to win them. 
461Co 9:21 In the same way, when working with Gentiles, I live like a Gentile, outside the Jewish Law, in order to win Gentiles. This does not mean that I don't obey God's law; I am really under Christ's law. 
461Co 9:22 Among the weak in faith I become weak like one of them, in order to win them. So I become all things to all people, that I may save some of them by whatever means are possible. 
461Co 9:23 All this I do for the gospel's sake, in order to share in its blessings. 
461Co 9:24 Surely you know that many runners take part in a race, but only one of them wins the prize. Run, then, in such a way as to win the prize. 
461Co 9:25 Every athlete in training submits to strict discipline, in order to be crowned with a wreath that will not last; but we do it for one that will last forever. 
461Co 9:26 That is why I run straight for the finish line; that is why I am like a boxer who does not waste his punches. 
461Co 9:27 I harden my body with blows and bring it under complete control, to keep myself from being disqualified after having called others to the contest. 
461Co 10:1 I want you to remember, my friends, what happened to our ancestors who followed Moses. They were all under the protection of the cloud, and all passed safely through the Red Sea. 
461Co 10:2 In the cloud and in the sea they were all baptized as followers of Moses. 
461Co 10:3 All ate the same spiritual bread 
461Co 10:4 and drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that went with them; and that rock was Christ himself. 
461Co 10:5 But even then God was not pleased with most of them, and so their dead bodies were scattered over the desert. 
461Co 10:6 Now, all of this is an example for us, to warn us not to desire evil things, as they did, 
461Co 10:7 nor to worship idols, as some of them did. As the scripture says, "The people sat down to a feast which turned into an orgy of drinking and sex." 
461Co 10:8 We must not be guilty of sexual immorality, as some of them were - and in one day twenty-three thousand of them fell dead. 
461Co 10:9 We must not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did - and they were killed by snakes. 
461Co 10:10 We must not complain, as some of them did - and they were destroyed by the Angel of Death. 
461Co 10:11 All these things happened to them as examples for others, and they were written down as a warning for us. For we live at a time when the end is about to come. 
461Co 10:12 If you think you are standing firm you had better be careful that you do not fall. 
461Co 10:13 Every test that you have experienced is the kind that normally comes to people. But God keeps his promise, and he will not allow you to be tested beyond your power to remain firm; at the time you are put to the test, he will give you the strength to endure it, and so provide you with a way out. 
461Co 10:14 So then, my dear friends, keep away from the worship of idols. 
461Co 10:15 I speak to you as sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
461Co 10:16 The cup we use in the Lord's Supper and for which we give thanks to God£º when we drink from it, we are sharing in the blood of Christ. And the bread we break£º when we eat it, we are sharing in the body of Christ. 
461Co 10:17 Because there is the one loaf of bread, all of us, though many, are one body, for we all share the same loaf. 
461Co 10:18 Consider the people of Israel; those who eat what is offered in sacrifice share in the altar's service to God. 
461Co 10:19 Do I imply, then, that an idol or the food offered to it really amounts to anything? 
461Co 10:20 No! What I am saying is that what is sacrificed on pagan altars is offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be partners with demons. 
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink from the Lord's cup and also from the cup of demons; you cannot eat at the Lord's table and also at the table of demons. 
461Co 10:22 Or do we want to make the Lord jealous? Do we think that we are stronger than he? 
461Co 10:23 "We are allowed to do anything," so they say. That is true, but not everything is good. "We are allowed to do anything" - but not everything is helpful. 
461Co 10:24 None of you should be looking out for your own interests, but for the interests of others. 
461Co 10:25 You are free to eat anything sold in the meat market, without asking any questions because of your conscience. 
461Co 10:26 For, as the scripture says, "The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord." 
461Co 10:27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you decide to go, eat what is set before you, without asking any questions because of your conscience. 
461Co 10:28 But if someone tells you, "This food was offered to idols," then do not eat that food, for the sake of the one who told you and for conscience' sake - 
461Co 10:29 that is, not your own conscience, but the other person's conscience. "Well, then," someone asks, "why should my freedom to act be limited by another person's conscience? 
461Co 10:30 If I thank God for my food, why should anyone criticize me about food for which I give thanks?" 
461Co 10:31 Well, whatever you do, whether you eat or drink, do it all for God's glory. 
461Co 10:32 Live in such a way as to cause no trouble either to Jews or Gentiles or to the church of God. 
461Co 10:33 Just do as I do; I try to please everyone in all that I do, not thinking of my own good, but of the good of all, so that they might be saved. 
461Co 11:1 Imitate me, then, just as I imitate Christ. 
461Co 11:2 I praise you because you always remember me and follow the teachings that I have handed on to you. 
461Co 11:3 But I want you to understand that Christ is supreme over every man, the husband is supreme over his wife, and God is supreme over Christ. 
461Co 11:4 So a man who prays or proclaims God's message in public worship with his head covered disgraces Christ. 
461Co 11:5 And any woman who prays or proclaims God's message in public worship with nothing on her head disgraces her husband; there is no difference between her and a woman whose head has been shaved. 
461Co 11:6 If the woman does not cover her head, she might as well cut her hair. And since it is a shameful thing for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair, she should cover her head. 
461Co 11:7 A man has no need to cover his head, because he reflects the image and glory of God. But woman reflects the glory of man; 
461Co 11:8 for man was not created from woman, but woman from man. 
461Co 11:9 Nor was man created for woman's sake, but woman was created for man's sake. 
461Co 11:10 On account of the angels, then, a woman should have a covering over her head to show that she is under her husband's authority. 
461Co 11:11 In our life in the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
461Co 11:12 For as woman was made from man, in the same way man is born of woman; and it is God who brings everything into existence. 
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves whether it is proper for a woman to pray to God in public worship with nothing on her head. 
461Co 11:14 Why, nature itself teaches you that long hair on a man is a disgrace, 
461Co 11:15 but on a woman it is a thing of beauty. Her long hair has been given her to serve as a covering. 
461Co 11:16 But if anyone wants to argue about it, all I have to say is that neither we nor the churches of God have any other custom in worship. 
461Co 11:17 In the following instructions, however, I do not praise you, because your meetings for worship actually do more harm than good. 
461Co 11:18 In the first place, I have been told that there are opposing groups in your meetings; and this I believe is partly true. 
461Co 11:19 (No doubt there must be divisions among you so that the ones who are in the right may be clearly seen.) 
461Co 11:20 When you meet together as a group, it is not the Lord's Supper that you eat. 
461Co 11:21 For as you eat, you each go ahead with your own meal, so that some are hungry while others get drunk. 
461Co 11:22 Don't you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or would you rather despise the church of God and put to shame the people who are in need? What do you expect me to say to you about this? Shall I praise you? Of course I don't! 
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord the teaching that I passed on to you£º that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took a piece of bread, 
461Co 11:24 gave thanks to God, broke it, and said, "This is my body, which is for you. Do this in memory of me." 
461Co 11:25 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup and said, "This cup is God's new covenant, sealed with my blood. Whenever you drink it, do so in memory of me." 
461Co 11:26 This means that every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 
461Co 11:27 It follows that if one of you eats the Lord's bread or drinks from his cup in a way that dishonors him, you are guilty of sin against the Lord's body and blood. 
461Co 11:28 So then, you should each examine yourself first, and then eat the bread and drink from the cup. 
461Co 11:29 For if you do not recognize the meaning of the Lord's body when you eat the bread and drink from the cup, you bring judgment on yourself as you eat and drink. 
461Co 11:30 That is why many of you are sick and weak, and several have died. 
461Co 11:31 If we would examine ourselves first, we would not come under God's judgment. 
461Co 11:32 But we are judged and punished by the Lord, so that we shall not be condemned together with the world. 
461Co 11:33 So then, my friends, when you gather together to eat the Lord's Supper, wait for one another. 
461Co 11:34 And if any of you are hungry, you should eat at home, so that you will not come under God's judgment as you meet together. As for the other matters, I will settle them when I come. 
461Co 12:1 Now, concerning what you wrote about the gifts from the Holy Spirit. I want you to know the truth about them, my friends. 
461Co 12:2 You know that while you were still heathen, you were led astray in many ways to the worship of lifeless idols. 
461Co 12:3 I want you to know that no one who is led by God's Spirit can say "A curse on Jesus!" and no one can confess "Jesus is Lord," without being guided by the Holy Spirit. 
461Co 12:4 There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit gives them. 
461Co 12:5 There are different ways of serving, but the same Lord is served. 
461Co 12:6 There are different abilities to perform service, but the same God gives ability to all for their particular service. 
461Co 12:7 The Spirit's presence is shown in some way in each person for the good of all. 
461Co 12:8 The Spirit gives one person a message full of wisdom, while to another person the same Spirit gives a message full of knowledge. 
461Co 12:9 One and the same Spirit gives faith to one person, while to another person he gives the power to heal. 
461Co 12:10 The Spirit gives one person the power to work miracles; to another, the gift of speaking God's message; and to yet another, the ability to tell the difference between gifts that come from the Spirit and those that do not. To one person he gives the ability to speak in strange tongues, and to another he gives the ability to explain what is said. 
461Co 12:11 But it is one and the same Spirit who does all this; as he wishes, he gives a different gift to each person. 
461Co 12:12 Christ is like a single body, which has many parts; it is still one body, even though it is made up of different parts. 
461Co 12:13 In the same way, all of us, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether slaves or free, have been baptized into the one body by the same Spirit, and we have all been given the one Spirit to drink. 
461Co 12:14 For the body itself is not made up of only one part, but of many parts. 
461Co 12:15 If the foot were to say, "Because I am not a hand, I don't belong to the body," that would not keep it from being a part of the body. 
461Co 12:16 And if the ear were to say, "Because I am not an eye, I don't belong to the body," that would not keep it from being a part of the body. 
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were just an eye, how could it hear? And if it were only an ear, how could it smell? 
461Co 12:18 As it is, however, God put every different part in the body just as he wanted it to be. 
461Co 12:19 There would not be a body if it were all only one part! 
461Co 12:20 As it is, there are many parts but one body. 
461Co 12:21 So then, the eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" Nor can the head say to the feet, "Well, I don't need you!" 
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, we cannot do without the parts of the body that seem to be weaker; 
461Co 12:23 and those parts that we think aren't worth very much are the ones which we treat with greater care; while the parts of the body which don't look very nice are treated with special modesty, 
461Co 12:24 which the more beautiful parts do not need. God himself has put the body together in such a way as to give greater honor to those parts that need it. 
461Co 12:25 And so there is no division in the body, but all its different parts have the same concern for one another. 
461Co 12:26 If one part of the body suffers, all the other parts suffer with it; if one part is praised, all the other parts share its happiness. 
461Co 12:27 All of you are Christ's body, and each one is a part of it. 
461Co 12:28 In the church God has put all in place£º in the first place apostles, in the second place prophets, and in the third place teachers; then those who perform miracles, followed by those who are given the power to heal or to help others or to direct them or to speak in strange tongues. 
461Co 12:29 They are not all apostles or prophets or teachers. Not everyone has the power to work miracles 
461Co 12:30 or to heal diseases or to speak in strange tongues or to explain what is said. 
461Co 12:31 Set your hearts, then, on the more important gifts. Best of all, however, is the following way. 
461Co 13:1 I may be able to speak the languages of human beings and even of angels, but if I have no love, my speech is no more than a noisy gong or a clanging bell. 
461Co 13:2 I may have the gift of inspired preaching; I may have all knowledge and understand all secrets; I may have all the faith needed to move mountains - but if I have no love, I am nothing. 
461Co 13:3 I may give away everything I have, and even give up my body to be burned - but if I have no love, this does me no good. 
461Co 13:4 Love is patient and kind; it is not jealous or conceited or proud; 
461Co 13:5 love is not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs; 
461Co 13:6 love is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth. 
461Co 13:7 Love never gives up; and its faith, hope, and patience never fail. 
461Co 13:8 Love is eternal. There are inspired messages, but they are temporary; there are gifts of speaking in strange tongues, but they will cease; there is knowledge, but it will pass. 
461Co 13:9 For our gifts of knowledge and of inspired messages are only partial; 
461Co 13:10 but when what is perfect comes, then what is partial will disappear. 
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, my speech, feelings, and thinking were all those of a child; now that I am an adult, I have no more use for childish ways. 
461Co 13:12 What we see now is like a dim image in a mirror; then we shall see face-to-face. What I know now is only partial; then it will be complete - as complete as God's knowledge of me. 
461Co 13:13 Meanwhile these three remain£º faith, hope, and love; and the greatest of these is love. 
461Co 14:1 It is love, then, that you should strive for. Set your hearts on spiritual gifts, especially the gift of proclaiming God's message. 
461Co 14:2 Those who speak in strange tongues do not speak to others but to God, because no one understands them. They are speaking secret truths by the power of the Spirit. 
461Co 14:3 But those who proclaim God's message speak to people and give them help, encouragement, and comfort. 
461Co 14:4 Those who speak in strange tongues help only themselves, but those who proclaim God's message help the whole church. 
461Co 14:5 I would like for all of you to speak in strange tongues; but I would rather that you had the gift of proclaiming God's message. For the person who proclaims God's message is of greater value than the one who speaks in strange tongues - unless there is someone present who can explain what is said, so that the whole church may be helped. 
461Co 14:6 So when I come to you, my friends, what use will I be to you if I speak in strange tongues? Not a bit, unless I bring you some revelation from God or some knowledge or some inspired message or some teaching. 
461Co 14:7 Take such lifeless musical instruments as the flute or the harp - how will anyone know the tune that is being played unless the notes are sounded distinctly? 
461Co 14:8 And if the one who plays the bugle does not sound a clear call, who will prepare for battle? 
461Co 14:9 In the same way, how will anyone understand what you are talking about if your message given in strange tongues is not clear? Your words will vanish in the air! 
461Co 14:10 There are many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 
461Co 14:11 But if I do not know the language being spoken, those who use it will be foreigners to me and I will be a foreigner to them. 
461Co 14:12 Since you are eager to have the gifts of the Spirit, you must try above everything else to make greater use of those which help to build up the church. 
461Co 14:13 The person who speaks in strange tongues, then, must pray for the gift to explain what is said. 
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in this way, my spirit prays indeed, but my mind has no part in it. 
461Co 14:15 What should I do, then? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray also with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will sing also with my mind. 
461Co 14:16 When you give thanks to God in spirit only, how can ordinary people taking part in the meeting say "Amen" to your prayer of thanksgiving? They have no way of knowing what you are saying. 
461Co 14:17 Even if your prayer of thanks to God is quite good, other people are not helped at all. 
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in strange tongues much more than any of you. 
461Co 14:19 But in church worship I would rather speak five words that can be understood, in order to teach others, than speak thousands of words in strange tongues. 
461Co 14:20 Do not be like children in your thinking, my friends; be children so far as evil is concerned, but be grown up in your thinking. 
461Co 14:21 In the Scriptures it is written, "By means of people speaking strange languages I will speak to my people, says the Lord. I will speak through lips of foreigners, but even then my people will not listen to me." 
461Co 14:22 So then, the gift of speaking in strange tongues is proof for unbelievers, not for believers, while the gift of proclaiming God's message is proof for believers, not for unbelievers. 
461Co 14:23 If, then, the whole church meets together and everyone starts speaking in strange tongues - and if some ordinary people or unbelievers come in, won't they say that you are all crazy? 
461Co 14:24 But if everyone is proclaiming God's message when some unbelievers or ordinary people come in, they will be convinced of their sin by what they hear. They will be judged by all they hear, 
461Co 14:25 their secret thoughts will be brought into the open, and they will bow down and worship God, confessing, "Truly God is here among you!" 
461Co 14:26 This is what I mean, my friends. When you meet for worship, one person has a hymn, another a teaching, another a revelation from God, another a message in strange tongues, and still another the explanation of what is said. Everything must be of help to the church. 
461Co 14:27 If someone is going to speak in strange tongues, two or three at the most should speak, one after the other, and someone else must explain what is being said. 
461Co 14:28 But if no one is there who can explain, then the one who speaks in strange tongues must be quiet and speak only to himself and to God. 
461Co 14:29 Two or three who are given God's message should speak, while the others are to judge what they say. 
461Co 14:30 But if someone sitting in the meeting receives a message from God, the one who is speaking should stop. 
461Co 14:31 All of you may proclaim God's message, one by one, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged. 
461Co 14:32 The gift of proclaiming God's message should be under the speaker's control, 
461Co 14:33 because God does not want us to be in disorder but in harmony and peace. As in all the churches of God's people, 
461Co 14:34 the women should keep quiet in the meetings. They are not allowed to speak; as the Jewish Law says, they must not be in charge. 
461Co 14:35 If they want to find out about something, they should ask their husbands at home. It is a disgraceful thing for a woman to speak in a church meeting. 
461Co 14:36 Or could it be that the word of God came from you? Or are you the only ones to whom it came? 
461Co 14:37 If anyone supposes he is God's messenger or has a spiritual gift, he must realize that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. 
461Co 14:38 But if he does not pay attention to this, pay no attention to him. 
461Co 14:39 So then, my friends, set your heart on proclaiming God's message, but do not forbid the speaking in strange tongues. 
461Co 14:40 Everything must be done in a proper and orderly way. 
461Co 15:1 And now I want to remind you, my friends, of the Good News which I preached to you, which you received, and on which your faith stands firm. 
461Co 15:2 That is the gospel, the message that I preached to you. You are saved by the gospel if you hold firmly to it - unless it was for nothing that you believed. 
461Co 15:3 I passed on to you what I received, which is of the greatest importance£º that Christ died for our sins, as written in the Scriptures; 
461Co 15:4 that he was buried and that he was raised to life three days later, as written in the Scriptures; 
461Co 15:5 that he appeared to Peter and then to all twelve apostles. 
461Co 15:6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at once, most of whom are still alive, although some have died. 
461Co 15:7 Then he appeared to James, and afterward to all the apostles. 
461Co 15:8 Last of all he appeared also to me - even though I am like someone whose birth was abnormal. 
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of all the apostles - I do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted God's church. 
461Co 15:10 But by God's grace I am what I am, and the grace that he gave me was not without effect. On the contrary, I have worked harder than any of the other apostles, although it was not really my own doing, but God's grace working with me. 
461Co 15:11 So then, whether it came from me or from them, this is what we all preach, and this is what you believe. 
461Co 15:12 Now, since our message is that Christ has been raised from death, how can some of you say that the dead will not be raised to life? 
461Co 15:13 If that is true, it means that Christ was not raised; 
461Co 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised from death, then we have nothing to preach and you have nothing to believe. 
461Co 15:15 More than that, we are shown to be lying about God, because we said that he raised Christ from death - but if it is true that the dead are not raised to life, then he did not raise Christ. 
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised. 
461Co 15:17 And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is a delusion and you are still lost in your sins. 
461Co 15:18 It would also mean that the believers in Christ who have died are lost. 
461Co 15:19 If our hope in Christ is good for this life only and no more, then we deserve more pity than anyone else in all the world. 
461Co 15:20 But the truth is that Christ has been raised from death, as the guarantee that those who sleep in death will also be raised. 
461Co 15:21 For just as death came by means of a man, in the same way the rising from death comes by means of a man. 
461Co 15:22 For just as all people die because of their union with Adam, in the same way all will be raised to life because of their union with Christ. 
461Co 15:23 But each one will be raised in proper order£º Christ, first of all; then, at the time of his coming, those who belong to him. 
461Co 15:24 Then the end will come; Christ will overcome all spiritual rulers, authorities, and powers, and will hand over the Kingdom to God the Father. 
461Co 15:25 For Christ must rule until God defeats all enemies and puts them under his feet. 
461Co 15:26 The last enemy to be defeated will be death. 
461Co 15:27 For the scripture says, "God put {\I all things under his feet." It is clear, of course, that the words "all things" do not include God himself, who puts all things under Christ.
461Co 15:28 But when all things have been placed under Christ's rule, then he himself, the Son, will place himself under God, who placed all things under him; and God will rule completely over all. 
461Co 15:29 Now, what about those people who are baptized for the dead? What do they hope to accomplish? If it is true, as some claim, that the dead are not raised to life, why are those people being baptized for the dead? 
461Co 15:30 And as for us - why would we run the risk of danger every hour? 
461Co 15:31 My friends, I face death every day! The pride I have in you, in our life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord, makes me declare this. 
461Co 15:32 If I have, as it were, fought "wild beasts" here in Ephesus simply from human motives, what have I gained? But if the dead are not raised to life, then, as the saying goes, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die." 
461Co 15:33 Do not be fooled. "Bad companions ruin good character." 
461Co 15:34 Come back to your right senses and stop your sinful ways. I declare to your shame that some of you do not know God. 
461Co 15:35 Someone will ask, "How can the dead be raised to life? What kind of body will they have?" 
461Co 15:36 You fool! When you plant a seed in the ground, it does not sprout to life unless it dies. 
461Co 15:37 And what you plant is a bare seed, perhaps a grain of wheat or some other grain, not the full-bodied plant that will later grow up. 
461Co 15:38 God provides that seed with the body he wishes; he gives each seed its own proper body. 
461Co 15:39 And the flesh of living beings is not all the same kind of flesh; human beings have one kind of flesh, animals another, birds another, and fish another. 
461Co 15:40 And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; the beauty that belongs to heavenly bodies is different from the beauty that belongs to earthly bodies. 
461Co 15:41 The sun has its own beauty, the moon another beauty, and the stars a different beauty; and even among stars there are different kinds of beauty. 
461Co 15:42 This is how it will be when the dead are raised to life. When the body is buried, it is mortal; when raised, it will be immortal. 
461Co 15:43 When buried, it is ugly and weak; when raised, it will be beautiful and strong. 
461Co 15:44 When buried, it is a physical body; when raised, it will be a spiritual body. There is, of course, a physical body, so there has to be a spiritual body. 
461Co 15:45 For the scripture says, "The first man, Adam, was created a living being"; but the last Adam is the life-giving Spirit. 
461Co 15:46 It is not the spiritual that comes first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. 
461Co 15:47 The first Adam, made of earth, came from the earth; the second Adam came from heaven. 
461Co 15:48 Those who belong to the earth are like the one who was made of earth; those who are of heaven are like the one who came from heaven. 
461Co 15:49 Just as we wear the likeness of the man made of earth, so we will wear the likeness of the Man from heaven. 
461Co 15:50 What I mean, friends, is that what is made of flesh and blood cannot share in God's Kingdom, and what is mortal cannot possess immortality. 
461Co 15:51 Listen to this secret truth£º we shall not all die, but when the last trumpet sounds, we shall all be changed in an instant, as quickly as the blinking of an eye.
461Co 15:52 For when the trumpet sounds, the dead will be raised, never to die again, and we shall all be changed. 
461Co 15:53 For what is mortal must be changed into what is immortal; what will die must be changed into what cannot die. 
461Co 15:54 So when this takes place, and the mortal has been changed into the immortal, then the scripture will come true£º "Death is destroyed; victory is complete!" 
461Co 15:55 "Where, Death, is your victory? Where, Death, is your power to hurt?" 
461Co 15:56 Death gets its power to hurt from sin, and sin gets its power from the Law. 
461Co 15:57 But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 
461Co 15:58 So then, my dear friends, stand firm and steady. Keep busy always in your work for the Lord, since you know that nothing you do in the Lord's service is ever useless. 
461Co 16:1 Now, concerning what you wrote about the money to be raised to help God's people in Judea. You must do what I told the churches in Galatia to do. 
461Co 16:2 Every Sunday each of you must put aside some money, in proportion to what you have earned, and save it up, so that there will be no need to collect money when I come. 
461Co 16:3 After I come, I shall give letters of introduction to those you have approved, and send them to take your gift to Jerusalem. 
461Co 16:4 If it seems worthwhile for me to go, then they can go along with me. 
461Co 16:5 I shall come to you after I have gone through Macedonia - for I have to go through Macedonia. 
461Co 16:6 I shall probably spend some time with you, perhaps the whole winter, and then you can help me to continue my trip, wherever it is I shall go next. 
461Co 16:7 I want to see you more than just briefly in passing; I hope to spend quite a long time with you, if the Lord allows. 
461Co 16:8 I will stay here in Ephesus until the day of Pentecost. 
461Co 16:9 There is a real opportunity here for great and worthwhile work, even though there are many opponents. 
461Co 16:10 If Timothy comes your way, be sure to make him feel welcome among you, because he is working for the Lord, just as I am. 
461Co 16:11 No one should look down on him, but you must help him continue his trip in peace, so that he will come back to me; for I am expecting him back with the believers. 
461Co 16:12 Now, about brother Apollos. I have often encouraged him to visit you with the other believers, but he is not completely convinced that he should go at this time. When he gets the chance, however, he will go. 
461Co 16:13 Be alert, stand firm in the faith, be brave, be strong. 
461Co 16:14 Do all your work in love. 
461Co 16:15 You know about Stephanas and his family; they are the first Christian converts in Achaia and have given themselves to the service of God's people. I beg you, my friends, 
461Co 16:16 to follow the leadership of such people as these, and of anyone else who works and serves with them. 
461Co 16:17 I am happy about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; they have made up for your absence 
461Co 16:18 and have cheered me up, just as they cheered you up. Such men as these deserve notice. 
461Co 16:19 The churches in the province of Asia send you their greetings; Aquila and Priscilla and the church that meets in their house send warm Christian greetings. 
461Co 16:20 All the believers here send greetings. Greet one another with the kiss of peace. 
461Co 16:21 With my own hand I write this£º {\I Greetings from Paul.
461Co 16:22 Whoever does not love the Lord - a curse on him! {\I Marana tha - Our Lord, come!
461Co 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 
461Co 16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. 
47
472Co 1:1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and from our brother Timothy - To the church of God in Corinth, and to all God's people throughout Achaia£º 
472Co 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
472Co 1:3 Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the merciful Father, the God from whom all help comes! 
472Co 1:4 He helps us in all our troubles, so that we are able to help others who have all kinds of troubles, using the same help that we ourselves have received from God. 
472Co 1:5 Just as we have a share in Christ's many sufferings, so also through Christ we share in God's great help. 
472Co 1:6 If we suffer, it is for your help and salvation; if we are helped, then you too are helped and given the strength to endure with patience the same sufferings that we also endure. 
472Co 1:7 So our hope in you is never shaken; we know that just as you share in our sufferings, you also share in the help we receive. 
472Co 1:8 We want to remind you, friends, of the trouble we had in the province of Asia. The burdens laid upon us were so great and so heavy that we gave up all hope of staying alive. 
472Co 1:9 We felt that the death sentence had been passed on us. But this happened so that we should rely, not on ourselves, but only on God, who raises the dead. 
472Co 1:10 From such terrible dangers of death he saved us, and will save us; and we have placed our hope in him that he will save us again, 
472Co 1:11 as you help us by means of your prayers for us. So it will be that the many prayers for us will be answered, and God will bless us; and many will raise their voices to him in thanksgiving for us. 
472Co 1:12 We are proud that our conscience assures us that our lives in this world, and especially our relations with you, have been ruled by God-given frankness and sincerity, by the power of God's grace and not by human wisdom. 
472Co 1:13 We write to you only what you can read and understand. But even though you now understand us only in part, I hope that you will come to understand us completely, 
472Co 1:14 so that in the Day of our Lord Jesus you can be as proud of us as we shall be of you. 
472Co 1:15 I was so sure of all this that I made plans at first to visit you, in order that you might be blessed twice. 
472Co 1:16 For I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back, in order to get help from you for my trip to Judea. 
472Co 1:17 In planning this, did I appear fickle? When I make my plans, do I make them from selfish motives, ready to say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time? 
472Co 1:18 As surely as God speaks the truth, my promise to you was not a "Yes" and a "No." 
472Co 1:19 For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was preached among you by Silas, Timothy, and myself, is not one who is "Yes" and "No." On the contrary, he is God's "Yes"; 
472Co 1:20 for it is he who is the "Yes" to all of God's promises. This is why through Jesus Christ our "Amen" is said to the glory of God. 
472Co 1:21 It is God himself who makes us, together with you, sure of our life in union with Christ; it is God himself who has set us apart, 
472Co 1:22 who has placed his mark of ownership upon us, and who has given us the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the guarantee of all that he has in store for us. 
472Co 1:23 I call God as my witness - he knows my heart! It was in order to spare you that I decided not to go to Corinth. 
472Co 1:24 We are not trying to dictate to you what you must believe; we know that you stand firm in the faith. Instead, we are working with you for your own happiness. 
472Co 2:1 So I made up my mind not to come to you again to make you sad. 
472Co 2:2 For if I were to make you sad, who would be left to cheer me up? Only the very persons I had made sad. 
472Co 2:3 That is why I wrote that letter to you - I did not want to come to you and be made sad by the very people who should make me glad. For I am convinced that when I am happy, then all of you are happy too. 
472Co 2:4 I wrote you with a greatly troubled and distressed heart and with many tears; my purpose was not to make you sad, but to make you realize how much I love you all. 
472Co 2:5 Now, if anyone has made somebody sad, he has not done it to me but to all of you - in part, at least. (I say this because I do not want to be too hard on him.) 
472Co 2:6 It is enough that this person has been punished in this way by most of you. 
472Co 2:7 Now, however, you should forgive him and encourage him, in order to keep him from becoming so sad as to give up completely. 
472Co 2:8 And so I beg you to let him know that you really do love him. 
472Co 2:9 I wrote you that letter because I wanted to find out how well you had stood the test and whether you are always ready to obey my instructions. 
472Co 2:10 When you forgive people for what they have done, I forgive them too. For when I forgive - if, indeed, I need to forgive anything - I do it in Christ's presence because of you, 
472Co 2:11 in order to keep Satan from getting the upper hand over us; for we know what his plans are. 
472Co 2:12 When I arrived in Troas to preach the Good News about Christ, I found that the Lord had opened the way for the work there. 
472Co 2:13 But I was deeply worried, because I could not find our brother Titus. So I said good-bye to the people there and went on to Macedonia. 
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God! For in union with Christ we are always led by God as prisoners in Christ's victory procession. God uses us to make the knowledge about Christ spread everywhere like a sweet fragrance. 
472Co 2:15 For we are like a sweet-smelling incense offered by Christ to God, which spreads among those who are being saved and those who are being lost. 
472Co 2:16 For those who are being lost, it is a deadly stench that kills; but for those who are being saved, it is a fragrance that brings life. Who, then, is capable for such a task? 
472Co 2:17 We are not like so many others, who handle God's message as if it were cheap merchandise; but because God has sent us, we speak with sincerity in his presence, as servants of Christ. 
472Co 3:1 Does this sound as if we were again boasting about ourselves? Could it be that, like some other people, we need letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
472Co 3:2 You yourselves are the letter we have, written on our hearts for everyone to know and read. 
472Co 3:3 It is clear that Christ himself wrote this letter and sent it by us. It is written, not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, and not on stone tablets but on human hearts. 
472Co 3:4 We say this because we have confidence in God through Christ. 
472Co 3:5 There is nothing in us that allows us to claim that we are capable of doing this work. The capacity we have comes from God; 
472Co 3:6 it is he who made us capable of serving the new covenant, which consists not of a written law but of the Spirit. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life. 
472Co 3:7 The Law was carved in letters on stone tablets, and God's glory appeared when it was given. Even though the brightness on Moses' face was fading, it was so strong that the people of Israel could not keep their eyes fixed on him. If the Law, which brings death when it is in force, came with such glory, 
472Co 3:8 how much greater is the glory that belongs to the activity of the Spirit! 
472Co 3:9 The system which brings condemnation was glorious; how much more glorious is the activity which brings salvation! 
472Co 3:10 We may say that because of the far brighter glory now the glory that was so bright in the past is gone. 
472Co 3:11 For if there was glory in that which lasted for a while, how much more glory is there in that which lasts forever! 
472Co 3:12 Because we have this hope, we are very bold. 
472Co 3:13 We are not like Moses, who had to put a veil over his face so that the people of Israel would not see the brightness fade and disappear. 
472Co 3:14 Their minds, indeed, were closed; and to this very day their minds are covered with the same veil as they read the books of the old covenant. The veil is removed only when a person is joined to Christ. 
472Co 3:15 Even today, whenever they read the Law of Moses, the veil still covers their minds. 
472Co 3:16 But it can be removed, as the scripture says about Moses£º "His veil was removed when he turned to the Lord." 
472Co 3:17 Now, "the Lord" in this passage is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there is freedom. 
472Co 3:18 All of us, then, reflect the glory of the Lord with uncovered faces; and that same glory, coming from the Lord, who is the Spirit, transforms us into his likeness in an ever greater degree of glory. 
472Co 4:1 God in his mercy has given us this work to do, and so we do not become discouraged. 
472Co 4:2 We put aside all secret and shameful deeds; we do not act with deceit, nor do we falsify the word of God. In the full light of truth we live in God's sight and try to commend ourselves to everyone's good conscience. 
472Co 4:3 For if the gospel we preach is hidden, it is hidden only from those who are being lost. 
472Co 4:4 They do not believe, because their minds have been kept in the dark by the evil god of this world. He keeps them from seeing the light shining on them, the light that comes from the Good News about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God. 
472Co 4:5 For it is not ourselves that we preach; we preach Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. 
472Co 4:6 The God who said, "Out of darkness the light shall shine!" is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts, to bring us the knowledge of God's glory shining in the face of Christ. 
472Co 4:7 Yet we who have this spiritual treasure are like common clay pots, in order to show that the supreme power belongs to God, not to us. 
472Co 4:8 We are often troubled, but not crushed; sometimes in doubt, but never in despair; 
472Co 4:9 there are many enemies, but we are never without a friend; and though badly hurt at times, we are not destroyed. 
472Co 4:10 At all times we carry in our mortal bodies the death of Jesus, so that his life also may be seen in our bodies. 
472Co 4:11 Throughout our lives we are always in danger of death for Jesus' sake, in order that his life may be seen in this mortal body of ours. 
472Co 4:12 This means that death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 
472Co 4:13 The scripture says, "I spoke because I believed." In the same spirit of faith we also speak because we believe. 
472Co 4:14 We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus to life, will also raise us up with Jesus and take us, together with you, into his presence. 
472Co 4:15 All this is for your sake; and as God's grace reaches more and more people, they will offer to the glory of God more prayers of thanksgiving. 
472Co 4:16 For this reason we never become discouraged. Even though our physical being is gradually decaying, yet our spiritual being is renewed day after day. 
472Co 4:17 And this small and temporary trouble we suffer will bring us a tremendous and eternal glory, much greater than the trouble. 
472Co 4:18 For we fix our attention, not on things that are seen, but on things that are unseen. What can be seen lasts only for a time, but what cannot be seen lasts forever. 
472Co 5:1 For we know that when this tent we live in - our body here on earth - is torn down, God will have a house in heaven for us to live in, a home he himself has made, which will last forever. 
472Co 5:2 And now we sigh, so great is our desire that our home which comes from heaven should be put on over us; 
472Co 5:3 by being clothed with it we shall not be without a body. 
472Co 5:4 While we live in this earthly tent, we groan with a feeling of oppression; it is not that we want to get rid of our earthly body, but that we want to have the heavenly one put on over us, so that what is mortal will be transformed by life. 
472Co 5:5 God is the one who has prepared us for this change, and he gave us his Spirit as the guarantee of all that he has in store for us. 
472Co 5:6 So we are always full of courage. We know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord's home. 
472Co 5:7 For our life is a matter of faith, not of sight. 
472Co 5:8 We are full of courage and would much prefer to leave our home in the body and be at home with the Lord. 
472Co 5:9 More than anything else, however, we want to please him, whether in our home here or there. 
472Co 5:10 For all of us must appear before Christ, to be judged by him. We will each receive what we deserve, according to everything we have done, good or bad, in our bodily life. 
472Co 5:11 We know what it means to fear the Lord, and so we try to persuade others. God knows us completely, and I hope that in your hearts you know me as well. 
472Co 5:12 We are not trying again to recommend ourselves to you; rather, we are trying to give you a good reason to be proud of us, so that you will be able to answer those who boast about people's appearance and not about their character. 
472Co 5:13 Are we really insane? It is for God's sake. Or are we sane? Then it is for your sake. 
472Co 5:14 We are ruled by the love of Christ, now that we recognize that one man died for everyone, which means that they all share in his death. 
472Co 5:15 He died for all, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but only for him who died and was raised to life for their sake. 
472Co 5:16 No longer, then, do we judge anyone by human standards. Even if at one time we judged Christ according to human standards, we no longer do so. 
472Co 5:17 Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come. 
472Co 5:18 All this is done by God, who through Christ changed us from enemies into his friends and gave us the task of making others his friends also. 
472Co 5:19 Our message is that God was making all human beings his friends through Christ. God did not keep an account of their sins, and he has given us the message which tells how he makes them his friends. 
472Co 5:20 Here we are, then, speaking for Christ, as though God himself were making his appeal through us. We plead on Christ's behalf£º let God change you from enemies into his friends! 
472Co 5:21 Christ was without sin, but for our sake God made him share our sin in order that in union with him we might share the righteousness of God. 
472Co 6:1 In our work together with God, then, we beg you who have received God's grace not to let it be wasted. 
472Co 6:2 Hear what God says£º "When the time came for me to show you favor, I heard you; when the day arrived for me to save you, I helped you." Listen! This is the hour to receive God's favor; today is the day to be saved! 
472Co 6:3 We do not want anyone to find fault with our work, so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's way. 
472Co 6:4 Instead, in everything we do we show that we are God's servants by patiently enduring troubles, hardships, and difficulties. 
472Co 6:5 We have been beaten, jailed, and mobbed; we have been overworked and have gone without sleep or food. 
472Co 6:6 By our purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness we have shown ourselves to be God's servants - by the Holy Spirit, by our true love, 
472Co 6:7 by our message of truth, and by the power of God. We have righteousness as our weapon, both to attack and to defend ourselves. 
472Co 6:8 We are honored and disgraced; we are insulted and praised. We are treated as liars, yet we speak the truth; 
472Co 6:9 as unknown, yet we are known by all; as though we were dead, but, as you see, we live on. Although punished, we are not killed; 
472Co 6:10 although saddened, we are always glad; we seem poor, but we make many people rich; we seem to have nothing, yet we really possess everything. 
472Co 6:11 Dear friends in Corinth! We have spoken frankly to you; we have opened our hearts wide. 
472Co 6:12 It is not we who have closed our hearts to you; it is you who have closed your hearts to us. 
472Co 6:13 I speak now as though you were my children£º show us the same feelings that we have for you. Open your hearts wide! 
472Co 6:14 Do not try to work together as equals with unbelievers, for it cannot be done. How can right and wrong be partners? How can light and darkness live together? 
472Co 6:15 How can Christ and the Devil agree? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? 
472Co 6:16 How can God's temple come to terms with pagan idols? For we are the temple of the living God! As God himself has said, "I will make my home with my people and live among them; I will be their God, and they shall be my people." 
472Co 6:17 And so the Lord says, "You must leave them and separate yourselves from them. Have nothing to do with what is unclean, and I will accept you. 
472Co 6:18 I will be your father, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." 
472Co 7:1 All these promises are made to us, my dear friends. So then, let us purify ourselves from everything that makes body or soul unclean, and let us be completely holy by living in awe of God. 
472Co 7:2 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one; we have ruined no one, nor tried to take advantage of anyone. 
472Co 7:3 I do not say this to condemn you; for, as I have said before, you are so dear to us that we are always together, whether we live or die. 
472Co 7:4 I am so sure of you; I take such pride in you! In all our troubles I am still full of courage; I am running over with joy. 
472Co 7:5 Even after we arrived in Macedonia, we did not have any rest. There were troubles everywhere, quarrels with others, fears in our hearts. 
472Co 7:6 But God, who encourages the downhearted, encouraged us with the coming of Titus. 
472Co 7:7 It was not only his coming that cheered us, but also his report of how you encouraged him. He told us how much you want to see me, how sorry you are, how ready you are to defend me; and so I am even happier now. 
472Co 7:8 For even if that letter of mine made you sad, I am not sorry I wrote it. I could have been sorry when I saw that it made you sad for a while. 
472Co 7:9 But now I am happy - not because I made you sad, but because your sadness made you change your ways. That sadness was used by God, and so we caused you no harm. 
472Co 7:10 For the sadness that is used by God brings a change of heart that leads to salvation - and there is no regret in that! But sadness that is merely human causes death. 
472Co 7:11 See what God did with this sadness of yours£º how earnest it has made you, how eager to prove your innocence! Such indignation, such alarm, such feelings, such devotion, such readiness to punish wrongdoing! You have shown yourselves to be without fault in the whole matter. 
472Co 7:12 So, even though I wrote that letter, it was not because of the one who did wrong or the one who was wronged. Instead, I wrote it to make plain to you, in God's sight, how deep your devotion to us really is. 
472Co 7:13 That is why we were encouraged. Not only were we encouraged; how happy Titus made us with his happiness over the way in which all of you helped to cheer him up! 
472Co 7:14 I did boast of you to him, and you have not disappointed me. We have always spoken the truth to you, and in the same way the boast we made to Titus has proved true. 
472Co 7:15 And so his love for you grows stronger, as he remembers how all of you were ready to obey his instructions, how you welcomed him with fear and trembling. 
472Co 7:16 How happy I am that I can depend on you completely! 
472Co 8:1 Our friends, we want you to know what God's grace has accomplished in the churches in Macedonia. 
472Co 8:2 They have been severely tested by the troubles they went through; but their joy was so great that they were extremely generous in their giving, even though they are very poor. 
472Co 8:3 I can assure you that they gave as much as they could, and even more than they could. Of their own free will 
472Co 8:4 they begged us and pleaded for the privilege of having a part in helping God's people in Judea. 
472Co 8:5 It was more than we could have hoped for! First they gave themselves to the Lord; and then, by God's will they gave themselves to us as well. 
472Co 8:6 So we urged Titus, who began this work, to continue it and help you complete this special service of love. 
472Co 8:7 You are so rich in all you have£º in faith, speech, and knowledge, in your eagerness to help and in your love for us. And so we want you to be generous also in this service of love. 
472Co 8:8 I am not laying down any rules. But by showing how eager others are to help, I am trying to find out how real your own love is. 
472Co 8:9 You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; rich as he was, he made himself poor for your sake, in order to make you rich by means of his poverty. 
472Co 8:10 My opinion is that it is better for you to finish now what you began last year. You were the first, not only to act, but also to be willing to act. 
472Co 8:11 On with it, then, and finish the job! Be as eager to finish it as you were to plan it, and do it with what you now have. 
472Co 8:12 If you are eager to give, God will accept your gift on the basis of what you have to give, not on what you don't have. 
472Co 8:13 I am not trying to relieve others by putting a burden on you; but since you have plenty at this time, it is only fair that you should help those who are in need.
472Co 8:14 Then, when you are in need and they have plenty, they will help you. In this way both are treated equally. 
472Co 8:15 As the scripture says, "The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little." 
472Co 8:16 How we thank God for making Titus as eager as we are to help you! 
472Co 8:17 Not only did he welcome our request; he was so eager to help that of his own free will he decided to go to you. 
472Co 8:18 With him we are sending the brother who is highly respected in all the churches for his work in preaching the gospel. 
472Co 8:19 And besides that, he has been chosen and appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this service of love for the sake of the Lord's glory and in order to show that we want to help. 
472Co 8:20 We are being careful not to stir up any complaints about the way we handle this generous gift. 
472Co 8:21 Our purpose is to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of others. 
472Co 8:22 So we are sending our brother with them; we have tested him many times and found him always very eager to help. And now that he has so much confidence in you, he is all the more eager to help. 
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and works with me to help you; as for the other brothers who are going with him, they represent the churches and bring glory to Christ. 
472Co 8:24 Show your love to them, so that all the churches will be sure of it and know that we are right in boasting about you. 
472Co 9:1 There is really no need for me to write you about the help being sent to God's people in Judea. 
472Co 9:2 I know that you are willing to help, and I have boasted of you to the people in Macedonia. "The believers in Achaia," I said, "have been ready to help since last year." Your eagerness has stirred up most of them. 
472Co 9:3 Now I am sending these believers, so that our boasting about you in this matter may not turn out to be empty words. But, just as I said, you will be ready with your help. 
472Co 9:4 However, if the people from Macedonia should come with me and find out that you are not ready, how ashamed we would be - not to speak of your shame - for feeling so sure of you! 
472Co 9:5 So I thought it was necessary to urge these believers to go to you ahead of me and get ready in advance the gift you promised to make. Then it will be ready when I arrive, and it will show that you give because you want to, not because you have to. 
472Co 9:6 Remember that the person who plants few seeds will have a small crop; the one who plants many seeds will have a large crop. 
472Co 9:7 You should each give, then, as you have decided, not with regret or out of a sense of duty; for God loves the one who gives gladly. 
472Co 9:8 And God is able to give you more than you need, so that you will always have all you need for yourselves and more than enough for every good cause. 
472Co 9:9 As the scripture says, "He gives generously to the needy; his kindness lasts forever." 
472Co 9:10 And God, who supplies seed for the sower and bread to eat, will also supply you with all the seed you need and will make it grow and produce a rich harvest from your generosity. 
472Co 9:11 He will always make you rich enough to be generous at all times, so that many will thank God for your gifts which they receive from us. 
472Co 9:12 For this service you perform not only meets the needs of God's people, but also produces an outpouring of gratitude to God. 
472Co 9:13 And because of the proof which this service of yours brings, many will give glory to God for your loyalty to the gospel of Christ, which you profess, and for your generosity in sharing with them and everyone else. 
472Co 9:14 And so with deep affection they will pray for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown you. 
472Co 9:15 Let us thank God for his priceless gift! 
472Co 10:1 I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you - I who am said to be meek and mild when I am with you, but harsh with you when I am away. By the gentleness and kindness of Christ 
472Co 10:2 I beg you not to force me to be harsh when I come; for I am sure I can deal harshly with those who say that we act from worldly motives. 
472Co 10:3 It is true that we live in the world, but we do not fight from worldly motives. 
472Co 10:4 The weapons we use in our fight are not the world's weapons but God's powerful weapons, which we use to destroy strongholds. We destroy false arguments; 
472Co 10:5 we pull down every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God; we take every thought captive and make it obey Christ. 
472Co 10:6 And after you have proved your complete loyalty, we will be ready to punish any act of disloyalty. 
472Co 10:7 You are looking at the outward appearance of things. Are there some there who reckon themselves to belong to Christ? Well, let them think again about themselves, because we belong to Christ just as much as they do. 
472Co 10:8 For I am not ashamed, even if I have boasted somewhat too much about the authority that the Lord has given us - authority to build you up, not to tear you down. 
472Co 10:9 I do not want it to appear that I am trying to frighten you with my letters. 
472Co 10:10 Someone will say, "Paul's letters are severe and strong, but when he is with us in person, he is weak, and his words are nothing!" 
472Co 10:11 Such a person must understand that there is no difference between what we write in our letters when we are away and what we will do when we are there with you. 
472Co 10:12 Of course we would not dare classify ourselves or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. How stupid they are! They make up their own standards to measure themselves by, and they judge themselves by their own standards! 
472Co 10:13 As for us, however, our boasting will not go beyond certain limits; it will stay within the limits of the work which God has set for us, and this includes our work among you. 
472Co 10:14 And since you are within those limits, we were not going beyond them when we came to you, bringing the Good News about Christ. 
472Co 10:15 So we do not boast about the work that others have done beyond the limits God set for us. Instead, we hope that your faith may grow and that we may be able to do a much greater work among you, always within the limits that God has set. 
472Co 10:16 Then we can preach the Good News in other countries beyond you and shall not have to boast about work already done in someone else's field. 
472Co 10:17 But as the scripture says, "Whoever wants to boast must boast about what the Lord has done." 
472Co 10:18 For it is when the Lord thinks well of us that we are really approved, and not when we think well of ourselves. 
472Co 11:1 I wish you would tolerate me, even when I am a bit foolish. Please do! 
472Co 11:2 I am jealous for you, just as God is; you are like a pure virgin whom I have promised in marriage to one man only, Christ himself. 
472Co 11:3 I am afraid that your minds will be corrupted and that you will abandon your full and pure devotion to Christ - in the same way that Eve was deceived by the snake's clever lies. 
472Co 11:4 For you gladly tolerate anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus, not the one we preached; and you accept a spirit and a gospel completely different from the Spirit and the gospel you received from us! 
472Co 11:5 I do not think that I am the least bit inferior to those very special so-called "apostles" of yours! 
472Co 11:6 Perhaps I am an amateur in speaking, but certainly not in knowledge; we have made this clear to you at all times and in all conditions. 
472Co 11:7 I did not charge you a thing when I preached the Good News of God to you; I humbled myself in order to make you important. Was that wrong of me? 
472Co 11:8 While I was working among you, I was paid by other churches. I was robbing them, so to speak, in order to help you. 
472Co 11:9 And during the time I was with you I did not bother you for help when I needed money; the believers who came from Macedonia brought me everything I needed. As in the past, so in the future£º I will never be a burden to you! 
472Co 11:10 By Christ's truth in me, I promise that this boast of mine will not be silenced anywhere in all of Achaia. 
472Co 11:11 Do I say this because I don't love you? God knows I love you! 
472Co 11:12 I will go on doing what I am doing now, in order to keep those other "apostles" from having any reason for boasting and saying that they work in the same way that we do. 
472Co 11:13 Those men are not true apostles - they are false apostles, who lie about their work and disguise themselves to look like real apostles of Christ. 
472Co 11:14 Well, no wonder! Even Satan can disguise himself to look like an angel of light! 
472Co 11:15 So it is no great thing if his servants disguise themselves to look like servants of righteousness. In the end they will get exactly what their actions deserve. 
472Co 11:16 I repeat£º no one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, at least accept me as a fool, just so I will have a little to boast of. 
472Co 11:17 Of course what I am saying now is not what the Lord would have me say; in this matter of boasting I am really talking like a fool. 
472Co 11:18 But since there are so many who boast for merely human reasons, I will do the same. 
472Co 11:19 You yourselves are so wise, and so you gladly tolerate fools! 
472Co 11:20 You tolerate anyone who orders you around or takes advantage of you or traps you or looks down on you or slaps you in the face. 
472Co 11:21 I am ashamed to admit that we were too timid to do those things! But if anyone dares to boast about something - I am talking like a fool - I will be just as daring. 
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. 
472Co 11:23 Are they Christ's servants? I sound like a madman - but I am a better servant than they are! I have worked much harder, I have been in prison more times, I have been whipped much more, and I have been near death more often. 
472Co 11:24 Five times I was given the thirty-nine lashes by the Jews; 
472Co 11:25 three times I was whipped by the Romans; and once I was stoned. I have been in three shipwrecks, and once I spent twenty-four hours in the water. 
472Co 11:26 In my many travels I have been in danger from floods and from robbers, in danger from my own people and from Gentiles; there have been dangers in the cities, dangers in the wilds, dangers on the high seas, and dangers from false friends. 
472Co 11:27 There has been work and toil; often I have gone without sleep; I have been hungry and thirsty; I have often been without enough food, shelter, or clothing. 
472Co 11:28 And not to mention other things, every day I am under the pressure of my concern for all the churches. 
472Co 11:29 When someone is weak, then I feel weak too; when someone is led into sin, I am filled with distress. 
472Co 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast about things that show how weak I am. 
472Co 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus - blessed be his name forever! - knows that I am not lying. 
472Co 11:32 When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas placed guards at the city gates to arrest me. 
472Co 11:33 But I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him. 
472Co 12:1 I have to boast, even though it doesn't do any good. But I will now talk about visions and revelations given me by the Lord. 
472Co 12:2 I know a certain Christian man who fourteen years ago was snatched up to the highest heaven (I do not know whether this actually happened or whether he had a vision - only God knows). 
472Co 12:3 I repeat, I know that this man was snatched to Paradise (again, I do not know whether this actually happened or whether it was a vision - only God knows), 
472Co 12:4 and there he heard things which cannot be put into words, things that human lips may not speak. 
472Co 12:5 So I will boast about this man - but I will not boast about myself, except the things that show how weak I am. 
472Co 12:6 If I wanted to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I will not boast, because I do not want any of you to have a higher opinion of me than you have as a result of what you have seen me do and heard me say. 
472Co 12:7 But to keep me from being puffed up with pride because of the many wonderful things I saw, I was given a painful physical ailment, which acts as Satan's messenger to beat me and keep me from being proud. 
472Co 12:8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about this and asked him to take it away. 
472Co 12:9 But his answer was£º "My grace is all you need, for my power is greatest when you are weak." I am most happy, then, to be proud of my weaknesses, in order to feel the protection of Christ's power over me. 
472Co 12:10 I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 
472Co 12:11 I am acting like a fool - but you have made me do it. You are the ones who ought to show your approval of me. For even if I am nothing, I am in no way inferior to those very special "apostles" of yours. 
472Co 12:12 The many miracles and wonders that prove that I am an apostle were performed among you with much patience. 
472Co 12:13 How were you treated any worse than the other churches, except that I did not bother you for financial help? Please forgive me for being so unfair! 
472Co 12:14 This is now the third time that I am ready to come to visit you - and I will not make any demands on you. It is you I want, not your money. After all, children should not have to provide for their parents, but parents should provide for their children. 
472Co 12:15 I will be glad to spend all I have, and myself as well, in order to help you. Will you love me less because I love you so much? 
472Co 12:16 You will agree, then, that I was not a burden to you. But someone will say that I was tricky, and trapped you with lies. 
472Co 12:17 How? Did I take advantage of you through any of the messengers I sent? 
472Co 12:18 I begged Titus to go, and I sent the other believer with him. Would you say that Titus took advantage of you? Do not he and I act from the very same motives and behave in the same way? 
472Co 12:19 Perhaps you think that all along we have been trying to defend ourselves before you. No! We speak as Christ would have us speak in the presence of God, and everything we do, dear friends, is done to help you. 
472Co 12:20 I am afraid that when I get there I will find you different from what I would like you to be and you will find me different from what you would like me to be. I am afraid that I will find quarreling and jealousy, hot tempers and selfishness, insults and gossip, pride and disorder. 
472Co 12:21 I am afraid that the next time I come my God will humiliate me in your presence, and I shall weep over many who sinned in the past and have not repented of the immoral things they have done - their lust and their sexual sins. 
472Co 13:1 This is now the third time that I am coming to visit you. "Any accusation must be upheld by the evidence of two or more witnesses" - as the scripture says. 
472Co 13:2 I want to tell those of you who have sinned in the past, and all the others; I said it before during my second visit to you, but I will say it again now that I am away£º the next time I come nobody will escape punishment. 
472Co 13:3 You will have all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me. When he deals with you, he is not weak; instead, he shows his power among you. 
472Co 13:4 For even though it was in weakness that he was put to death on the cross, it is by God's power that he lives. In union with him we also are weak; but in our relations with you we shall share God's power in his life. 
472Co 13:5 Put yourselves to the test and judge yourselves, to find out whether you are living in faith. Surely you know that Christ Jesus is in you? - unless you have completely failed. 
472Co 13:6 I trust you will know that we are not failures. 
472Co 13:7 We pray to God that you will do no wrong - not in order to show that we are a success, but so that you may do what is right, even though we may seem to be failures. 
472Co 13:8 For we cannot do a thing against the truth, but only for it. 
472Co 13:9 We are glad when we are weak but you are strong. And so we also pray that you will become perfect. 
472Co 13:10 That is why I write this while I am away from you; it is so that when I arrive I will not have to deal harshly with you in using the authority that the Lord has given me - authority to build you up, not to tear you down. 
472Co 13:11 And now, my friends, good-bye! Strive for perfection; listen to my appeals; agree with one another; live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you. 
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with the kiss of peace. 
472Co 13:13 All of God's people send you their greetings.

48Gl 1:1 From Paul, whose call to be an apostle did not come from human beings or by human means, but from Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from death. 
48Gl 1:2 All the believers who are here join me in sending greetings to the churches of Galatia£º 
48Gl 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
48Gl 1:4 In order to set us free from this present evil age, Christ gave himself for our sins, in obedience to the will of our God and Father. 
48Gl 1:5 To God be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 
48Gl 1:6 I am surprised at you! In no time at all you are deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ, and are accepting another gospel. 
48Gl 1:7 Actually, there is no "other gospel," but I say this because there are some people who are upsetting you and trying to change the gospel of Christ. 
48Gl 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel that is different from the one we preached to you, may he be condemned to hell! 
48Gl 1:9 We have said it before, and now I say it again£º if anyone preaches to you a gospel that is different from the one you accepted, may he be condemned to hell! 
48Gl 1:10 Does this sound as if I am trying to win human approval? No indeed! What I want is God's approval! Am I trying to be popular with people? If I were still trying to do so, I would not be a servant of Christ. 
48Gl 1:11 Let me tell you, my friends, that the gospel I preach is not of human origin. 
48Gl 1:12 I did not receive it from any human being, nor did anyone teach it to me. It was Jesus Christ himself who revealed it to me. 
48Gl 1:13 You have been told how I used to live when I was devoted to the Jewish religion, how I persecuted without mercy the church of God and did my best to destroy it. 
48Gl 1:14 I was ahead of most other Jews of my age in my practice of the Jewish religion, and was much more devoted to the traditions of our ancestors. 
48Gl 1:15 But God in his grace chose me even before I was born, and called me to serve him. And when he decided 
48Gl 1:16 to reveal his Son to me, so that I might preach the Good News about him to the Gentiles, I did not go to anyone for advice, 
48Gl 1:17 nor did I go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went at once to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus. 
48Gl 1:18 It was three years later that I went to Jerusalem to obtain information from Peter, and I stayed with him for two weeks. 
48Gl 1:19 I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother. 
48Gl 1:20 What I write is true. God knows that I am not lying! 
48Gl 1:21 Afterward I went to places in Syria and Cilicia. 
48Gl 1:22 At that time the members of the churches in Judea did not know me personally. 
48Gl 1:23 They knew only what others were saying£º "The man who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy!" 
48Gl 1:24 And so they praised God because of me. 
48Gl 2:1 Fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. 
48Gl 2:2 I went because God revealed to me that I should go. In a private meeting with the leaders I explained the gospel message that I preach to the Gentiles. I did not want my work in the past or in the present to be a failure. 
48Gl 2:3 My companion Titus, even though he is Greek, was not forced to be circumcised, 
48Gl 2:4 although some wanted it done. Pretending to be believers, these men slipped into our group as spies, in order to find out about the freedom we have through our union with Christ Jesus. They wanted to make slaves of us, 
48Gl 2:5 but in order to keep the truth of the gospel safe for you, we did not give in to them for a minute. 
48Gl 2:6 But those who seemed to be the leaders - I say this because it makes no difference to me what they were; God does not judge by outward appearances - those leaders, I say, made no new suggestions to me. 
48Gl 2:7 On the contrary, they saw that God had given me the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the task of preaching the gospel to the Jews. 
48Gl 2:8 For by God's power I was made an apostle to the Gentiles, just as Peter was made an apostle to the Jews. 
48Gl 2:9 James, Peter, and John, who seemed to be the leaders, recognized that God had given me this special task; so they shook hands with Barnabas and me, as a sign that we were all partners. We agreed that Barnabas and I would work among the Gentiles and they among the Jews. 
48Gl 2:10 All they asked was that we should remember the needy in their group, which is the very thing I have been eager to do. 
48Gl 2:11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him in public, because he was clearly wrong. 
48Gl 2:12 Before some men who had been sent by James arrived there, Peter had been eating with the Gentile believers. But after these men arrived, he drew back and would not eat with the Gentiles, because he was afraid of those who were in favor of circumcising them. 
48Gl 2:13 The other Jewish believers also started acting like cowards along with Peter; and even Barnabas was swept along by their cowardly action. 
48Gl 2:14 When I saw that they were not walking a straight path in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you have been living like a Gentile, not like a Jew. How, then, can you try to force Gentiles to live like Jews?" 
48Gl 2:15 Indeed, we are Jews by birth and not "Gentile sinners," as they are called. 
48Gl 2:16 Yet we know that a person is put right with God only through faith in Jesus Christ, never by doing what the Law requires. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be put right with God through our faith in Christ, and not by doing what the Law requires. For no one is put right with God by doing what the Law requires. 
48Gl 2:17 If, then, as we try to be put right with God by our union with Christ, we are found to be sinners, as much as the Gentiles are - does this mean that Christ is serving the cause of sin? By no means! 
48Gl 2:18 If I start to rebuild the system of Law that I tore down, then I show myself to be someone who breaks the Law. 
48Gl 2:19 So far as the Law is concerned, however, I am dead - killed by the Law itself - in order that I might live for God. I have been put to death with Christ on his cross, 
48Gl 2:20 so that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. This life that I live now, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me. 
48Gl 2:21 I refuse to reject the grace of God. But if a person is put right with God through the Law, it means that Christ died for nothing! 
48Gl 3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who put a spell on you? Before your very eyes you had a clear description of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross! 
48Gl 3:2 Tell me this one thing£º did you receive God's Spirit by doing what the Law requires or by hearing the gospel and believing it? 
48Gl 3:3 How can you be so foolish! You began by God's Spirit; do you now want to finish by your own power? 
48Gl 3:4 Did all your experience mean nothing at all? Surely it meant something! 
48Gl 3:5 Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do what the Law requires or because you hear the gospel and believe it? 
48Gl 3:6 Consider the experience of Abraham; as the scripture says, "He believed God, and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous." 
48Gl 3:7 You should realize, then, that the real descendants of Abraham are the people who have faith. 
48Gl 3:8 The scripture predicted that God would put the Gentiles right with himself through faith. And so the scripture announced the Good News to Abraham£º "Through you God will bless all people." 
48Gl 3:9 Abraham believed and was blessed; so all who believe are blessed as he was. 
48Gl 3:10 Those who depend on obeying the Law live under a curse. For the scripture says, "Whoever does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the Law is under God's curse!" 
48Gl 3:11 Now, it is clear that no one is put right with God by means of the Law, because the scripture says, "Only the person who is put right with God through faith shall live." 
48Gl 3:12 But the Law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, as the scripture says, "Whoever {\I does everything the Law requires will live."
48Gl 3:13 But by becoming a curse for us Christ has redeemed us from the curse that the Law brings; for the scripture says, "Anyone who is hanged on a tree is under God's curse." 
48Gl 3:14 Christ did this in order that the blessing which God promised to Abraham might be given to the Gentiles by means of Christ Jesus, so that through faith we might receive the Spirit promised by God. 
48Gl 3:15 My friends, I am going to use an everyday example£º when two people agree on a matter and sign an agreement, no one can break it or add anything to it. 
48Gl 3:16 Now, God made his promises to Abraham and to his descendant. The scripture does not use the plural "descendants," meaning many people, but the singular "descendant," meaning one person only, namely, Christ. 
48Gl 3:17 What I mean is that God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to keep it. The Law, which was given four hundred and thirty years later, cannot break that covenant and cancel God's promise. 
48Gl 3:18 For if God's gift depends on the Law, then it no longer depends on his promise. However, it was because of his promise that God gave that gift to Abraham. 
48Gl 3:19 What, then, was the purpose of the Law? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is, and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant, to whom the promise was made. The Law was handed down by angels, with a man acting as a go-between. 
48Gl 3:20 But a go-between is not needed when only one person is involved; and God is one. 
48Gl 3:21 Does this mean that the Law is against God's promises? No, not at all! For if human beings had received a law that could bring life, then everyone could be put right with God by obeying it. 
48Gl 3:22 But the scripture says that the whole world is under the power of sin; and so the gift which is promised on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ is given to those who believe. 
48Gl 3:23 But before the time for faith came, the Law kept us all locked up as prisoners until this coming faith should be revealed. 
48Gl 3:24 And so the Law was in charge of us until Christ came, in order that we might then be put right with God through faith. 
48Gl 3:25 Now that the time for faith is here, the Law is no longer in charge of us. 
48Gl 3:26 It is through faith that all of you are God's children in union with Christ Jesus. 
48Gl 3:27 You were baptized into union with Christ, and now you are clothed, so to speak, with the life of Christ himself. 
48Gl 3:28 So there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles, between slaves and free people, between men and women; you are all one in union with Christ Jesus. 
48Gl 3:29 If you belong to Christ, then you are the descendants of Abraham and will receive what God has promised. 
48Gl 4:1 But now to continue - the son who will receive his father's property is treated just like a slave while he is young, even though he really owns everything. 
48Gl 4:2 While he is young, there are men who take care of him and manage his affairs until the time set by his father. 
48Gl 4:3 In the same way, we too were slaves of the ruling spirits of the universe before we reached spiritual maturity. 
48Gl 4:4 But when the right time finally came, God sent his own Son. He came as the son of a human mother and lived under the Jewish Law, 
48Gl 4:5 to redeem those who were under the Law, so that we might become God's children. 
48Gl 4:6 To show that you are his children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who cries out, "Father, my Father." 
48Gl 4:7 So then, you are no longer a slave but a child. And since you are his child, God will give you all that he has for his children. 
48Gl 4:8 In the past you did not know God, and so you were slaves of beings who are not gods. 
48Gl 4:9 But now that you know God - or, I should say, now that God knows you - how is it that you want to turn back to those weak and pitiful ruling spirits? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again? 
48Gl 4:10 You pay special attention to certain days, months, seasons, and years. 
48Gl 4:11 I am worried about you! Can it be that all my work for you has been for nothing? 
48Gl 4:12 I beg you, my friends, be like me. After all, I am like you. You have not done me any wrong. 
48Gl 4:13 You remember why I preached the gospel to you the first time; it was because I was sick. 
48Gl 4:14 But even though my physical condition was a great trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you received me as you would an angel from heaven; you received me as you would Christ Jesus. 
48Gl 4:15 You were so happy! What has happened? I myself can say that you would have taken out your own eyes, if you could, and given them to me. 
48Gl 4:16 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? 
48Gl 4:17 Those other people show a deep interest in you, but their intentions are not good. All they want is to separate you from me, so that you will have the same interest in them as they have in you. 
48Gl 4:18 Now, it is good to have such a deep interest if the purpose is good - this is true always, and not merely when I am with you. 
48Gl 4:19 My dear children! Once again, just like a mother in childbirth, I feel the same kind of pain for you until Christ's nature is formed in you. 
48Gl 4:20 How I wish I were with you now, so that I could take a different attitude toward you. I am so worried about you! 
48Gl 4:21 Let me ask those of you who want to be subject to the Law£º do you not hear what the Law says? 
48Gl 4:22 It says that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman, the other by a free woman. 
48Gl 4:23 His son by the slave woman was born in the usual way, but his son by the free woman was born as a result of God's promise. 
48Gl 4:24 These things can be understood as a figure£º the two women represent two covenants. The one whose children are born in slavery is Hagar, and she represents the covenant made at Mount Sinai. 
48Gl 4:25 Hagar, who stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, is a figure of the present city of Jerusalem, in slavery with all its people. 
48Gl 4:26 But the heavenly Jerusalem is free, and she is our mother. 
48Gl 4:27 For the scripture says, "Be happy, you childless woman! Shout and cry with joy, you who never felt the pains of childbirth! For the woman who was deserted will have more children than the woman whose husband never left her." 
48Gl 4:28 Now, you, my friends, are God's children as a result of his promise, just as Isaac was. 
48Gl 4:29 At that time the son who was born in the usual way persecuted the one who was born because of God's Spirit; and it is the same now. 
48Gl 4:30 But what does the scripture say? It says, "Send the slave woman and her son away; for the son of the slave woman will not have a part of the father's property along with the son of the free woman." 
48Gl 4:31 So then, my friends, we are not the children of a slave woman but of a free woman. 
48Gl 5:1 Freedom is what we have - Christ has set us free! Stand, then, as free people, and do not allow yourselves to become slaves again. 
48Gl 5:2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, it means that Christ is of no use to you at all. 
48Gl 5:3 Once more I warn any man who allows himself to be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the whole Law. 
48Gl 5:4 Those of you who try to be put right with God by obeying the Law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You are outside God's grace. 
48Gl 5:5 As for us, our hope is that God will put us right with him; and this is what we wait for by the power of God's Spirit working through our faith. 
48Gl 5:6 For when we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor the lack of it makes any difference at all; what matters is faith that works through love. 
48Gl 5:7 You were doing so well! Who made you stop obeying the truth? How did he persuade you? 
48Gl 5:8 It was not done by God, who calls you. 
48Gl 5:9 "It takes only a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise," as they say. 
48Gl 5:10 But I still feel confident about you. Our life in union with the Lord makes me confident that you will not take a different view and that whoever is upsetting you will be punished by God. 
48Gl 5:11 But as for me, my friends, if I continue to preach that circumcision is necessary, why am I still being persecuted? If that were true, then my preaching about the cross of Christ would cause no trouble. 
48Gl 5:12 I wish that the people who are upsetting you would go all the way; let them go on and castrate themselves! 
48Gl 5:13 As for you, my friends, you were called to be free. But do not let this freedom become an excuse for letting your physical desires control you. Instead, let love make you serve one another. 
48Gl 5:14 For the whole Law is summed up in one commandment£º "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." 
48Gl 5:15 But if you act like wild animals, hurting and harming each other, then watch out, or you will completely destroy one another. 
48Gl 5:16 What I say is this£º let the Spirit direct your lives, and you will not satisfy the desires of the human nature. 
48Gl 5:17 For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the Spirit wants, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants. These two are enemies, and this means that you cannot do what you want to do. 
48Gl 5:18 If the Spirit leads you, then you are not subject to the Law. 
48Gl 5:19 What human nature does is quite plain. It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions; 
48Gl 5:20 in worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups; 
48Gl 5:21 they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before£º those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God. 
48Gl 5:22 But the Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
48Gl 5:23 humility, and self-control. There is no law against such things as these. 
48Gl 5:24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have put to death their human nature with all its passions and desires. 
48Gl 5:25 The Spirit has given us life; he must also control our lives. 
48Gl 5:26 We must not be proud or irritate one another or be jealous of one another. 
48Gl 6:1 My friends, if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should set him right; but you must do it in a gentle way. And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too. 
48Gl 6:2 Help carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will obey the law of Christ. 
48Gl 6:3 If you think you are something when you really are nothing, you are only deceiving yourself. 
48Gl 6:4 You should each judge your own conduct. If it is good, then you can be proud of what you yourself have done, without having to compare it with what someone else has done. 
48Gl 6:5 For each of you have to carry your own load. 
48Gl 6:6 If you are being taught the Christian message, you should share all the good things you have with your teacher. 
48Gl 6:7 Do not deceive yourselves; no one makes a fool of God. You will reap exactly what you plant. 
48Gl 6:8 If you plant in the field of your natural desires, from it you will gather the harvest of death; if you plant in the field of the Spirit, from the Spirit you will gather the harvest of eternal life. 
48Gl 6:9 So let us not become tired of doing good; for if we do not give up, the time will come when we will reap the harvest. 
48Gl 6:10 So then, as often as we have the chance, we should do good to everyone, and especially to those who belong to our family in the faith. 
48Gl 6:11 See what big letters I make as I write to you now with my own hand! 
48Gl 6:12 The people who are trying to force you to be circumcised are the ones who want to show off and boast about external matters. They do it, however, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
48Gl 6:13 Even those who practice circumcision do not obey the Law; they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you submitted to this physical ceremony. 
48Gl 6:14 As for me, however, I will boast only about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of his cross the world is dead to me, and I am dead to the world. 
48Gl 6:15 It does not matter at all whether or not one is circumcised; what does matter is being a new creature. 
48Gl 6:16 As for those who follow this rule in their lives, may peace and mercy be with them - with them and with all of God's people! 
48Gl 6:17 To conclude£º let no one give me any more trouble, because the scars I have on my body show that I am the slave of Jesus. 
48Gl 6:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, my friends. Amen. 
49
49Eph 1:1 From Paul, who by God's will is an apostle of Christ Jesus - To God's people in Ephesus, who are faithful in their life in union with Christ Jesus£º 
49Eph 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
49Eph 1:3 Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! For in our union with Christ he has blessed us by giving us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world. 
49Eph 1:4 Even before the world was made, God had already chosen us to be his through our union with Christ, so that we would be holy and without fault before him. Because of his love 
49Eph 1:5 God had already decided that through Jesus Christ he would make us his children - this was his pleasure and purpose. 
49Eph 1:6 Let us praise God for his glorious grace, for the free gift he gave us in his dear Son! 
49Eph 1:7 For by the blood of Christ we are set free, that is, our sins are forgiven. How great is the grace of God, 
49Eph 1:8 which he gave to us in such large measure! In all his wisdom and insight 
49Eph 1:9 God did what he had purposed, and made known to us the secret plan he had already decided to complete by means of Christ. 
49Eph 1:10 This plan, which God will complete when the time is right, is to bring all creation together, everything in heaven and on earth, with Christ as head. 
49Eph 1:11 All things are done according to God's plan and decision; and God chose us to be his own people in union with Christ because of his own purpose, based on what he had decided from the very beginning. 
49Eph 1:12 Let us, then, who were the first to hope in Christ, praise God's glory! 
49Eph 1:13 And you also became God's people when you heard the true message, the Good News that brought you salvation. You believed in Christ, and God put his stamp of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit he had promised. 
49Eph 1:14 The Spirit is the guarantee that we shall receive what God has promised his people, and this assures us that God will give complete freedom to those who are his. Let us praise his glory! 
49Eph 1:15 For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God's people, 
49Eph 1:16 I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you. I remember you in my prayers 
49Eph 1:17 and ask the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, to give you the Spirit, who will make you wise and reveal God to you, so that you will know him. 
49Eph 1:18 I ask that your minds may be opened to see his light, so that you will know what is the hope to which he has called you, how rich are the wonderful blessings he promises his people, 
49Eph 1:19 and how very great is his power at work in us who believe. This power working in us is the same as the mighty strength 
49Eph 1:20 which he used when he raised Christ from death and seated him at his right side in the heavenly world. 
49Eph 1:21 Christ rules there above all heavenly rulers, authorities, powers, and lords; he has a title superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next. 
49Eph 1:22 God put all things under Christ's feet and gave him to the church as supreme Lord over all things. 
49Eph 1:23 The church is Christ's body, the completion of him who himself completes all things everywhere. 
49Eph 2:1 In the past you were spiritually dead because of your disobedience and sins. 
49Eph 2:2 At that time you followed the world's evil way; you obeyed the ruler of the spiritual powers in space, the spirit who now controls the people who disobey God. 
49Eph 2:3 Actually all of us were like them and lived according to our natural desires, doing whatever suited the wishes of our own bodies and minds. In our natural condition we, like everyone else, were destined to suffer God's anger. 
49Eph 2:4 But God's mercy is so abundant, and his love for us is so great, 
49Eph 2:5 that while we were spiritually dead in our disobedience he brought us to life with Christ. It is by God's grace that you have been saved. 
49Eph 2:6 In our union with Christ Jesus he raised us up with him to rule with him in the heavenly world. 
49Eph 2:7 He did this to demonstrate for all time to come the extraordinary greatness of his grace in the love he showed us in Christ Jesus. 
49Eph 2:8 For it is by God's grace that you have been saved through faith. It is not the result of your own efforts, 
49Eph 2:9 but God's gift, so that no one can boast about it. 
49Eph 2:10 God has made us what we are, and in our union with Christ Jesus he has created us for a life of good deeds, which he has already prepared for us to do. 
49Eph 2:11 You Gentiles by birth - called "the uncircumcised" by the Jews, who call themselves the circumcised (which refers to what men do to their bodies) - remember what you were in the past. 
49Eph 2:12 At that time you were apart from Christ. You were foreigners and did not belong to God's chosen people. You had no part in the covenants, which were based on God's promises to his people, and you lived in this world without hope and without God. 
49Eph 2:13 But now, in union with Christ Jesus you, who used to be far away, have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
49Eph 2:14 For Christ himself has brought us peace by making Jews and Gentiles one people. With his own body he broke down the wall that separated them and kept them enemies. 
49Eph 2:15 He abolished the Jewish Law with its commandments and rules, in order to create out of the two races one new people in union with himself, in this way making peace. 
49Eph 2:16 By his death on the cross Christ destroyed their enmity; by means of the cross he united both races into one body and brought them back to God. 
49Eph 2:17 So Christ came and preached the Good News of peace to all - to you Gentiles, who were far away from God, and to the Jews, who were near to him. 
49Eph 2:18 It is through Christ that all of us, Jews and Gentiles, are able to come in the one Spirit into the presence of the Father. 
49Eph 2:19 So then, you Gentiles are not foreigners or strangers any longer; you are now citizens together with God's people and members of the family of God. 
49Eph 2:20 You, too, are built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, the cornerstone being Christ Jesus himself. 
49Eph 2:21 He is the one who holds the whole building together and makes it grow into a sacred temple dedicated to the Lord. 
49Eph 2:22 In union with him you too are being built together with all the others into a place where God lives through his Spirit. 
49Eph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, pray to God. 
49Eph 3:2 Surely you have heard that God in his grace has given me this work to do for your good. 
49Eph 3:3 God revealed his secret plan and made it known to me. (I have written briefly about this, 
49Eph 3:4 and if you will read what I have written, you can learn about my understanding of the secret of Christ.) 
49Eph 3:5 In past times human beings were not told this secret, but God has revealed it now by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets. 
49Eph 3:6 The secret is that by means of the gospel the Gentiles have a part with the Jews in God's blessings; they are members of the same body and share in the promise that God made through Christ Jesus. 
49Eph 3:7 I was made a servant of the gospel by God's special gift, which he gave me through the working of his power. 
49Eph 3:8 I am less than the least of all God's people; yet God gave me this privilege of taking to the Gentiles the Good News about the infinite riches of Christ, 
49Eph 3:9 and of making all people see how God's secret plan is to be put into effect. God, who is the Creator of all things, kept his secret hidden through all the past ages, 
49Eph 3:10 in order that at the present time, by means of the church, the angelic rulers and powers in the heavenly world might learn of his wisdom in all its different forms. 
49Eph 3:11 God did this according to his eternal purpose, which he achieved through Christ Jesus our Lord. 
49Eph 3:12 In union with Christ and through our faith in him we have the boldness to go into God's presence with all confidence. 
49Eph 3:13 I beg you, then, not to be discouraged because I am suffering for you; it is all for your benefit. 
49Eph 3:14 For this reason I fall on my knees before the Father, 
49Eph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its true name. 
49Eph 3:16 I ask God from the wealth of his glory to give you power through his Spirit to be strong in your inner selves, 
49Eph 3:17 and I pray that Christ will make his home in your hearts through faith. I pray that you may have your roots and foundation in love, 
49Eph 3:18 so that you, together with all God's people, may have the power to understand how broad and long, how high and deep, is Christ's love. 
49Eph 3:19 Yes, may you come to know his love - although it can never be fully known - and so be completely filled with the very nature of God. 
49Eph 3:20 To him who by means of his power working in us is able to do so much more than we can ever ask for, or even think of£º 
49Eph 3:21 to God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time, forever and ever! Amen. 
49Eph 4:1 I urge you, then - I who am a prisoner because I serve the Lord£º live a life that measures up to the standard God set when he called you. 
49Eph 4:2 Be always humble, gentle, and patient. Show your love by being tolerant with one another. 
49Eph 4:3 Do your best to preserve the unity which the Spirit gives by means of the peace that binds you together. 
49Eph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as there is one hope to which God has called you. 
49Eph 4:5 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
49Eph 4:6 there is one God and Father of all people, who is Lord of all, works through all, and is in all. 
49Eph 4:7 Each one of us has received a special gift in proportion to what Christ has given. 
49Eph 4:8 As the scripture says, "When he went up to the very heights, he took many captives with him; he gave gifts to people." 
49Eph 4:9 Now, what does "he went up" mean? It means that first he came down to the lowest depths of the earth. 
49Eph 4:10 So the one who came down is the same one who went up, above and beyond the heavens, to fill the whole universe with his presence. 
49Eph 4:11 It was he who "gave gifts to people"; he appointed some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, others to be pastors and teachers. 
49Eph 4:12 He did this to prepare all God's people for the work of Christian service, in order to build up the body of Christ. 
49Eph 4:13 And so we shall all come together to that oneness in our faith and in our knowledge of the Son of God; we shall become mature people, reaching to the very height of Christ's full stature. 
49Eph 4:14 Then we shall no longer be children, carried by the waves and blown about by every shifting wind of the teaching of deceitful people, who lead others into error by the tricks they invent. 
49Eph 4:15 Instead, by speaking the truth in a spirit of love, we must grow up in every way to Christ, who is the head. 
49Eph 4:16 Under his control all the different parts of the body fit together, and the whole body is held together by every joint with which it is provided. So when each separate part works as it should, the whole body grows and builds itself up through love. 
49Eph 4:17 In the Lord's name, then, I warn you£º do not continue to live like the heathen, whose thoughts are worthless 
49Eph 4:18 and whose minds are in the dark. They have no part in the life that God gives, for they are completely ignorant and stubborn. 
49Eph 4:19 They have lost all feeling of shame; they give themselves over to vice and do all sorts of indecent things without restraint. 
49Eph 4:20 That was not what you learned about Christ! 
49Eph 4:21 You certainly heard about him, and as his followers you were taught the truth that is in Jesus. 
49Eph 4:22 So get rid of your old self, which made you live as you used to - the old self that was being destroyed by its deceitful desires. 
49Eph 4:23 Your hearts and minds must be made completely new, 
49Eph 4:24 and you must put on the new self, which is created in God's likeness and reveals itself in the true life that is upright and holy. 
49Eph 4:25 No more lying, then! Each of you must tell the truth to the other believer, because we are all members together in the body of Christ. 
49Eph 4:26 If you become angry, do not let your anger lead you into sin, and do not stay angry all day. 
49Eph 4:27 Don't give the Devil a chance. 
49Eph 4:28 If you used to rob, you must stop robbing and start working, in order to earn an honest living for yourself and to be able to help the poor. 
49Eph 4:29 Do not use harmful words, but only helpful words, the kind that build up and provide what is needed, so that what you say will do good to those who hear you. 
49Eph 4:30 And do not make God's Holy Spirit sad; for the Spirit is God's mark of ownership on you, a guarantee that the Day will come when God will set you free. 
49Eph 4:31 Get rid of all bitterness, passion, and anger. No more shouting or insults, no more hateful feelings of any sort. 
49Eph 4:32 Instead, be kind and tender-hearted to one another, and forgive one another, as God has forgiven you through Christ. 
49Eph 5:1 Since you are God's dear children, you must try to be like him. 
49Eph 5:2 Your life must be controlled by love, just as Christ loved us and gave his life for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God. 
49Eph 5:3 Since you are God's people, it is not right that any matters of sexual immorality or indecency or greed should even be mentioned among you. 
49Eph 5:4 Nor is it fitting for you to use language which is obscene, profane, or vulgar. Rather you should give thanks to God. 
49Eph 5:5 You may be sure that no one who is immoral, indecent, or greedy (for greed is a form of idolatry) will ever receive a share in the Kingdom of Christ and of God. 
49Eph 5:6 Do not let anyone deceive you with foolish words; it is because of these very things that God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him. 
49Eph 5:7 So have nothing at all to do with such people. 
49Eph 5:8 You yourselves used to be in the darkness, but since you have become the Lord's people, you are in the light. So you must live like people who belong to the light, 
49Eph 5:9 for it is the light that brings a rich harvest of every kind of goodness, righteousness, and truth. 
49Eph 5:10 Try to learn what pleases the Lord. 
49Eph 5:11 Have nothing to do with the worthless things that people do, things that belong to the darkness. Instead, bring them out to the light. 
49Eph 5:12 (It is really too shameful even to talk about the things they do in secret.) 
49Eph 5:13 And when all things are brought out to the light, then their true nature is clearly revealed; 
49Eph 5:14 for anything that is clearly revealed becomes light. That is why it is said, "Wake up, sleeper, and rise from death, and Christ will shine on you." 
49Eph 5:15 So be careful how you live. Don't live like ignorant people, but like wise people. 
49Eph 5:16 Make good use of every opportunity you have, because these are evil days. 
49Eph 5:17 Don't be fools, then, but try to find out what the Lord wants you to do. 
49Eph 5:18 Do not get drunk with wine, which will only ruin you; instead, be filled with the Spirit. 
49Eph 5:19 Speak to one another with the words of psalms, hymns, and sacred songs; sing hymns and psalms to the Lord with praise in your hearts. 
49Eph 5:20 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, always give thanks for everything to God the Father. 
49Eph 5:21 Submit yourselves to one another because of your reverence for Christ. 
49Eph 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord. 
49Eph 5:23 For a husband has authority over his wife just as Christ has authority over the church; and Christ is himself the Savior of the church, his body. 
49Eph 5:24 And so wives must submit themselves completely to their husbands just as the church submits itself to Christ. 
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it. 
49Eph 5:26 He did this to dedicate the church to God by his word, after making it clean by washing it in water, 
49Eph 5:27 in order to present the church to himself in all its beauty - pure and faultless, without spot or wrinkle or any other imperfection. 
49Eph 5:28 Men ought to love their wives just as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself. 
49Eph 5:29 (None of us ever hate our own bodies. Instead, we feed them, and take care of them, just as Christ does the church; 
49Eph 5:30 for we are members of his body.) 
49Eph 5:31 As the scripture says, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, and the two will become one." 
49Eph 5:32 There is a deep secret truth revealed in this scripture, which I understand as applying to Christ and the church. 
49Eph 5:33 But it also applies to you£º every husband must love his wife as himself, and every wife must respect her husband. 
49Eph 6:1 Children, it is your Christian duty to obey your parents, for this is the right thing to do. 
49Eph 6:2 "Respect your father and mother" is the first commandment that has a promise added£º 
49Eph 6:3 "so that all may go well with you, and you may live a long time in the land." 
49Eph 6:4 Parents, do not treat your children in such a way as to make them angry. Instead, raise them with Christian discipline and instruction. 
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your human masters with fear and trembling; and do it with a sincere heart, as though you were serving Christ. 
49Eph 6:6 Do this not only when they are watching you, because you want to gain their approval; but with all your heart do what God wants, as slaves of Christ. 
49Eph 6:7 Do your work as slaves cheerfully, as though you served the Lord, and not merely human beings. 
49Eph 6:8 Remember that the Lord will reward each of us, whether slave or free, for the good work we do. 
49Eph 6:9 Masters, behave in the same way toward your slaves and stop using threats. Remember that you and your slaves belong to the same Master in heaven, who judges everyone by the same standard. 
49Eph 6:10 Finally, build up your strength in union with the Lord and by means of his mighty power. 
49Eph 6:11 Put on all the armor that God gives you, so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks. 
49Eph 6:12 For we are not fighting against human beings but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly world, the rulers, authorities, and cosmic powers of this dark age. 
49Eph 6:13 So put on God's armor now! Then when the evil day comes, you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks; and after fighting to the end, you will still hold your ground. 
49Eph 6:14 So stand ready, with truth as a belt tight around your waist, with righteousness as your breastplate, 
49Eph 6:15 and as your shoes the readiness to announce the Good News of peace. 
49Eph 6:16 At all times carry faith as a shield; for with it you will be able to put out all the burning arrows shot by the Evil One. 
49Eph 6:17 And accept salvation as a helmet, and the word of God as the sword which the Spirit gives you. 
49Eph 6:18 Do all this in prayer, asking for God's help. Pray on every occasion, as the Spirit leads. For this reason keep alert and never give up; pray always for all God's people. 
49Eph 6:19 And pray also for me, that God will give me a message when I am ready to speak, so that I may speak boldly and make known the gospel's secret. 
49Eph 6:20 For the sake of this gospel I am an ambassador, though now I am in prison. Pray that I may be bold in speaking about the gospel as I should. 
49Eph 6:21 Tychicus, our dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord's work, will give you all the news about me, so that you may know how I am getting along. 
49Eph 6:22 That is why I am sending him to you - to tell you how all of us are getting along and to encourage you. 
49Eph 6:23 May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give to all Christians peace and love with faith. 
49Eph 6:24 May God's grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying love.

50Php 1:1 From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus - To all God's people in Philippi who are in union with Christ Jesus, including the church leaders and helpers£º 
50Php 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
50Php 1:3 I thank my God for you every time I think of you; 
50Php 1:4 and every time I pray for you all, I pray with joy 
50Php 1:5 because of the way in which you have helped me in the work of the gospel from the very first day until now. 
50Php 1:6 And so I am sure that God, who began this good work in you, will carry it on until it is finished on the Day of Christ Jesus. 
50Php 1:7 You are always in my heart! And so it is only right for me to feel as I do about you. For you have all shared with me in this privilege that God has given me, both now that I am in prison and also while I was free to defend the gospel and establish it firmly. 
50Php 1:8 God is my witness that I tell the truth when I say that my deep feeling for you all comes from the heart of Christ Jesus himself. 
50Php 1:9 I pray that your love will keep on growing more and more, together with true knowledge and perfect judgment, 
50Php 1:10 so that you will be able to choose what is best. Then you will be free from all impurity and blame on the Day of Christ. 
50Php 1:11 Your lives will be filled with the truly good qualities which only Jesus Christ can produce, for the glory and praise of God. 
50Php 1:12 I want you to know, my friends, that the things that have happened to me have really helped the progress of the gospel. 
50Php 1:13 As a result, the whole palace guard and all the others here know that I am in prison because I am a servant of Christ. 
50Php 1:14 And my being in prison has given most of the believers more confidence in the Lord, so that they grow bolder all the time to preach the message fearlessly. 
50Php 1:15 Of course some of them preach Christ because they are jealous and quarrelsome, but others from genuine good will. 
50Php 1:16 These do so from love, because they know that God has given me the work of defending the gospel. 
50Php 1:17 The others do not proclaim Christ sincerely, but from a spirit of selfish ambition; they think that they will make more trouble for me while I am in prison. 
50Php 1:18 It does not matter! I am happy about it - just so Christ is preached in every way possible, whether from wrong or right motives. And I will continue to be happy, 
50Php 1:19 because I know that by means of your prayers and the help which comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ I shall be set free. 
50Php 1:20 My deep desire and hope is that I shall never fail in my duty, but that at all times, and especially right now, I shall be full of courage, so that with my whole being I shall bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die. 
50Php 1:21 For what is life? To me, it is Christ. Death, then, will bring more. 
50Php 1:22 But if by continuing to live I can do more worthwhile work, then I am not sure which I should choose. 
50Php 1:23 I am pulled in two directions. I want very much to leave this life and be with Christ, which is a far better thing; 
50Php 1:24 but for your sake it is much more important that I remain alive. 
50Php 1:25 I am sure of this, and so I know that I will stay. I will stay on with you all, to add to your progress and joy in the faith, 
50Php 1:26 so that when I am with you again, you will have even more reason to be proud of me in your life in union with Christ Jesus. 
50Php 1:27 Now, the important thing is that your way of life should be as the gospel of Christ requires, so that, whether or not I am able to go and see you, I will hear that you are standing firm with one common purpose and that with only one desire you are fighting together for the faith of the gospel. 
50Php 1:28 Don't be afraid of your enemies; always be courageous, and this will prove to them that they will lose and that you will win, because it is God who gives you the victory. 
50Php 1:29 For you have been given the privilege of serving Christ, not only by believing in him, but also by suffering for him. 
50Php 1:30 Now you can take part with me in the battle. It is the same battle you saw me fighting in the past, and as you hear, the one I am fighting still. 
50Php 2:1 Your life in Christ makes you strong, and his love comforts you. You have fellowship with the Spirit, and you have kindness and compassion for one another. 
50Php 2:2 I urge you, then, to make me completely happy by having the same thoughts, sharing the same love, and being one in soul and mind. 
50Php 2:3 Don't do anything from selfish ambition or from a cheap desire to boast, but be humble toward one another, always considering others better than yourselves. 
50Php 2:4 And look out for one another's interests, not just for your own. 
50Php 2:5 The attitude you should have is the one that Christ Jesus had£º 
50Php 2:6 He always had the nature of God, but he did not think that by force he should try to remain equal with God. 
50Php 2:7 Instead of this, of his own free will he gave up all he had, and took the nature of a servant. He became like a human being and appeared in human likeness. 
50Php 2:8 He was humble and walked the path of obedience all the way to death - his death on the cross. 
50Php 2:9 For this reason God raised him to the highest place above and gave him the name that is greater than any other name. 
50Php 2:10 And so, in honor of the name of Jesus all beings in heaven, on earth, and in the world below will fall on their knees, 
50Php 2:11 and all will openly proclaim that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
50Php 2:12 So then, dear friends, as you always obeyed me when I was with you, it is even more important that you obey me now while I am away from you. Keep on working with fear and trembling to complete your salvation, 
50Php 2:13 because God is always at work in you to make you willing and able to obey his own purpose. 
50Php 2:14 Do everything without complaining or arguing, 
50Php 2:15 so that you may be innocent and pure as God's perfect children, who live in a world of corrupt and sinful people. You must shine among them like stars lighting up the sky, 
50Php 2:16 as you offer them the message of life. If you do so, I shall have reason to be proud of you on the Day of Christ, because it will show that all my effort and work have not been wasted. 
50Php 2:17 Perhaps my life's blood is to be poured out like an offering on the sacrifice that your faith offers to God. If that is so, I am glad and share my joy with you all. 
50Php 2:18 In the same way, you too must be glad and share your joy with me. 
50Php 2:19 If it is the Lord's will, I hope that I will be able to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be encouraged by news about you. 
50Php 2:20 He is the only one who shares my feelings and who really cares about you. 
50Php 2:21 Everyone else is concerned only with their own affairs, not with the cause of Jesus Christ. 
50Php 2:22 And you yourselves know how he has proved his worth, how he and I, like a son and his father, have worked together for the sake of the gospel. 
50Php 2:23 So I hope to send him to you as soon as I know how things are going to turn out for me. 
50Php 2:24 And I trust in the Lord that I myself will be able to come to you soon. 
50Php 2:25 I have thought it necessary to send to you our brother Epaphroditus, who has worked and fought by my side and who has served as your messenger in helping me. 
50Php 2:26 He is anxious to see you all and is very upset because you had heard that he was sick. 
50Php 2:27 Indeed he was sick and almost died. But God had pity on him, and not only on him but on me, too, and spared me an even greater sorrow. 
50Php 2:28 I am all the more eager, then, to send him to you, so that you will be glad again when you see him, and my own sorrow will disappear. 
50Php 2:29 Receive him, then, with joy, as a believer in the Lord. Show respect to all such people as he, 
50Php 2:30 because he risked his life and nearly died for the sake of the work of Christ, in order to give me the help that you yourselves could not give. 
50Php 3:1 In conclusion, my friends, be joyful in your union with the Lord. I don't mind repeating what I have written before, and you will be safer if I do so. 
50Php 3:2 Watch out for those who do evil things, those dogs, those who insist on cutting the body. 
50Php 3:3 It is we, not they, who have received the true circumcision, for we worship God by means of his Spirit and rejoice in our life in union with Christ Jesus. We do not put any trust in external ceremonies. 
50Php 3:4 I could, of course, put my trust in such things. If any of you think you can trust in external ceremonies, I have even more reason to feel that way. 
50Php 3:5 I was circumcised when I was a week old. I am an Israelite by birth, of the tribe of Benjamin, a pure-blooded Hebrew. As far as keeping the Jewish Law is concerned, I was a Pharisee, 
50Php 3:6 and I was so zealous that I persecuted the church. As far as a person can be righteous by obeying the commands of the Law, I was without fault. 
50Php 3:7 But all those things that I might count as profit I now reckon as loss for Christ's sake. 
50Php 3:8 Not only those things; I reckon everything as complete loss for the sake of what is so much more valuable, the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have thrown everything away; I consider it all as mere garbage, so that I may gain Christ 
50Php 3:9 and be completely united with him. I no longer have a righteousness of my own, the kind that is gained by obeying the Law. I now have the righteousness that is given through faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and is based on faith. 
50Php 3:10 All I want is to know Christ and to experience the power of his resurrection, to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death, 
50Php 3:11 in the hope that I myself will be raised from death to life. 
50Php 3:12 I do not claim that I have already succeeded or have already become perfect. I keep striving to win the prize for which Christ Jesus has already won me to himself. 
50Php 3:13 Of course, my friends, I really do not think that I have already won it; the one thing I do, however, is to forget what is behind me and do my best to reach what is ahead. 
50Php 3:14 So I run straight toward the goal in order to win the prize, which is God's call through Christ Jesus to the life above. 
50Php 3:15 All of us who are spiritually mature should have this same attitude. But if some of you have a different attitude, God will make this clear to you. 
50Php 3:16 However that may be, let us go forward according to the same rules we have followed until now. 
50Php 3:17 Keep on imitating me, my friends. Pay attention to those who follow the right example that we have set for you. 
50Php 3:18 I have told you this many times before, and now I repeat it with tears£º there are many whose lives make them enemies of Christ's death on the cross. 
50Php 3:19 They are going to end up in hell, because their god is their bodily desires. They are proud of what they should be ashamed of, and they think only of things that belong to this world. 
50Php 3:20 We, however, are citizens of heaven, and we eagerly wait for our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to come from heaven. 
50Php 3:21 He will change our weak mortal bodies and make them like his own glorious body, using that power by which he is able to bring all things under his rule. 
50Php 4:1 So then, my friends, how dear you are to me and how I miss you! How happy you make me, and how proud I am of you! - this, dear friends, is how you should stand firm in your life in the Lord. 
50Php 4:2 Euodia and Syntyche, please, I beg you, try to agree as sisters in the Lord. 
50Php 4:3 And you too, my faithful partner, I want you to help these women; for they have worked hard with me to spread the gospel, together with Clement and all my other fellow workers, whose names are in God's book of the living. 
50Php 4:4 May you always be joyful in your union with the Lord. I say it again£º rejoice! 
50Php 4:5 Show a gentle attitude toward everyone. The Lord is coming soon. 
50Php 4:6 Don't worry about anything, but in all your prayers ask God for what you need, always asking him with a thankful heart. 
50Php 4:7 And God's peace, which is far beyond human understanding, will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus. 
50Php 4:8 In conclusion, my friends, fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise£º things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, and honorable. 
50Php 4:9 Put into practice what you learned and received from me, both from my words and from my actions. And the God who gives us peace will be with you. 
50Php 4:10 In my life in union with the Lord it is a great joy to me that after so long a time you once more had the chance of showing that you care for me. I don't mean that you had stopped caring for me - you just had no chance to show it. 
50Php 4:11 And I am not saying this because I feel neglected, for I have learned to be satisfied with what I have. 
50Php 4:12 I know what it is to be in need and what it is to have more than enough. I have learned this secret, so that anywhere, at any time, I am content, whether I am full or hungry, whether I have too much or too little. 
50Php 4:13 I have the strength to face all conditions by the power that Christ gives me. 
50Php 4:14 But it was very good of you to help me in my troubles. 
50Php 4:15 You Philippians know very well that when I left Macedonia in the early days of preaching the Good News, you were the only church to help me; you were the only ones who shared my profits and losses. 
50Php 4:16 More than once when I needed help in Thessalonica, you sent it to me. 
50Php 4:17 It is not that I just want to receive gifts; rather, I want to see profit added to your account. 
50Php 4:18 Here, then, is my receipt for everything you have given me - and it has been more than enough! I have all I need now that Epaphroditus has brought me all your gifts. They are like a sweet-smelling offering to God, a sacrifice which is acceptable and pleasing to him. 
50Php 4:19 And with all his abundant wealth through Christ Jesus, my God will supply all your needs. 
50Php 4:20 To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 
50Php 4:21 Greetings to each one of God's people who belong to Christ Jesus. The believers here with me send you their greetings. 
50Php 4:22 All God's people here send greetings, especially those who belong to the Emperor's palace. 
50Php 4:23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

51Col 1:1 From Paul, who by God's will is an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy - 
51Col 1:2 To God's people in Colossae, who are our faithful friends in union with Christ£º May God our Father give you grace and peace. 
51Col 1:3 We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you. 
51Col 1:4 For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all God's people. 
51Col 1:5 When the true message, the Good News, first came to you, you heard about the hope it offers. So your faith and love are based on what you hope for, which is kept safe for you in heaven. 
51Col 1:6 The gospel keeps bringing blessings and is spreading throughout the world, just as it has among you ever since the day you first heard about the grace of God and came to know it as it really is. 
51Col 1:7 You learned of God's grace from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is Christ's faithful worker on our behalf. 
51Col 1:8 He has told us of the love that the Spirit has given you. 
51Col 1:9 For this reason we have always prayed for you, ever since we heard about you. We ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will, with all the wisdom and understanding that his Spirit gives. 
51Col 1:10 Then you will be able to live as the Lord wants and will always do what pleases him. Your lives will produce all kinds of good deeds, and you will grow in your knowledge of God. 
51Col 1:11 May you be made strong with all the strength which comes from his glorious power, so that you may be able to endure everything with patience. 
51Col 1:12 And with joy give thanks to the Father, who has made you fit to have your share of what God has reserved for his people in the kingdom of light. 
51Col 1:13 He rescued us from the power of darkness and brought us safe into the kingdom of his dear Son, 
51Col 1:14 by whom we are set free, that is, our sins are forgiven. 
51Col 1:15 Christ is the visible likeness of the invisible God. He is the first-born Son, superior to all created things. 
51Col 1:16 For through him God created everything in heaven and on earth, the seen and the unseen things, including spiritual powers, lords, rulers, and authorities. God created the whole universe through him and for him. 
51Col 1:17 Christ existed before all things, and in union with him all things have their proper place. 
51Col 1:18 He is the head of his body, the church; he is the source of the body's life. He is the first-born Son, who was raised from death, in order that he alone might have the first place in all things. 
51Col 1:19 For it was by God's own decision that the Son has in himself the full nature of God. 
51Col 1:20 Through the Son, then, God decided to bring the whole universe back to himself. God made peace through his Son's blood on the cross and so brought back to himself all things, both on earth and in heaven. 
51Col 1:21 At one time you were far away from God and were his enemies because of the evil things you did and thought. 
51Col 1:22 But now, by means of the physical death of his Son, God has made you his friends, in order to bring you, holy, pure, and faultless, into his presence. 
51Col 1:23 You must, of course, continue faithful on a firm and sure foundation, and must not allow yourselves to be shaken from the hope you gained when you heard the gospel. It is of this gospel that I, Paul, became a servant - this gospel which has been preached to everybody in the world. 
51Col 1:24 And now I am happy about my sufferings for you, for by means of my physical sufferings I am helping to complete what still remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body, the church. 
51Col 1:25 And I have been made a servant of the church by God, who gave me this task to perform for your good. It is the task of fully proclaiming his message, 
51Col 1:26 which is the secret he hid through all past ages from all human beings but has now revealed to his people. 
51Col 1:27 God's plan is to make known his secret to his people, this rich and glorious secret which he has for all peoples. And the secret is that Christ is in you, which means that you will share in the glory of God. 
51Col 1:28 So we preach Christ to everyone. With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one into God's presence as a mature individual in union with Christ. 
51Col 1:29 To get this done I toil and struggle, using the mighty strength which Christ supplies and which is at work in me. 
51Col 2:1 Let me tell you how hard I have worked for you and for the people in Laodicea and for all others who do not know me personally. 
51Col 2:2 I do this in order that they may be filled with courage and may be drawn together in love, and so have the full wealth of assurance which true understanding brings. In this way they will know God's secret, which is Christ himself. 
51Col 2:3 He is the key that opens all the hidden treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge. 
51Col 2:4 I tell you, then, do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments, no matter how good they seem to be. 
51Col 2:5 For even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, and I am glad as I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ. 
51Col 2:6 Since you have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, live in union with him. 
51Col 2:7 Keep your roots deep in him, build your lives on him, and become stronger in your faith, as you were taught. And be filled with thanksgiving. 
51Col 2:8 See to it, then, that no one enslaves you by means of the worthless deceit of human wisdom, which comes from the teachings handed down by human beings and from the ruling spirits of the universe, and not from Christ. 
51Col 2:9 For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ, in his humanity, 
51Col 2:10 and you have been given full life in union with him. He is supreme over every spiritual ruler and authority. 
51Col 2:11 In union with Christ you were circumcised, not with the circumcision that is made by human beings, but with the circumcision made by Christ, which consists of being freed from the power of this sinful self. 
51Col 2:12 For when you were baptized, you were buried with Christ, and in baptism you were also raised with Christ through your faith in the active power of God, who raised him from death. 
51Col 2:13 You were at one time spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were Gentiles without the Law. But God has now brought you to life with Christ. God forgave us all our sins; 
51Col 2:14 he canceled the unfavorable record of our debts with its binding rules and did away with it completely by nailing it to the cross. 
51Col 2:15 And on that cross Christ freed himself from the power of the spiritual rulers and authorities; he made a public spectacle of them by leading them as captives in his victory procession. 
51Col 2:16 So let no one make rules about what you eat or drink or about holy days or the New Moon Festival or the Sabbath. 
51Col 2:17 All such things are only a shadow of things in the future; the reality is Christ. 
51Col 2:18 Do not allow yourselves to be condemned by anyone who claims to be superior because of special visions and who insists on false humility and the worship of angels. For no reason at all, such people are all puffed up by their human way of thinking 
51Col 2:19 and have stopped holding on to Christ, who is the head of the body. Under Christ's control the whole body is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God wants it to grow. 
51Col 2:20 You have died with Christ and are set free from the ruling spirits of the universe. Why, then, do you live as though you belonged to this world? Why do you obey such rules as 
51Col 2:21 "Don't handle this," "Don't taste that," "Don't touch the other"? 
51Col 2:22 All these refer to things which become useless once they are used; they are only human rules and teachings. 
51Col 2:23 Of course such rules appear to be based on wisdom in their forced worship of angels, and false humility, and severe treatment of the body; but they have no real value in controlling physical passions. 
51Col 3:1 You have been raised to life with Christ, so set your hearts on the things that are in heaven, where Christ sits on his throne at the right side of God. 
51Col 3:2 Keep your minds fixed on things there, not on things here on earth. 
51Col 3:3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
51Col 3:4 Your real life is Christ and when he appears, then you too will appear with him and share his glory! 
51Col 3:5 You must put to death, then, the earthly desires at work in you, such as sexual immorality, indecency, lust, evil passions, and greed (for greed is a form of idolatry). 
51Col 3:6 Because of such things God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him. 
51Col 3:7 At one time you yourselves used to live according to such desires, when your life was dominated by them. 
51Col 3:8 But now you must get rid of all these things£º anger, passion, and hateful feelings. No insults or obscene talk must ever come from your lips. 
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to one another, for you have put off the old self with its habits 
51Col 3:10 and have put on the new self. This is the new being which God, its Creator, is constantly renewing in his own image, in order to bring you to a full knowledge of himself. 
51Col 3:11 As a result, there is no longer any distinction between Gentiles and Jews, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarians, savages, slaves, and free, but Christ is all, Christ is in all. 
51Col 3:12 You are the people of God; he loved you and chose you for his own. So then, you must clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 
51Col 3:13 Be tolerant with one another and forgive one another whenever any of you has a complaint against someone else. You must forgive one another just as the Lord has forgiven you. 
51Col 3:14 And to all these qualities add love, which binds all things together in perfect unity. 
51Col 3:15 The peace that Christ gives is to guide you in the decisions you make; for it is to this peace that God has called you together in the one body. And be thankful. 
51Col 3:16 Christ's message in all its richness must live in your hearts. Teach and instruct one another with all wisdom. Sing psalms, hymns, and sacred songs; sing to God with thanksgiving in your hearts. 
51Col 3:17 Everything you do or say, then, should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks through him to God the Father. 
51Col 3:18 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, for that is what you should do as Christians. 
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. 
51Col 3:20 Children, it is your Christian duty to obey your parents always, for that is what pleases God. 
51Col 3:21 Parents, do not irritate your children, or they will become discouraged. 
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your human masters in all things, not only when they are watching you because you want to gain their approval; but do it with a sincere heart because of your reverence for the Lord. 
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people. 
51Col 3:24 Remember that the Lord will give you as a reward what he has kept for his people. For Christ is the real Master you serve. 
51Col 3:25 And all wrongdoers will be repaid for the wrong things they do, because God judges everyone by the same standard. 
51Col 4:1 Masters, be fair and just in the way you treat your slaves. Remember that you too have a Master in heaven. 
51Col 4:2 Be persistent in prayer, and keep alert as you pray, giving thanks to God. 
51Col 4:3 At the same time pray also for us, so that God will give us a good opportunity to preach his message about the secret of Christ. For that is why I am now in prison. 
51Col 4:4 Pray, then, that I may speak, as I should, in such a way as to make it clear. 
51Col 4:5 Be wise in the way you act toward those who are not believers, making good use of every opportunity you have. 
51Col 4:6 Your speech should always be pleasant and interesting, and you should know how to give the right answer to everyone. 
51Col 4:7 Our dear friend Tychicus, who is a faithful worker and fellow servant in the Lord's work, will give you all the news about me. 
51Col 4:8 That is why I am sending him to you, in order to cheer you up by telling you how all of us are getting along. 
51Col 4:9 With him goes Onesimus, that dear and faithful friend, who belongs to your group. They will tell you everything that is happening here. 
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have already received instructions to welcome Mark if he comes your way.) 
51Col 4:11 Joshua, also called Justus, sends greetings too. These three are the only Jewish believers who work with me for the Kingdom of God, and they have been a great help to me. 
51Col 4:12 Greetings from Epaphras, another member of your group and a servant of Christ Jesus. He always prays fervently for you, asking God to make you stand firm, as mature and fully convinced Christians, in complete obedience to God's will. 
51Col 4:13 I can personally testify to his hard work for you and for the people in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
51Col 4:14 Luke, our dear doctor, and Demas send you their greetings. 
51Col 4:15 Give our best wishes to the believers in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house. 
51Col 4:16 After you read this letter, make sure that it is read also in the church at Laodicea. At the same time, you are to read the letter that the believers in Laodicea will send you. 
51Col 4:17 And tell Archippus, "Be sure to finish the task you were given in the Lord's service." 
51Col 4:18 With my own hand I write this£º {\I Greetings from Paul.Do not forget my chains! May God's grace be with you.
52
521Th 1:1 From Paul, Silas, and Timothy - To the people of the church in Thessalonica, who belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ£º May grace and peace be yours. 
521Th 1:2 We always thank God for you all and always mention you in our prayers. 
521Th 1:3 For we remember before our God and Father how you put your faith into practice, how your love made you work so hard, and how your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is firm. 
521Th 1:4 Our friends, we know that God loves you and has chosen you to be his own. 
521Th 1:5 For we brought the Good News to you, not with words only, but also with power and the Holy Spirit, and with complete conviction of its truth. You know how we lived when we were with you; it was for your own good. 
521Th 1:6 You imitated us and the Lord; and even though you suffered much, you received the message with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit. 
521Th 1:7 So you became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia. 
521Th 1:8 For not only did the message about the Lord go out from you throughout Macedonia and Achaia, but the news about your faith in God has gone everywhere. There is nothing, then, that we need to say. 
521Th 1:9 All those people speak about how you received us when we visited you, and how you turned away from idols to God, to serve the true and living God 
521Th 1:10 and to wait for his Son to come from heaven - his Son Jesus, whom he raised from death and who rescues us from God's anger that is coming. 
521Th 2:1 Our friends, you yourselves know that our visit to you was not a failure. 
521Th 2:2 You know how we had already been mistreated and insulted in Philippi before we came to you in Thessalonica. And even though there was much opposition, our God gave us courage to tell you the Good News that comes from him. 
521Th 2:3 Our appeal to you is not based on error or impure motives, nor do we try to trick anyone. 
521Th 2:4 Instead, we always speak as God wants us to, because he has judged us worthy to be entrusted with the Good News. We do not try to please people, but to please God, who tests our motives. 
521Th 2:5 You know very well that we did not come to you with flattering talk, nor did we use words to cover up greed - God is our witness! 
521Th 2:6 We did not try to get praise from anyone, either from you or from others, 
521Th 2:7 even though as apostles of Christ we could have made demands on you. But we were gentle when we were with you, like a mother taking care of her children. 
521Th 2:8 Because of our love for you we were ready to share with you not only the Good News from God but even our own lives. You were so dear to us! 
521Th 2:9 Surely you remember, our friends, how we worked and toiled! We worked day and night so that we would not be any trouble to you as we preached to you the Good News from God. 
521Th 2:10 You are our witnesses, and so is God, that our conduct toward you who believe was pure, right, and without fault. 
521Th 2:11 You know that we treated each one of you just as parents treat their own children. 
521Th 2:12 We encouraged you, we comforted you, and we kept urging you to live the kind of life that pleases God, who calls you to share in his own Kingdom and glory. 
521Th 2:13 And there is another reason why we always give thanks to God. When we brought you God's message, you heard it and accepted it, not as a message from human beings but as God's message, which indeed it is. For God is at work in you who believe. 
521Th 2:14 Our friends, the same things happened to you that happened to the churches of God in Judea, to the people there who belong to Christ Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from your own people that they suffered from the Jews, 
521Th 2:15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us. How displeasing they are to God! How hostile they are to everyone! 
521Th 2:16 They even tried to stop us from preaching to the Gentiles the message that would bring them salvation. In this way they have brought to completion all the sins they have always committed. And now God's anger has at last come down on them! 
521Th 2:17 As for us, friends, when we were separated from you for a little while - not in our thoughts, of course, but only in body - how we missed you and how hard we tried to see you again! 
521Th 2:18 We wanted to return to you. I myself tried to go back more than once, but Satan would not let us. 
521Th 2:19 After all, it is you - you, no less than others! - who are our hope, our joy, and our reason for boasting of our victory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes. 
521Th 2:20 Indeed, you are our pride and our joy! 
521Th 3:1 Finally, we could not bear it any longer. So we decided to stay on alone in Athens 
521Th 3:2 while we sent Timothy, our brother who works with us for God in preaching the Good News about Christ. We sent him to strengthen you and help your faith, 
521Th 3:3 so that none of you should turn back because of these persecutions. You yourselves know that such persecutions are part of God's will for us. 
521Th 3:4 For while we were still with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to be persecuted; and as you well know, that is exactly what happened. 
521Th 3:5 That is why I had to send Timothy. I could not bear it any longer, so I sent him to find out about your faith. Surely it could not be that the Devil had tempted you and all our work had been for nothing! 
521Th 3:6 Now Timothy has come back, and he has brought us the welcome news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always think well of us and that you want to see us just as much as we want to see you. 
521Th 3:7 So, in all our trouble and suffering we have been encouraged about you, friends. It was your faith that encouraged us, 
521Th 3:8 because now we really live if you stand firm in your life in union with the Lord. 
521Th 3:9 Now we can give thanks to our God for you. We thank him for the joy we have in his presence because of you. 
521Th 3:10 Day and night we ask him with all our heart to let us see you personally and supply what is needed in your faith. 
521Th 3:11 May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus prepare the way for us to come to you! 
521Th 3:12 May the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow more and more and become as great as our love for you. 
521Th 3:13 In this way he will strengthen you, and you will be perfect and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all who belong to him. 
521Th 4:1 Finally, our friends, you learned from us how you should live in order to please God. This is, of course, the way you have been living. And now we beg and urge you in the name of the Lord Jesus to do even more. 
521Th 4:2 For you know the instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus. 
521Th 4:3 God wants you to be holy and completely free from sexual immorality. 
521Th 4:4 Each of you should know how to live with your wife in a holy and honorable way, 
521Th 4:5 not with a lustful desire, like the heathen who do not know God. 
521Th 4:6 In this matter, then, none of you should do wrong to other Christians or take advantage of them. We have told you this before, and we strongly warned you that the Lord will punish those who do that. 
521Th 4:7 God did not call us to live in immorality, but in holiness. 
521Th 4:8 So then, whoever rejects this teaching is not rejecting a human being, but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit. 
521Th 4:9 There is no need to write you about love for each other. You yourselves have been taught by God how you should love one another. 
521Th 4:10 And you have, in fact, behaved like this toward all the believers in all of Macedonia. So we beg you, our friends, to do even more. 
521Th 4:11 Make it your aim to live a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to earn your own living, just as we told you before. 
521Th 4:12 In this way you will win the respect of those who are not believers, and you will not have to depend on anyone for what you need. 
521Th 4:13 Our friends, we want you to know the truth about those who have died, so that you will not be sad, as are those who have no hope. 
521Th 4:14 We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will take back with Jesus those who have died believing in him. 
521Th 4:15 W_ hat we are teaching you now is the Lord's teaching£º we who are alive on the day the Lord comes will not go ahead of those who have died. 
521Th 4:16 There will be the shout of command, the archangel's voice, the sound of God's trumpet, and the Lord himself will come down from heaven. Those who have died believing in Christ will rise to life first; 
521Th 4:17 then we who are living at that time will be gathered up along with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord. 
521Th 4:18 So then, encourage one another with these words. 
521Th 5:1 There is no need to write you, friends, about the times and occasions when these things will happen. 
521Th 5:2 For you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come as a thief comes at night. 
521Th 5:3 When people say, "Everything is quiet and safe," then suddenly destruction will hit them! It will come as suddenly as the pains that come upon a woman in labor, and people will not escape. 
521Th 5:4 But you, friends, are not in the darkness, and the Day should not take you by surprise like a thief. 
521Th 5:5 All of you are people who belong to the light, who belong to the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 
521Th 5:6 So then, we should not be sleeping like the others; we should be awake and sober. 
521Th 5:7 It is at night when people sleep; it is at night when they get drunk. 
521Th 5:8 But we belong to the day, and we should be sober. We must wear faith and love as a breastplate, and our hope of salvation as a helmet. 
521Th 5:9 God did not choose us to suffer his anger, but to possess salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
521Th 5:10 who died for us in order that we might live together with him, whether we are alive or dead when he comes. 
521Th 5:11 And so encourage one another and help one another, just as you are now doing. 
521Th 5:12 We beg you, our friends, to pay proper respect to those who work among you, who guide and instruct you in the Christian life. 
521Th 5:13 Treat them with the greatest respect and love because of the work they do. Be at peace among yourselves. 
521Th 5:14 We urge you, our friends, to warn the idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
521Th 5:15 See that no one pays back wrong for wrong, but at all times make it your aim to do good to one another and to all people. 
521Th 5:16 Be joyful always, 
521Th 5:17 pray at all times, 
521Th 5:18 be thankful in all circumstances. This is what God wants from you in your life in union with Christ Jesus. 
521Th 5:19 Do not restrain the Holy Spirit; 
521Th 5:20 do not despise inspired messages. 
521Th 5:21 Put all things to the test£º keep what is good 
521Th 5:22 and avoid every kind of evil. 
521Th 5:23 May the God who gives us peace make you holy in every way and keep your whole being - spirit, soul, and body - free from every fault at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
521Th 5:24 He who calls you will do it, because he is faithful. 
521Th 5:25 Pray also for us, friends. 
521Th 5:26 Greet all the believers with the kiss of peace. 
521Th 5:27 I urge you by the authority of the Lord to read this letter to all the believers. 
521Th 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

532Th 1:1 From Paul, Silas, and Timothy - To the people of the church in Thessalonica, who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ£º 
532Th 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
532Th 1:3 Our friends, we must thank God at all times for you. It is right for us to do so, because your faith is growing so much and the love each of you has for the others is becoming greater. 
532Th 1:4 That is why we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God. We boast about the way you continue to endure and believe through all the persecutions and sufferings you are experiencing. 
532Th 1:5 All of this proves that God's judgment is just and as a result you will become worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering. 
532Th 1:6 God will do what is right£º he will bring suffering on those who make you suffer, 
532Th 1:7 and he will give relief to you who suffer and to us as well. He will do this when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven with his mighty angels, 
532Th 1:8 with a flaming fire, to punish those who reject God and who do not obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus. 
532Th 1:9 They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from his glorious might, 
532Th 1:10 when he comes on that Day to receive glory from all his people and honor from all who believe. You too will be among them, because you have believed the message that we told you. 
532Th 1:11 That is why we always pray for you. We ask our God to make you worthy of the life he has called you to live. May he fulfill by his power all your desire for goodness and complete your work of faith. 
532Th 1:12 In this way the name of our Lord Jesus will receive glory from you, and you from him, by the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
532Th 2:1 Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to be with him£º I beg you, my friends, 
532Th 2:2 not to be so easily confused in your thinking or upset by the claim that the Day of the Lord has come. Perhaps it is thought that we said this while prophesying or preaching, or that we wrote it in a letter. 
532Th 2:3 Do not let anyone deceive you in any way. For the Day will not come until the final Rebellion takes place and the Wicked One appears, who is destined to hell. 
532Th 2:4 He will oppose every so-called god or object of worship and will put himself above them all. He will even go in and sit down in God's Temple and claim to be God. 
532Th 2:5 Don't you remember? I told you all this while I was with you. 
532Th 2:6 Yet there is something that keeps this from happening now, and you know what it is. At the proper time, then, the Wicked One will appear. 
532Th 2:7 The Mysterious Wickedness is already at work, but what is going to happen will not happen until the one who holds it back is taken out of the way. 
532Th 2:8 Then the Wicked One will be revealed, but when the Lord Jesus comes, he will kill him with the breath from his mouth and destroy him with his dazzling presence. 
532Th 2:9 The Wicked One will come with the power of Satan and perform all kinds of false miracles and wonders, 
532Th 2:10 and use every kind of wicked deceit on those who will perish. They will perish because they did not welcome and love the truth so as to be saved. 
532Th 2:11 And so God sends the power of error to work in them so that they believe what is false. 
532Th 2:12 The result is that all who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in sin, will be condemned. 
532Th 2:13 We must thank God at all times for you, friends, you whom the Lord loves. For God chose you as the first to be saved by the Spirit's power to make you his holy people and by your faith in the truth. 
532Th 2:14 God called you to this through the Good News we preached to you; he called you to possess your share of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
532Th 2:15 So then, our friends, stand firm and hold on to those truths which we taught you, both in our preaching and in our letter. 
532Th 2:16 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and in his grace gave us unfailing courage and a firm hope, 
532Th 2:17 encourage you and strengthen you to always do and say what is good. 
532Th 3:1 Finally, our friends, pray for us that the Lord's message may continue to spread rapidly and be received with honor, just as it was among you. 
532Th 3:2 Pray also that God will rescue us from wicked and evil people; for not everyone believes the message. 
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and keep you safe from the Evil One. 
532Th 3:4 And the Lord gives us confidence in you, and we are sure that you are doing and will continue to do what we tell you. 
532Th 3:5 May the Lord lead you into a greater understanding of God's love and the endurance that is given by Christ. 
532Th 3:6 Our friends, we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to keep away from all believers who are living a lazy life and who do not follow the instructions that we gave them. 
532Th 3:7 You yourselves know very well that you should do just what we did. We were not lazy when we were with you. 
532Th 3:8 We did not accept anyone's support without paying for it. Instead, we worked and toiled; we kept working day and night so as not to be an expense to any of you. 
532Th 3:9 We did this, not because we do not have the right to demand our support; we did it to be an example for you to follow. 
532Th 3:10 While we were with you, we used to tell you, "Whoever refuses to work is not allowed to eat." 
532Th 3:11 We say this because we hear that there are some people among you who live lazy lives and who do nothing except meddle in other people's business. 
532Th 3:12 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we command these people and warn them to lead orderly lives and work to earn their own living. 
532Th 3:13 But you, friends, must not become tired of doing good. 
532Th 3:14 It may be that some there will not obey the message we send you in this letter. If so, take note of them and have nothing to do with them, so that they will be ashamed. 
532Th 3:15 But do not treat them as enemies; instead, warn them as believers. 
532Th 3:16 May the Lord himself, who is our source of peace, give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
532Th 3:17 With my own hand I write this£º {\I Greetings from Paul.This is the way I sign every letter; this is how I write.
532Th 3:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

541Tm 1:1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by order of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope - 
541Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my true son in the faith£º May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace. 
541Tm 1:3 I want you to stay in Ephesus, just as I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia. Some people there are teaching false doctrines, and you must order them to stop. 
541Tm 1:4 Tell them to give up those legends and those long lists of ancestors, which only produce arguments; they do not serve God's plan, which is known by faith. 
541Tm 1:5 The purpose of this order is to arouse the love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a genuine faith. 
541Tm 1:6 Some people have turned away from these and have lost their way in foolish discussions. 
541Tm 1:7 They want to be teachers of God's law, but they do not understand their own words or the matters about which they speak with so much confidence. 
541Tm 1:8 We know that the Law is good if it is used as it should be used. 
541Tm 1:9 It must be remembered, of course, that laws are made, not for good people, but for lawbreakers and criminals, for the godless and sinful, for those who are not religious or spiritual, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 
541Tm 1:10 for the immoral, for sexual perverts, for kidnappers, for those who lie and give false testimony or who do anything else contrary to sound doctrine. 
541Tm 1:11 That teaching is found in the gospel that was entrusted to me to announce, the Good News from the glorious and blessed God. 
541Tm 1:12 I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength for my work. I thank him for considering me worthy and appointing me to serve him, 
541Tm 1:13 even though in the past I spoke evil of him and persecuted and insulted him. But God was merciful to me because I did not yet have faith and so did not know what I was doing. 
541Tm 1:14 And our Lord poured out his abundant grace on me and gave me the faith and love which are ours in union with Christ Jesus. 
541Tm 1:15 This is a true saying, to be completely accepted and believed£º Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. I am the worst of them, 
541Tm 1:16 but God was merciful to me in order that Christ Jesus might show his full patience in dealing with me, the worst of sinners, as an example for all those who would later believe in him and receive eternal life. 
541Tm 1:17 To the eternal King, immortal and invisible, the only God - to him be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen. 
541Tm 1:18 Timothy, my child, I entrust to you this command, which is in accordance with the words of prophecy spoken in the past about you. Use those words as weapons in order to fight well, 
541Tm 1:19 and keep your faith and a clear conscience. Some people have not listened to their conscience and have made a ruin of their faith. 
541Tm 1:20 Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have punished by handing them over to the power of Satan; this will teach them to stop their blasphemy. 
541Tm 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, requests, and thanksgivings be offered to God for all people; 
541Tm 2:2 for kings and all others who are in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceful life with all reverence toward God and with proper conduct. 
541Tm 2:3 This is good and it pleases God our Savior, 
541Tm 2:4 who wants everyone to be saved and to come to know the truth. 
541Tm 2:5 For there is one God, and there is one who brings God and human beings together, the man Christ Jesus, 
541Tm 2:6 who gave himself to redeem the whole human race. That was the proof at the right time that God wants everyone to be saved, 
541Tm 2:7 and that is why I was sent as an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles, to proclaim the message of faith and truth. I am not lying; I am telling the truth! 
541Tm 2:8 In every church service I want the men to pray, men who are dedicated to God and can lift up their hands in prayer without anger or argument. 
541Tm 2:9 I also want the women to be modest and sensible about their clothes and to dress properly; not with fancy hair styles or with gold ornaments or pearls or expensive dresses, 
541Tm 2:10 but with good deeds, as is proper for women who claim to be religious. 
541Tm 2:11 Women should learn in silence and all humility. 
541Tm 2:12 I do not allow them to teach or to have authority over men; they must keep quiet. 
541Tm 2:13 For Adam was created first, and then Eve. 
541Tm 2:14 And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and broke God's law. 
541Tm 2:15 But a woman will be saved through having children, if she perseveres in faith and love and holiness, with modesty. 
541Tm 3:1 This is a true saying£º If a man is eager to be a church leader, he desires an excellent work. 
541Tm 3:2 A church leader must be without fault; he must have only one wife, be sober, self-controlled, and orderly; he must welcome strangers in his home; he must be able to teach; 
541Tm 3:3 he must not be a drunkard or a violent man, but gentle and peaceful; he must not love money; 
541Tm 3:4 he must be able to manage his own family well and make his children obey him with all respect. 
541Tm 3:5 For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of the church of God? 
541Tm 3:6 He must be mature in the faith, so that he will not swell up with pride and be condemned, as the Devil was. 
541Tm 3:7 He should be a man who is respected by the people outside the church, so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the Devil's trap. 
541Tm 3:8 Church helpers must also have a good character and be sincere; they must not drink too much wine or be greedy for money; 
541Tm 3:9 they should hold to the revealed truth of the faith with a clear conscience. 
541Tm 3:10 They should be tested first, and then, if they pass the test, they are to serve. 
541Tm 3:11 Their wives also must be of good character and must not gossip; they must be sober and honest in everything. 
541Tm 3:12 A church helper must have only one wife, and be able to manage his children and family well. 
541Tm 3:13 Those helpers who do their work well win for themselves a good standing and are able to speak boldly about their faith in Christ Jesus. 
541Tm 3:14 As I write this letter to you, I hope to come and see you soon. 
541Tm 3:15 But if I delay, this letter will let you know how we should conduct ourselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth. 
541Tm 3:16 No one can deny how great is the secret of our religion£º He appeared in human form, was shown to be right by the Spirit, and was seen by angels. He was preached among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, and was taken up to heaven. 
541Tm 4:1 The Spirit says clearly that some people will abandon the faith in later times; they will obey lying spirits and follow the teachings of demons. 
541Tm 4:2 Such teachings are spread by deceitful liars, whose consciences are dead, as if burnt with a hot iron. 
541Tm 4:3 Such people teach that it is wrong to marry and to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten, after a prayer of thanks, by those who are believers and have come to know the truth. 
541Tm 4:4 Everything that God has created is good; nothing is to be rejected, but everything is to be received with a prayer of thanks, 
541Tm 4:5 because the word of God and the prayer make it acceptable to God. 
541Tm 4:6 If you give these instructions to the believers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, as you feed yourself spiritually on the words of faith and of the true teaching which you have followed. 
541Tm 4:7 But keep away from those godless legends, which are not worth telling. Keep yourself in training for a godly life. 
541Tm 4:8 Physical exercise has some value, but spiritual exercise is valuable in every way, because it promises life both for the present and for the future. 
541Tm 4:9 This is a true saying, to be completely accepted and believed. 
541Tm 4:10 We struggle and work hard, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all and especially of those who believe. 
541Tm 4:11 Give them these instructions and these teachings. 
541Tm 4:12 Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for the believers in your speech, your conduct, your love, faith, and purity. 
541Tm 4:13 Until I come, give your time and effort to the public reading of the Scriptures and to preaching and teaching. 
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you when the prophets spoke and the elders laid their hands on you. 
541Tm 4:15 Practice these things and devote yourself to them, in order that your progress may be seen by all. 
541Tm 4:16 Watch yourself and watch your teaching. Keep on doing these things, because if you do, you will save both yourself and those who hear you. 
541Tm 5:1 Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat the younger men as your brothers, 
541Tm 5:2 the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, with all purity. 
541Tm 5:3 Show respect for widows who really are all alone. 
541Tm 5:4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn first to carry out their religious duties toward their own family and in this way repay their parents and grandparents, because that is what pleases God. 
541Tm 5:5 A widow who is all alone, with no one to take care of her, has placed her hope in God and continues to pray and ask him for his help night and day. 
541Tm 5:6 But a widow who gives herself to pleasure has already died, even though she lives. 
541Tm 5:7 Give them these instructions, so that no one will find fault with them. 
541Tm 5:8 But if any do not take care of their relatives, especially the members of their own family, they have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever. 
541Tm 5:9 Do not add any widow to the list of widows unless she is over sixty years of age. In addition, she must have been married only once 
541Tm 5:10 and have a reputation for good deeds£º a woman who brought up her children well, received strangers in her home, performed humble duties for other Christians, helped people in trouble, and devoted herself to doing good. 
541Tm 5:11 But do not include younger widows in the list; because when their desires make them want to marry, they turn away from Christ, 
541Tm 5:12 and so become guilty of breaking their earlier promise to him. 
541Tm 5:13 They also learn to waste their time in going around from house to house; but even worse, they learn to be gossips and busybodies, talking of things they should not. 
541Tm 5:14 So I would prefer that the younger widows get married, have children, and take care of their homes, so as to give our enemies no chance of speaking evil of us. 
541Tm 5:15 For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan. 
541Tm 5:16 But if any Christian woman has widows in her family, she must take care of them and not put the burden on the church, so that it may take care of the widows who are all alone. 
541Tm 5:17 The elders who do good work as leaders should be considered worthy of receiving double pay, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. 
541Tm 5:18 For the scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain" and "Workers should be given their pay." 
541Tm 5:19 Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or more witnesses. 
541Tm 5:20 Rebuke publicly all those who commit sins, so that the rest may be afraid. 
541Tm 5:21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the holy angels I solemnly call upon you to obey these instructions without showing any prejudice or favor to anyone in anything you do. 
541Tm 5:22 Be in no hurry to lay hands on people to dedicate them to the Lord's service. Take no part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure. 
541Tm 5:23 Do not drink water only, but take a little wine to help your digestion, since you are sick so often. 
541Tm 5:24 The sins of some people are plain to see, and their sins go ahead of them to judgment; but the sins of others are seen only later. 
541Tm 5:25 In the same way good deeds are plainly seen, and even those that are not so plain cannot be hidden. 
541Tm 6:1 Those who are slaves must consider their masters worthy of all respect, so that no one will speak evil of the name of God and of our teaching. 
541Tm 6:2 Slaves belonging to Christian masters must not despise them, for they are believers too. Instead, they are to serve them even better, because those who benefit from their work are believers whom they love. You must teach and preach these things. 
541Tm 6:3 Whoever teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the teaching of our religion 
541Tm 6:4 is swollen with pride and knows nothing. He has an unhealthy desire to argue and quarrel about words, and this brings on jealousy, disputes, insults, evil suspicions, 
541Tm 6:5 and constant arguments from people whose minds do not function and who no longer have the truth. They think that religion is a way to become rich. 
541Tm 6:6 Well, religion does make us very rich, if we are satisfied with what we have. 
541Tm 6:7 What did we bring into the world? Nothing! What can we take out of the world? Nothing! 
541Tm 6:8 So then, if we have food and clothes, that should be enough for us. 
541Tm 6:9 But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and are caught in the trap of many foolish and harmful desires, which pull them down to ruin and destruction. 
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a source of all kinds of evil. Some have been so eager to have it that they have wandered away from the faith and have broken their hearts with many sorrows. 
541Tm 6:11 But you, man of God, avoid all these things. Strive for righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness. 
541Tm 6:12 Run your best in the race of faith, and win eternal life for yourself; for it was to this life that God called you when you firmly professed your faith before many witnesses. 
541Tm 6:13 Before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who firmly professed his faith before Pontius Pilate, I command you 
541Tm 6:14 to obey your orders and keep them faithfully until the Day when our Lord Jesus Christ will appear. 
541Tm 6:15 His appearing will be brought about at the right time by God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and the Lord of lords. 
541Tm 6:16 He alone is immortal; he lives in the light that no one can approach. No one has ever seen him; no one can ever see him. To him be honor and eternal power! Amen. 
541Tm 6:17 Command those who are rich in the things of this life not to be proud, but to place their hope, not in such an uncertain thing as riches, but in God, who generously gives us everything for our enjoyment. 
541Tm 6:18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share with others. 
541Tm 6:19 In this way they will store up for themselves a treasure which will be a solid foundation for the future. And then they will be able to win the life which is true life. 
541Tm 6:20 Timothy, keep safe what has been entrusted to your care. Avoid the profane talk and foolish arguments of what some people wrongly call "Knowledge." 
541Tm 6:21 For some have claimed to possess it, and as a result they have lost the way of faith. God's grace be with you all.

552Tm 1:1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, sent to proclaim the promised life which we have in union with Christ Jesus - 
552Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my dear son£º May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace. 
552Tm 1:3 I give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did. I thank him as I remember you always in my prayers night and day. 
552Tm 1:4 I remember your tears, and I want to see you very much, so that I may be filled with joy. 
552Tm 1:5 I remember the sincere faith you have, the kind of faith that your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice also had. I am sure that you have it also. 
552Tm 1:6 For this reason I remind you to keep alive the gift that God gave you when I laid my hands on you. 
552Tm 1:7 For the Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid; instead, his Spirit fills us with power, love, and self-control. 
552Tm 1:8 Do not be ashamed, then, of witnessing for our Lord; neither be ashamed of me, a prisoner for Christ's sake. Instead, take your part in suffering for the Good News, as God gives you the strength for it. 
552Tm 1:9 He saved us and called us to be his own people, not because of what we have done, but because of his own purpose and grace. He gave us this grace by means of Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 
552Tm 1:10 but now it has been revealed to us through the coming of our Savior, Christ Jesus. He has ended the power of death and through the gospel has revealed immortal life. 
552Tm 1:11 God has appointed me as an apostle and teacher to proclaim the Good News, 
552Tm 1:12 and it is for this reason that I suffer these things. But I am still full of confidence, because I know whom I have trusted, and I am sure that he is able to keep safe until that Day what he has entrusted to me. 
552Tm 1:13 Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you, as the example for you to follow, and remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus. 
552Tm 1:14 Through the power of the Holy Spirit, who lives in us, keep the good things that have been entrusted to you. 
552Tm 1:15 You know that everyone in the province of Asia, including Phygelus and Hermogenes, has deserted me. 
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he cheered me up many times. He was not ashamed that I am in prison, 
552Tm 1:17 but as soon as he arrived in Rome, he started looking for me until he found me. 
552Tm 1:18 May the Lord grant him his mercy on that Day! And you know very well how much he did for me in Ephesus. 
552Tm 2:1 As for you, my son, be strong through the grace that is ours in union with Christ Jesus. 
552Tm 2:2 Take the teachings that you heard me proclaim in the presence of many witnesses, and entrust them to reliable people, who will be able to teach others also. 
552Tm 2:3 Take your part in suffering, as a loyal soldier of Christ Jesus. 
552Tm 2:4 A soldier on active duty wants to please his commanding officer and so does not get mixed up in the affairs of civilian life. 
552Tm 2:5 An athlete who runs in a race cannot win the prize unless he obeys the rules. 
552Tm 2:6 The farmer who has done the hard work should have the first share of the harvest. 
552Tm 2:7 Think about what I am saying, because the Lord will enable you to understand it all. 
552Tm 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, who was raised from death, who was a descendant of David, as is taught in the Good News I preach. 
552Tm 2:9 Because I preach the Good News, I suffer and I am even chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not in chains, 
552Tm 2:10 and so I endure everything for the sake of God's chosen people, in order that they too may obtain the salvation that comes through Christ Jesus and brings eternal glory. 
552Tm 2:11 This is a true saying£º "If we have died with him, we shall also live with him. 
552Tm 2:12 If we continue to endure, we shall also rule with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. 
552Tm 2:13 If we are not faithful, he remains faithful, because he cannot be false to himself." 
552Tm 2:14 Remind your people of this, and give them a solemn warning in God's presence not to fight over words. It does no good, but only ruins the people who listen. 
552Tm 2:15 Do your best to win full approval in God's sight, as a worker who is not ashamed of his work, one who correctly teaches the message of God's truth. 
552Tm 2:16 Keep away from profane and foolish discussions, which only drive people farther away from God. 
552Tm 2:17 Such teaching is like an open sore that eats away the flesh. Two men who have taught such things are Hymenaeus and Philetus. 
552Tm 2:18 They have left the way of truth and are upsetting the faith of some believers by saying that our resurrection has already taken place. 
552Tm 2:19 But the solid foundation that God has laid cannot be shaken; and on it are written these words£º "The Lord knows those who are his" and "Those who say that they belong to the Lord must turn away from wrongdoing." 
552Tm 2:20 In a large house there are dishes and bowls of all kinds£º some are made of silver and gold, others of wood and clay; some are for special occasions, others for ordinary use. 
552Tm 2:21 Those who make themselves clean from all those evil things, will be used for special purposes, because they are dedicated and useful to their Master, ready to be used for every good deed. 
552Tm 2:22 Avoid the passions of youth, and strive for righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who with a pure heart call out to the Lord for help. 
552Tm 2:23 But keep away from foolish and ignorant arguments; you know that they end up in quarrels. 
552Tm 2:24 As the Lord's servant, you must not quarrel. You must be kind toward all, a good and patient teacher, 
552Tm 2:25 who is gentle as you correct your opponents, for it may be that God will give them the opportunity to repent and come to know the truth. 
552Tm 2:26 And then they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the Devil, who had caught them and made them obey his will. 
552Tm 3:1 Remember that there will be difficult times in the last days. 
552Tm 3:2 People will be selfish, greedy, boastful, and conceited; they will be insulting, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, and irreligious; 
552Tm 3:3 they will be unkind, merciless, slanderers, violent, and fierce; they will hate the good; 
552Tm 3:4 they will be treacherous, reckless, and swollen with pride; they will love pleasure rather than God; 
552Tm 3:5 they will hold to the outward form of our religion, but reject its real power. Keep away from such people. 
552Tm 3:6 Some of them go into people's houses and gain control over weak women who are burdened by the guilt of their sins and driven by all kinds of desires, 
552Tm 3:7 women who are always trying to learn but who can never come to know the truth. 
552Tm 3:8 As Jannes and Jambres were opposed to Moses, so also these people are opposed to the truth - people whose minds do not function and who are failures in the faith. 
552Tm 3:9 But they will not get very far, because everyone will see how stupid they are. That is just what happened to Jannes and Jambres. 
552Tm 3:10 But you have followed my teaching, my conduct, and my purpose in life; you have observed my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, 
552Tm 3:11 my persecutions, and my sufferings. You know all that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the terrible persecutions I endured! But the Lord rescued me from them all. 
552Tm 3:12 Everyone who wants to live a godly life in union with Christ Jesus will be persecuted; 
552Tm 3:13 and evil persons and impostors will keep on going from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves. 
552Tm 3:14 But as for you, continue in the truths that you were taught and firmly believe. You know who your teachers were, 
552Tm 3:15 and you remember that ever since you were a child, you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching the truth, rebuking error, correcting faults, and giving instruction for right living, 
552Tm 3:17 so that the person who serves God may be fully qualified and equipped to do every kind of good deed. 
552Tm 4:1 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and because he is coming to rule as King, I solemnly urge you 
552Tm 4:2 to preach the message, to insist upon proclaiming it (whether the time is right or not), to convince, reproach, and encourage, as you teach with all patience. 
552Tm 4:3 The time will come when people will not listen to sound doctrine, but will follow their own desires and will collect for themselves more and more teachers who will tell them what they are itching to hear. 
552Tm 4:4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give their attention to legends. 
552Tm 4:5 But you must keep control of yourself in all circumstances; endure suffering, do the work of a preacher of the Good News, and perform your whole duty as a servant of God. 
552Tm 4:6 As for me, the hour has come for me to be sacrificed; the time is here for me to leave this life. 
552Tm 4:7 I have done my best in the race, I have run the full distance, and I have kept the faith. 
552Tm 4:8 And now there is waiting for me the victory prize of being put right with God, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that Day - and not only to me, but to all those who wait with love for him to appear. 
552Tm 4:9 Do your best to come to me soon. 
552Tm 4:10 Demas fell in love with this present world and has deserted me, going off to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he can help me in the work. 
552Tm 4:12 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
552Tm 4:13 When you come, bring my coat that I left in Troas with Carpus; bring the books too, and especially the ones made of parchment. 
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the metalworker did me great harm; the Lord will reward him according to what he has done. 
552Tm 4:15 Be on your guard against him yourself, because he was violently opposed to our message. 
552Tm 4:16 No one stood by me the first time I defended myself; all deserted me. May God not count it against them! 
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stayed with me and gave me strength, so that I was able to proclaim the full message for all the Gentiles to hear; and I was rescued from being sentenced to death. 
552Tm 4:18 And the Lord will rescue me from all evil and take me safely into his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 
552Tm 4:19 I send greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and to the family of Onesiphorus. 
552Tm 4:20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus, because he was sick. 
552Tm 4:21 Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia send their greetings, and so do all the other Christians. 
552Tm 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. God's grace be with you all.

56Ti 1:1 From Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I was chosen and sent to help the faith of God's chosen people and to lead them to the truth taught by our religion, 
56Ti 1:2 which is based on the hope for eternal life. God, who does not lie, promised us this life before the beginning of time, 
56Ti 1:3 and at the right time he revealed it in his message. This was entrusted to me, and I proclaim it by order of God our Savior. 
56Ti 1:4 I write to Titus, my true son in the faith that we have in common. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace. 
56Ti 1:5 I left you in Crete, so that you could put in order the things that still needed doing and appoint church elders in every town. Remember my instructions£º 
56Ti 1:6 an elder must be without fault; he must have only one wife, and his children must be believers and not have the reputation of being wild or disobedient. 
56Ti 1:7 For since a church leader is in charge of God's work, he should be without fault. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered, or a drunkard or violent or greedy for money. 
56Ti 1:8 He must be hospitable and love what is good. He must be self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 
56Ti 1:9 He must hold firmly to the message which can be trusted and which agrees with the doctrine. In this way he will be able to encourage others with the true teaching and also to show the error of those who are opposed to it. 
56Ti 1:10 For there are many, especially the converts from Judaism, who rebel and deceive others with their nonsense. 
56Ti 1:11 It is necessary to stop their talk, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching what they should not, and all for the shameful purpose of making money. 
56Ti 1:12 It was a Cretan himself, one of their own prophets, who spoke the truth when he said, "Cretans are always liars, wicked beasts, and lazy gluttons." 
56Ti 1:13 For this reason you must rebuke them sharply, so that they may have a healthy faith 
56Ti 1:14 and no longer hold on to Jewish legends and to human commandments which come from people who have rejected the truth. 
56Ti 1:15 Everything is pure to those who are themselves pure; but nothing is pure to those who are defiled and unbelieving, for their minds and consciences have been defiled. 
56Ti 1:16 They claim that they know God, but their actions deny it. They are hateful and disobedient, not fit to do anything good. 
56Ti 2:1 But you must teach what agrees with sound doctrine. 
56Ti 2:2 Instruct the older men to be sober, sensible, and self-controlled; to be sound in their faith, love, and endurance. 
56Ti 2:3 In the same way instruct the older women to behave as women should who live a holy life. They must not be slanderers or slaves to wine. They must teach what is good, 
56Ti 2:4 in order to train the younger women to love their husbands and children, 
56Ti 2:5 to be self-controlled and pure, and to be good housewives who submit themselves to their husbands, so that no one will speak evil of the message that comes from God. 
56Ti 2:6 In the same way urge the young men to be self-controlled. 
56Ti 2:7 In all things you yourself must be an example of good behavior. Be sincere and serious in your teaching. 
56Ti 2:8 Use sound words that cannot be criticized, so that your enemies may be put to shame by not having anything bad to say about us. 
56Ti 2:9 Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters and please them in all things. They must not talk back to them 
56Ti 2:10 or steal from them. Instead, they must show that they are always good and faithful, so as to bring credit to the teaching about God our Savior in all they do. 
56Ti 2:11 For God has revealed his grace for the salvation of all people. 
56Ti 2:12 That grace instructs us to give up ungodly living and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this world, 
56Ti 2:13 as we wait for the blessed Day we hope for, when the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ will appear. 
56Ti 2:14 He gave himself for us, to rescue us from all wickedness and to make us a pure people who belong to him alone and are eager to do good. 
56Ti 2:15 Teach these things and use your full authority as you encourage and rebuke your hearers. Let none of them look down on you. 
56Ti 3:1 Remind your people to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey them, and to be ready to do good in every way. 
56Ti 3:2 Tell them not to speak evil of anyone, but to be peaceful and friendly, and always to show a gentle attitude toward everyone. 
56Ti 3:3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and wrong. We were slaves to passions and pleasures of all kinds. We spent our lives in malice and envy; others hated us and we hated them. 
56Ti 3:4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior was revealed, 
56Ti 3:5 he saved us. It was not because of any good deeds that we ourselves had done, but because of his own mercy that he saved us, through the Holy Spirit, who gives us new birth and new life by washing us. 
56Ti 3:6 God poured out the Holy Spirit abundantly on us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
56Ti 3:7 so that by his grace we might be put right with God and come into possession of the eternal life we hope for. 
56Ti 3:8 This is a true saying. I want you to give special emphasis to these matters, so that those who believe in God may be concerned with giving their time to doing good deeds, which are good and useful for everyone. 
56Ti 3:9 But avoid stupid arguments, long lists of ancestors, quarrels, and fights about the Law. They are useless and worthless. 
56Ti 3:10 Give at least two warnings to those who cause divisions, and then have nothing more to do with them. 
56Ti 3:11 You know that such people are corrupt, and their sins prove that they are wrong. 
56Ti 3:12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me in Nicopolis, because I have decided to spend the winter there. 
56Ti 3:13 Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos to get started on their travels, and see to it that they have everything they need. 
56Ti 3:14 Our people must learn to spend their time doing good, in order to provide for real needs; they should not live useless lives. 
56Ti 3:15 All who are with me send you greetings. Give our greetings to our friends in the faith. God's grace be with you all. 
57
57Phm 1:1 From Paul, a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy - To our friend and fellow worker Philemon, 
57Phm 1:2 and the church that meets in your house, and our sister Apphia, and our fellow soldier Archippus£º 
57Phm 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. 
57Phm 1:4 Brother Philemon, every time I pray, I mention you and give thanks to my God. 
57Phm 1:5 For I hear of your love for all of God's people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus. 
57Phm 1:6 My prayer is that our fellowship with you as believers will bring about a deeper understanding of every blessing which we have in our life in union with Christ. 
57Phm 1:7 Your love, dear brother, has brought me great joy and much encouragement! You have cheered the hearts of all of God's people. 
57Phm 1:8 For this reason I could be bold enough, as your brother in Christ, to order you to do what should be done. 
57Phm 1:9 But because I love you, I make a request instead. I do this even though I am Paul, the ambassador of Christ Jesus, and at present also a prisoner for his sake. 
57Phm 1:10 So I make a request to you on behalf of Onesimus, who is my own son in Christ; for while in prison I have become his spiritual father. 
57Phm 1:11 At one time he was of no use to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me. 
57Phm 1:12 I am sending him back to you now, and with him goes my heart. 
57Phm 1:13 I would like to keep him here with me, while I am in prison for the gospel's sake, so that he could help me in your place. 
57Phm 1:14 However, I do not want to force you to help me; rather, I would like for you to do it of your own free will. So I will not do anything unless you agree. 
57Phm 1:15 It may be that Onesimus was away from you for a short time so that you might have him back for all time. 
57Phm 1:16 And now he is not just a slave, but much more than a slave£º he is a dear brother in Christ. How much he means to me! And how much more he will mean to you, both as a slave and as a brother in the Lord! 
57Phm 1:17 So, if you think of me as your partner, welcome him back just as you would welcome me. 
57Phm 1:18 If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to my account. 
57Phm 1:19 Here, I will write this with my own hand£º {\I I, Paul, will pay you back. (I should not have to remind you, of course, that you owe your very self to me.)
57Phm 1:20 So, my brother, please do me this favor for the Lord's sake; as a brother in Christ, cheer me up! 
57Phm 1:21 I am sure, as I write this, that you will do what I ask - in fact I know that you will do even more. 
57Phm 1:22 At the same time, get a room ready for me, because I hope that God will answer the prayers of all of you and give me back to you. 
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, who is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings, 
57Phm 1:24 and so do my co-workers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke. 
57Phm 1:25 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

58Heb 1:1 In the past God spoke to our ancestors many times and in many ways through the prophets, 
58Heb 1:2 but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son. He is the one through whom God created the universe, the one whom God has chosen to possess all things at the end. 
58Heb 1:3 He reflects the brightness of God's glory and is the exact likeness of God's own being, sustaining the universe with his powerful word. After achieving forgiveness for the sins of all human beings, he sat down in heaven at the right side of God, the Supreme Power. 
58Heb 1:4 The Son was made greater than the angels, just as the name that God gave him is greater than theirs. 
58Heb 1:5 For God never said to any of his angels, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father." Nor did God say about any angel, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son." 
58Heb 1:6 But when God was about to send his first-born Son into the world, he said, "All of God's angels must worship him." 
58Heb 1:7 But about the angels God said, "God makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire." 
58Heb 1:8 About the Son, however, God said£º "Your kingdom, O God, will last forever and ever! You rule over your people with justice. 
58Heb 1:9 You love what is right and hate what is wrong. That is why God, your God, has chosen you and has given you the joy of an honor far greater than he gave to your companions." 
58Heb 1:10 He also said, "You, Lord, in the beginning created the earth, and with your own hands you made the heavens. 
58Heb 1:11 They will disappear, but you will remain; they will all wear out like clothes. 
58Heb 1:12 You will fold them up like a coat, and they will be changed like clothes. But you are always the same, and your life never ends." 
58Heb 1:13 God never said to any of his angels£º "Sit here at my right side until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet." 
58Heb 1:14 What are the angels, then? They are spirits who serve God and are sent by him to help those who are to receive salvation. 
58Heb 2:1 That is why we must hold on all the more firmly to the truths we have heard, so that we will not be carried away. 
58Heb 2:2 The message given to our ancestors by the angels was shown to be true, and those who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment they deserved. 
58Heb 2:3 How, then, shall we escape if we pay no attention to such a great salvation? The Lord himself first announced this salvation, and those who heard him proved to us that it is true. 
58Heb 2:4 At the same time God added his witness to theirs by performing all kinds of miracles and wonders and by distributing the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will. 
58Heb 2:5 God has not placed the angels as rulers over the new world to come - the world of which we speak. 
58Heb 2:6 Instead, as it is said somewhere in the Scriptures£º "What are human beings, O God, that you should think of them; mere human beings, that you should care for them? 
58Heb 2:7 You made them for a little while lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor, 
58Heb 2:8 and made them rulers over all things." It says that God made them "rulers over all things"; this clearly includes everything. We do not, however, see human beings ruling over all things now. 
58Heb 2:9 But we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, so that through God's grace he should die for everyone. We see him now crowned with glory and honor because of the death he suffered. 
58Heb 2:10 It was only right that God, who creates and preserves all things, should make Jesus perfect through suffering, in order to bring many children to share his glory. For Jesus is the one who leads them to salvation. 
58Heb 2:11 He purifies people from their sins, and both he and those who are made pure all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his family. 
58Heb 2:12 He says to God, "I will tell my people what you have done; I will praise you in their meeting." 
58Heb 2:13 He also says, "I will put my trust in God." And he also says, "Here I am with the children that God has given me." 
58Heb 2:14 Since the children, as he calls them, are people of flesh and blood, Jesus himself became like them and shared their human nature. He did this so that through his death he might destroy the Devil, who has the power over death, 
58Heb 2:15 and in this way set free those who were slaves all their lives because of their fear of death. 
58Heb 2:16 For it is clear that it is not the angels that he helps. Instead, he helps the descendants of Abraham. 
58Heb 2:17 This means that he had to become like his people in every way, in order to be their faithful and merciful High Priest in his service to God, so that the people's sins would be forgiven. 
58Heb 2:18 And now he can help those who are tempted, because he himself was tempted and suffered. 
58Heb 3:1 My Christian friends, who also have been called by God! Think of Jesus, whom God sent to be the High Priest of the faith we profess. 
58Heb 3:2 He was faithful to God, who chose him to do this work, just as Moses was faithful in his work in God's house. 
58Heb 3:3 A man who builds a house receives more honor than the house itself. In the same way Jesus is worthy of much greater honor than Moses. 
58Heb 3:4 Every house, of course, is built by someone - and God is the one who has built all things. 
58Heb 3:5 Moses was faithful in God's house as a servant, and he spoke of the things that God would say in the future. 
58Heb 3:6 But Christ is faithful as the Son in charge of God's house. We are his house if we keep up our courage and our confidence in what we hope for. 
58Heb 3:7 So then, as the Holy Spirit says, "If you hear God's voice today, 
58Heb 3:8 do not be stubborn, as your ancestors were when they rebelled against God, as they were that day in the desert when they put him to the test. 
58Heb 3:9 There they put me to the test and tried me, says God, although they had seen what I did for forty years. 
58Heb 3:10 And so I was angry with those people and said, 'They are always disloyal and refuse to obey my commands.' 
58Heb 3:11 I was angry and made a solemn promise£º 'They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest!' " 
58Heb 3:12 My friends, be careful that none of you have a heart so evil and unbelieving that you will turn away from the living God. 
58Heb 3:13 Instead, in order that none of you be deceived by sin and become stubborn, you must help one another every day, as long as the word "Today" in the scripture applies to us. 
58Heb 3:14 For we are all partners with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the confidence we had at the beginning. 
58Heb 3:15 This is what the scripture says£º "If you hear God's voice today, do not be stubborn, as your ancestors were when they rebelled against God." 
58Heb 3:16 Who were the people who heard God's voice and rebelled against him? All those who were led out of Egypt by Moses. 
58Heb 3:17 With whom was God angry for forty years? With the people who sinned, who fell down dead in the desert. 
58Heb 3:18 When God made his solemn promise, "They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest" - of whom was he speaking? Of those who rebelled. 
58Heb 3:19 We see, then, that they were not able to enter the land, because they did not believe. 
58Heb 4:1 Now, God has offered us the promise that we may receive that rest he spoke about. Let us take care, then, that none of you will be found to have failed to receive that promised rest. 
58Heb 4:2 For we have heard the Good News, just as they did. They heard the message, but it did them no good, because when they heard it, they did not accept it with faith. 
58Heb 4:3 We who believe, then, do receive that rest which God promised. It is just as he said, "I was angry and made a solemn promise£º 'They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest!' " He said this even though his work had been finished from the time he created the world. 
58Heb 4:4 For somewhere in the Scriptures this is said about the seventh day£º "God rested on the seventh day from all his work." 
58Heb 4:5 This same matter is spoken of again£º "They will never enter that land where I would have given them rest." 
58Heb 4:6 Those who first heard the Good News did not receive that rest, because they did not believe. There are, then, others who are allowed to receive it. 
58Heb 4:7 This is shown by the fact that God sets another day, which is called "Today." Many years later he spoke of it through David in the scripture already quoted£º "If you hear God's voice today, do not be stubborn." 
58Heb 4:8 If Joshua had given the people the rest that God had promised, God would not have spoken later about another day. 
58Heb 4:9 As it is, however, there still remains for God's people a rest like God's resting on the seventh day. 
58Heb 4:10 For those who receive that rest which God promised will rest from their own work, just as God rested from his. 
58Heb 4:11 Let us, then, do our best to receive that rest, so that no one of us will fail as they did because of their lack of faith. 
58Heb 4:12 The word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword. It cuts all the way through, to where soul and spirit meet, to where joints and marrow come together. It judges the desires and thoughts of the heart. 
58Heb 4:13 There is nothing that can be hid from God; everything in all creation is exposed and lies open before his eyes. And it is to him that we must all give an account of ourselves. 
58Heb 4:14 Let us, then, hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we have a great High Priest who has gone into the very presence of God - Jesus, the Son of God. 
58Heb 4:15 Our High Priest is not one who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. On the contrary, we have a High Priest who was tempted in every way that we are, but did not sin. 
58Heb 4:16 Let us have confidence, then, and approach God's throne, where there is grace. There we will receive mercy and find grace to help us just when we need it. 
58Heb 5:1 Every high priest is chosen from his fellow-men and appointed to serve God on their behalf, to offer sacrifices and offerings for sins. 
58Heb 5:2 Since he himself is weak in many ways, he is able to be gentle with those who are ignorant and make mistakes. 
58Heb 5:3 And because he is himself weak, he must offer sacrifices not only for the sins of the people but also for his own sins. 
58Heb 5:4 No one chooses for himself the honor of being a high priest. It is only by God's call that a man is made a high priest - just as Aaron was. 
58Heb 5:5 In the same way, Christ did not take upon himself the honor of being a high priest. Instead, God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father." 
58Heb 5:6 He also said in another place, "You will be a priest forever, in the priestly order of Melchizedek." 
58Heb 5:7 In his life on earth Jesus made his prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God, who could save him from death. Because he was humble and devoted, God heard him. 
58Heb 5:8 But even though he was God's Son, he learned through his sufferings to be obedient. 
58Heb 5:9 When he was made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him, 
58Heb 5:10 and God declared him to be high priest, in the priestly order of Melchizedek. 
58Heb 5:11 There is much we have to say about this matter, but it is hard to explain to you, because you are so slow to understand. 
58Heb 5:12 There has been enough time for you to be teachers - yet you still need someone to teach you the first lessons of God's message. Instead of eating solid food, you still have to drink milk. 
58Heb 5:13 Anyone who has to drink milk is still a child, without any experience in the matter of right and wrong. 
58Heb 5:14 Solid food, on the other hand, is for adults, who through practice are able to distinguish between good and evil. 
58Heb 6:1 Let us go forward, then, to mature teaching and leave behind us the first lessons of the Christian message. We should not lay again the foundation of turning away from useless works and believing in God; 
58Heb 6:2 of the teaching about baptisms and the laying on of hands; of the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment. 
58Heb 6:3 Let us go forward! And this is what we will do, if God allows. 
58Heb 6:4 For how can those who abandon their faith be brought back to repent again? They were once in God's light; they tasted heaven's gift and received their share of the Holy Spirit; 
58Heb 6:5 they knew from experience that God's word is good, and they had felt the powers of the coming age. 
58Heb 6:6 And then they abandoned their faith! It is impossible to bring them back to repent again, because they are again crucifying the Son of God and exposing him to public shame. 
58Heb 6:7 God blesses the soil which drinks in the rain that often falls on it and which grows plants that are useful to those for whom it is cultivated. 
58Heb 6:8 But if it grows thorns and weeds, it is worth nothing; it is in danger of being cursed by God and will be destroyed by fire. 
58Heb 6:9 But even if we speak like this, dear friends, we feel sure about you. We know that you have the better blessings that belong to your salvation. 
58Heb 6:10 God is not unfair. He will not forget the work you did or the love you showed for him in the help you gave and are still giving to other Christians. 
58Heb 6:11 Our great desire is that each of you keep up your eagerness to the end, so that the things you hope for will come true. 
58Heb 6:12 We do not want you to become lazy, but to be like those who believe and are patient, and so receive what God has promised. 
58Heb 6:13 When God made his promise to Abraham, he made a vow to do what he had promised. Since there was no one greater than himself, he used his own name when he made his vow. 
58Heb 6:14 He said, "I promise you that I will bless you and give you many descendants." 
58Heb 6:15 Abraham was patient, and so he received what God had promised. 
58Heb 6:16 When we make a vow, we use the name of someone greater than ourselves, and the vow settles all arguments. 
58Heb 6:17 To those who were to receive what he promised, God wanted to make it very clear that he would never change his purpose; so he added his vow to the promise. 
58Heb 6:18 There are these two things, then, that cannot change and about which God cannot lie. So we who have found safety with him are greatly encouraged to hold firmly to the hope placed before us. 
58Heb 6:19 We have this hope as an anchor for our lives. It is safe and sure, and goes through the curtain of the heavenly temple into the inner sanctuary. 
58Heb 6:20 On our behalf Jesus has gone in there before us and has become a high priest forever, in the priestly order of Melchizedek. 
58Heb 7:1 This Melchizedek was king of Salem and a priest of the Most High God. As Abraham was coming back from the battle in which he defeated the four kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him, 
58Heb 7:2 and Abraham gave him one tenth of all he had taken. (The first meaning of Melchizedek's name is "King of Righteousness"; and because he was king of Salem, his name also means "King of Peace.") 
58Heb 7:3 There is no record of Melchizedek's father or mother or of any of his ancestors; no record of his birth or of his death. He is like the Son of God; he remains a priest forever. 
58Heb 7:4 You see, then, how great he was. Abraham, our famous ancestor, gave him one tenth of all he got in the battle. 
58Heb 7:5 And those descendants of Levi who are priests are commanded by the Law to collect one tenth from the people of Israel, that is, from their own people, even though they are also descendants of Abraham. 
58Heb 7:6 Melchizedek was not descended from Levi, but he collected one tenth from Abraham and blessed him, the man who received God's promises. 
58Heb 7:7 There is no doubt that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed. 
58Heb 7:8 In the case of the priests the tenth is collected by men who die; but as for Melchizedek the tenth was collected by one who lives, as the scripture says. 
58Heb 7:9 And, so to speak, when Abraham paid the tenth, Levi (whose descendants collect the tenth) also paid it. 
58Heb 7:10 For Levi had not yet been born, but was, so to speak, in the body of his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him. 
58Heb 7:11 It was on the basis of the levitical priesthood that the Law was given to the people of Israel. Now, if the work of the levitical priests had been perfect, there would have been no need for a different kind of priest to appear, one who is in the priestly order of Melchizedek, not of Aaron. 
58Heb 7:12 For when the priesthood is changed, there also has to be a change in the law. 
58Heb 7:13 And our Lord, of whom these things are said, belonged to a different tribe, and no member of his tribe ever served as a priest. 
58Heb 7:14 It is well known that he was born a member of the tribe of Judah; and Moses did not mention this tribe when he spoke of priests. 
58Heb 7:15 The matter becomes even plainer; a different priest has appeared, who is like Melchizedek. 
58Heb 7:16 He was made a priest, not by human rules and regulations, but through the power of a life which has no end. 
58Heb 7:17 For the scripture says, "You will be a priest forever, in the priestly order of Melchizedek." 
58Heb 7:18 The old rule, then, is set aside, because it was weak and useless. 
58Heb 7:19 For the Law of Moses could not make anything perfect. And now a better hope has been provided through which we come near to God. 
58Heb 7:20 In addition, there is also God's vow. There was no such vow when the others were made priests. 
58Heb 7:21 But Jesus became a priest by means of a vow when God said to him, "The Lord has made a solemn promise and will not take it back£º 'You will be a priest forever.' " 
58Heb 7:22 This difference, then, also makes Jesus the guarantee of a better covenant. 
58Heb 7:23 There is another difference£º there were many of those other priests, because they died and could not continue their work. 
58Heb 7:24 But Jesus lives on forever, and his work as priest does not pass on to someone else. 
58Heb 7:25 And so he is able, now and always, to save those who come to God through him, because he lives forever to plead with God for them. 
58Heb 7:26 Jesus, then, is the High Priest that meets our needs. He is holy; he has no fault or sin in him; he has been set apart from sinners and raised above the heavens. 
58Heb 7:27 He is not like other high priests; he does not need to offer sacrifices every day for his own sins first and then for the sins of the people. He offered one sacrifice, once and for all, when he offered himself. 
58Heb 7:28 The Law of Moses appoints men who are imperfect to be high priests; but God's promise made with the vow, which came later than the Law, appoints the Son, who has been made perfect forever. 
58Heb 8:1 The whole point of what we are saying is that we have such a High Priest, who sits at the right of the throne of the Divine Majesty in heaven. 
58Heb 8:2 He serves as high priest in the Most Holy Place, that is, in the real tent which was put up by the Lord, not by human hands. 
58Heb 8:3 Every high priest is appointed to present offerings and animal sacrifices to God, and so our High Priest must also have something to offer. 
58Heb 8:4 If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts required by the Jewish Law. 
58Heb 8:5 The work they do as priests is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. It is the same as it was with Moses. When he was about to build the Sacred Tent, God told him, "Be sure to make everything according to the pattern you were shown on the mountain." 
58Heb 8:6 But now, Jesus has been given priestly work which is superior to theirs, just as the covenant which he arranged between God and his people is a better one, because it is based on promises of better things. 
58Heb 8:7 If there had been nothing wrong with the first covenant, there would have been no need for a second one. 
58Heb 8:8 But God finds fault with his people when he says, "The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will draw up a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 
58Heb 8:9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. They were not faithful to the covenant I made with them, and so I paid no attention to them. 
58Heb 8:10 Now, this is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel in the days to come, says the Lord£º I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
58Heb 8:11 None of them will have to teach their friends or tell their neighbors, 'Know the Lord.' For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest. 
58Heb 8:12 I will forgive their sins and will no longer remember their wrongs." 
58Heb 8:13 By speaking of a new covenant, God has made the first one old; and anything that becomes old and worn out will soon disappear. 
58Heb 9:1 The first covenant had rules for worship and a place made for worship as well. 
58Heb 9:2 A tent was put up, the outer one, which was called the Holy Place. In it were the lampstand and the table with the bread offered to God. 
58Heb 9:3 Behind the second curtain was the tent called the Most Holy Place. 
58Heb 9:4 In it were the gold altar for the burning of incense and the Covenant Box all covered with gold and containing the gold jar with the manna in it, Aaron's stick that had sprouted leaves, and the two stone tablets with the commandments written on them. 
58Heb 9:5 Above the Box were the winged creatures representing God's presence, with their wings spread over the place where sins were forgiven. But now is not the time to explain everything in detail. 
58Heb 9:6 This is how those things have been arranged. The priests go into the outer tent every day to perform their duties, 
58Heb 9:7 but only the high priest goes into the inner tent, and he does so only once a year. He takes with him blood which he offers to God on behalf of himself and for the sins which the people have committed without knowing they were sinning. 
58Heb 9:8 The Holy Spirit clearly teaches from all these arrangements that the way into the Most Holy Place has not yet been opened as long as the outer tent still stands. 
58Heb 9:9 This is a symbol which points to the present time. It means that the offerings and animal sacrifices presented to God cannot make the worshiper's heart perfect, 
58Heb 9:10 since they have to do only with food, drink, and various purification ceremonies. These are all outward rules, which apply only until the time when God will establish the new order. 
58Heb 9:11 But Christ has already come as the High Priest of the good things that are already here. The tent in which he serves is greater and more perfect; it is not a tent made by human hands, that is, it is not a part of this created world. 
58Heb 9:12 When Christ went through the tent and entered once and for all into the Most Holy Place, he did not take the blood of goats and bulls to offer as a sacrifice; rather, he took his own blood and obtained eternal salvation for us. 
58Heb 9:13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a burnt calf are sprinkled on the people who are ritually unclean, and this purifies them by taking away their ritual impurity. 
58Heb 9:14 Since this is true, how much more is accomplished by the blood of Christ! Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice to God. His blood will purify our consciences from useless rituals, so that we may serve the living God. 
58Heb 9:15 For this reason Christ is the one who arranges a new covenant, so that those who have been called by God may receive the eternal blessings that God has promised. This can be done because there has been a death which sets people free from the wrongs they did while the first covenant was in effect. 
58Heb 9:16 In the case of a will it is necessary to prove that the person who made it has died, 
58Heb 9:17 for a will means nothing while the person who made it is alive; it goes into effect only after his death. 
58Heb 9:18 That is why even the first covenant went into effect only with the use of blood. 
58Heb 9:19 First, Moses proclaimed to the people all the commandments as set forth in the Law. Then he took the blood of bulls and goats, mixed it with water, and sprinkled it on the book of the Law and all the people, using a sprig of hyssop and some red wool. 
58Heb 9:20 He said, "This is the blood which seals the covenant that God has commanded you to obey." 
58Heb 9:21 In the same way Moses also sprinkled the blood on the Sacred Tent and over all the things used in worship. 
58Heb 9:22 Indeed, according to the Law almost everything is purified by blood, and sins are forgiven only if blood is poured out. 
58Heb 9:23 Those things, which are copies of the heavenly originals, had to be purified in that way. But the heavenly things themselves require much better sacrifices. 
58Heb 9:24 For Christ did not go into a Holy Place made by human hands, which was a copy of the real one. He went into heaven itself, where he now appears on our behalf in the presence of God. 
58Heb 9:25 The Jewish high priest goes into the Most Holy Place every year with the blood of an animal. But Christ did not go in to offer himself many times, 
58Heb 9:26 for then he would have had to suffer many times ever since the creation of the world. Instead, now when all ages of time are nearing the end, he has appeared once and for all, to remove sin through the sacrifice of himself. 
58Heb 9:27 Everyone must die once, and after that be judged by God. 
58Heb 9:28 In the same manner Christ also was offered in sacrifice once to take away the sins of many. He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are waiting for him. 
58Heb 10:1 The Jewish Law is not a full and faithful model of the real things; it is only a faint outline of the good things to come. The same sacrifices are offered forever, year after year. How can the Law, then, by means of these sacrifices make perfect the people who come to God? 
58Heb 10:2 If the people worshiping God had really been purified from their sins, they would not feel guilty of sin any more, and all sacrifices would stop. 
58Heb 10:3 As it is, however, the sacrifices serve year after year to remind people of their sins. 
58Heb 10:4 For the blood of bulls and goats can never take away sins. 
58Heb 10:5 For this reason, when Christ was about to come into the world, he said to God£º "You do not want sacrifices and offerings, but you have prepared a body for me. 
58Heb 10:6 You are not pleased with animals burned whole on the altar or with sacrifices to take away sins. 
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, 'Here I am, to do your will, O God, just as it is written of me in the book of the Law.' " 
58Heb 10:8 First he said, "You neither want nor are you pleased with sacrifices and offerings or with animals burned on the altar and the sacrifices to take away sins." He said this even though all these sacrifices are offered according to the Law. 
58Heb 10:9 Then he said, "Here I am, O God, to do your will." So God does away with all the old sacrifices and puts the sacrifice of Christ in their place. 
58Heb 10:10 Because Jesus Christ did what God wanted him to do, we are all purified from sin by the offering that he made of his own body once and for all. 
58Heb 10:11 Every Jewish priest performs his services every day and offers the same sacrifices many times; but these sacrifices can never take away sins. 
58Heb 10:12 Christ, however, offered one sacrifice for sins, an offering that is effective forever, and then he sat down at the right side of God. 
58Heb 10:13 There he now waits until God puts his enemies as a footstool under his feet. 
58Heb 10:14 With one sacrifice, then, he has made perfect forever those who are purified from sin. 
58Heb 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also gives us his witness. First he says, 
58Heb 10:16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them in the days to come, says the Lord£º I will put my laws in their hearts and write them on their minds." 
58Heb 10:17 And then he says, "I will not remember their sins and evil deeds any longer." 
58Heb 10:18 So when these have been forgiven, an offering to take away sins is no longer needed. 
58Heb 10:19 We have, then, my friends, complete freedom to go into the Most Holy Place by means of the death of Jesus. 
58Heb 10:20 He opened for us a new way, a living way, through the curtain - that is, through his own body. 
58Heb 10:21 We have a great priest in charge of the house of God. 
58Heb 10:22 So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, with hearts that have been purified from a guilty conscience and with bodies washed with clean water. 
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold on firmly to the hope we profess, because we can trust God to keep his promise. 
58Heb 10:24 Let us be concerned for one another, to help one another to show love and to do good. 
58Heb 10:25 Let us not give up the habit of meeting together, as some are doing. Instead, let us encourage one another all the more, since you see that the Day of the Lord is coming nearer. 
58Heb 10:26 For there is no longer any sacrifice that will take away sins if we purposely go on sinning after the truth has been made known to us. 
58Heb 10:27 Instead, all that is left is to wait in fear for the coming Judgment and the fierce fire which will destroy those who oppose God! 
58Heb 10:28 Anyone who disobeys the Law of Moses is put to death without any mercy when judged guilty from the evidence of two or more witnesses. 
58Heb 10:29 What, then, of those who despise the Son of God? who treat as a cheap thing the blood of God's covenant which purified them from sin? who insult the Spirit of grace? Just think how much worse is the punishment they will deserve! 
58Heb 10:30 For we know who said, "I will take revenge, I will repay"; and who also said, "The Lord will judge his people." 
58Heb 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God! 
58Heb 10:32 Remember how it was with you in the past. In those days, after God's light had shone on you, you suffered many things, yet were not defeated by the struggle. 
58Heb 10:33 You were at times publicly insulted and mistreated, and at other times you were ready to join those who were being treated in this way. 
58Heb 10:34 You shared the sufferings of prisoners, and when all your belongings were seized, you endured your loss gladly, because you knew that you still possessed something much better, which would last forever. 
58Heb 10:35 Do not lose your courage, then, because it brings with it a great reward. 
58Heb 10:36 You need to be patient, in order to do the will of God and receive what he promises. 
58Heb 10:37 For, as the scripture says, "Just a little while longer, and he who is coming will come; he will not delay. 
58Heb 10:38 My righteous people, however, will believe and live; but if any of them turns back, I will not be pleased with them." 
58Heb 10:39 We are not people who turn back and are lost. Instead, we have faith and are saved. 
58Heb 11:1 To have faith is to be sure of the things we hope for, to be certain of the things we cannot see. 
58Heb 11:2 It was by their faith that people of ancient times won God's approval. 
58Heb 11:3 It is by faith that we understand that the universe was created by God's word, so that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen. 
58Heb 11:4 It was faith that made Abel offer to God a better sacrifice than Cain's. Through his faith he won God's approval as a righteous man, because God himself approved of his gifts. By means of his faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead. 
58Heb 11:5 It was faith that kept Enoch from dying. Instead, he was taken up to God, and nobody could find him, because God had taken him up. The scripture says that before Enoch was taken up, he had pleased God. 
58Heb 11:6 No one can please God without faith, for whoever comes to God must have faith that God exists and rewards those who seek him. 
58Heb 11:7 It was faith that made Noah hear God's warnings about things in the future that he could not see. He obeyed God and built a boat in which he and his family were saved. As a result, the world was condemned, and Noah received from God the righteousness that comes by faith. 
58Heb 11:8 It was faith that made Abraham obey when God called him to go out to a country which God had promised to give him. He left his own country without knowing where he was going. 
58Heb 11:9 By faith he lived as a foreigner in the country that God had promised him. He lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who received the same promise from God. 
58Heb 11:10 For Abraham was waiting for the city which God has designed and built, the city with permanent foundations. 
58Heb 11:11 It was faith that made Abraham able to become a father, even though he was too old and Sarah herself could not have children. He trusted God to keep his promise. 
58Heb 11:12 Though Abraham was practically dead, from this one man came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky, as many as the numberless grains of sand on the seashore. 
58Heb 11:13 It was in faith that all these persons died. They did not receive the things God had promised, but from a long way off they saw them and welcomed them, and admitted openly that they were foreigners and refugees on earth. 
58Heb 11:14 Those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own. 
58Heb 11:15 They did not keep thinking about the country they had left; if they had, they would have had the chance to return. 
58Heb 11:16 Instead, it was a better country they longed for, the heavenly country. And so God is not ashamed for them to call him their God, because he has prepared a city for them. 
58Heb 11:17 It was faith that made Abraham offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice when God put Abraham to the test. Abraham was the one to whom God had made the promise, yet he was ready to offer his only son as a sacrifice. 
58Heb 11:18 God had said to him, "It is through Isaac that you will have the descendants I promised." 
58Heb 11:19 Abraham reckoned that God was able to raise Isaac from death - and, so to speak, Abraham did receive Isaac back from death. 
58Heb 11:20 It was faith that made Isaac promise blessings for the future to Jacob and Esau. 
58Heb 11:21 It was faith that made Jacob bless each of the sons of Joseph just before he died. He leaned on the top of his walking stick and worshiped God. 
58Heb 11:22 It was faith that made Joseph, when he was about to die, speak of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, and leave instructions about what should be done with his body. 
58Heb 11:23 It was faith that made the parents of Moses hide him for three months after he was born. They saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's order. 
58Heb 11:24 It was faith that made Moses, when he had grown up, refuse to be called the son of the king's daughter. 
58Heb 11:25 He preferred to suffer with God's people rather than to enjoy sin for a little while. 
58Heb 11:26 He reckoned that to suffer scorn for the Messiah was worth far more than all the treasures of Egypt, for he kept his eyes on the future reward. 
58Heb 11:27 It was faith that made Moses leave Egypt without being afraid of the king's anger. As though he saw the invisible God, he refused to turn back. 
58Heb 11:28 It was faith that made him establish the Passover and order the blood to be sprinkled on the doors, so that the Angel of Death would not kill the first-born sons of the Israelites. 
58Heb 11:29 It was faith that made the Israelites able to cross the Red Sea as if on dry land; when the Egyptians tried to do it, the water swallowed them up. 
58Heb 11:30 It was faith that made the walls of Jericho fall down after the Israelites had marched around them for seven days. 
58Heb 11:31 It was faith that kept the prostitute Rahab from being killed with those who disobeyed God, for she gave the Israelite spies a friendly welcome. 
58Heb 11:32 Should I go on? There isn't enough time for me to speak of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. 
58Heb 11:33 Through faith they fought whole countries and won. They did what was right and received what God had promised. They shut the mouths of lions, 
58Heb 11:34 put out fierce fires, escaped being killed by the sword. They were weak, but became strong; they were mighty in battle and defeated the armies of foreigners. 
58Heb 11:35 Through faith women received their dead relatives raised back to life. Others, refusing to accept freedom, died under torture in order to be raised to a better life. 
58Heb 11:36 Some were mocked and whipped, and others were put in chains and taken off to prison. 
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they were killed by the sword. They went around clothed in skins of sheep or goats - poor, persecuted, and mistreated. 
58Heb 11:38 The world was not good enough for them! They wandered like refugees in the deserts and hills, living in caves and holes in the ground. 
58Heb 11:39 What a record all of these have won by their faith! Yet they did not receive what God had promised, 
58Heb 11:40 because God had decided on an even better plan for us. His purpose was that only in company with us would they be made perfect. 
58Heb 12:1 As for us, we have this large crowd of witnesses around us. So then, let us rid ourselves of everything that gets in the way, and of the sin which holds on to us so tightly, and let us run with determination the race that lies before us. 
58Heb 12:2 Let us keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, on whom our faith depends from beginning to end. He did not give up because of the cross! On the contrary, because of the joy that was waiting for him, he thought nothing of the disgrace of dying on the cross, and he is now seated at the right side of God's throne. 
58Heb 12:3 Think of what he went through; how he put up with so much hatred from sinners! So do not let yourselves become discouraged and give up. 
58Heb 12:4 For in your struggle against sin you have not yet had to resist to the point of being killed. 
58Heb 12:5 Have you forgotten the encouraging words which God speaks to you as his children? "My child, pay attention when the Lord corrects you, and do not be discouraged when he rebukes you. 
58Heb 12:6 Because the Lord corrects everyone he loves, and punishes everyone he accepts as a child." 
58Heb 12:7 Endure what you suffer as being a father's punishment; your suffering shows that God is treating you as his children. Was there ever a child who was not punished by his father? 
58Heb 12:8 If you are not punished, as all his children are, it means you are not real children, but bastards. 
58Heb 12:9 In the case of our human fathers, they punished us and we respected them. How much more, then, should we submit to our spiritual Father and live! 
58Heb 12:10 Our human fathers punished us for a short time, as it seemed right to them; but God does it for our own good, so that we may share his holiness. 
58Heb 12:11 When we are punished, it seems to us at the time something to make us sad, not glad. Later, however, those who have been disciplined by such punishment reap the peaceful reward of a righteous life. 
58Heb 12:12 Lift up your tired hands, then, and strengthen your trembling knees! 
58Heb 12:13 Keep walking on straight paths, so that the lame foot may not be disabled, but instead be healed. 
58Heb 12:14 Try to be at peace with everyone, and try to live a holy life, because no one will see the Lord without it. 
58Heb 12:15 Guard against turning back from the grace of God. Let no one become like a bitter plant that grows up and causes many troubles with its poison. 
58Heb 12:16 Let no one become immoral or unspiritual like Esau, who for a single meal sold his rights as the older son. 
58Heb 12:17 Afterward, you know, he wanted to receive his father's blessing; but he was turned back, because he could not find any way to change what he had done, even though in tears he looked for it. 
58Heb 12:18 You have not come, as the people of Israel came, to what you can feel, to Mount Sinai with its blazing fire, the darkness and the gloom, the storm, 
58Heb 12:19 the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice. When the people heard the voice, they begged not to hear another word, 
58Heb 12:20 because they could not bear the order which said, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death." 
58Heb 12:21 The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling and afraid!" 
58Heb 12:22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, with its thousands of angels. 
58Heb 12:23 You have come to the joyful gathering of God's first-born, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, who is the judge of all people, and to the spirits of good people made perfect. 
58Heb 12:24 You have come to Jesus, who arranged the new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that promises much better things than does the blood of Abel. 
58Heb 12:25 Be careful, then, and do not refuse to hear him who speaks. Those who refused to hear the one who gave the divine message on earth did not escape. How much less shall we escape, then, if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven! 
58Heb 12:26 His voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, "I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven as well." 
58Heb 12:27 The words "once more" plainly show that the created things will be shaken and removed, so that the things that cannot be shaken will remain. 
58Heb 12:28 Let us be thankful, then, because we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Let us be grateful and worship God in a way that will please him, with reverence and awe; 
58Heb 12:29 because our God is indeed a destroying fire. 
58Heb 13:1 Keep on loving one another as Christians. 
58Heb 13:2 Remember to welcome strangers in your homes. There were some who did that and welcomed angels without knowing it. 
58Heb 13:3 Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them. Remember those who are suffering, as though you were suffering as they are. 
58Heb 13:4 Marriage is to be honored by all, and husbands and wives must be faithful to each other. God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery. 
58Heb 13:5 Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. For God has said, "I will never leave you; I will never abandon you." 
58Heb 13:6 Let us be bold, then, and say, "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?" 
58Heb 13:7 Remember your former leaders, who spoke God's message to you. Think back on how they lived and died, and imitate their faith. 
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 
58Heb 13:9 Do not let all kinds of strange teachings lead you from the right way. It is good to receive inner strength from God's grace, and not by obeying rules about foods; those who obey these rules have not been helped by them. 
58Heb 13:10 The priests who serve in the Jewish place of worship have no right to eat any of the sacrifice on our altar. 
58Heb 13:11 The Jewish high priest brings the blood of the animals into the Most Holy Place to offer it as a sacrifice for sins; but the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp. 
58Heb 13:12 For this reason Jesus also died outside the city, in order to purify the people from sin with his own blood. 
58Heb 13:13 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp and share his shame. 
58Heb 13:14 For there is no permanent city for us here on earth; we are looking for the city which is to come. 
58Heb 13:15 Let us, then, always offer praise to God as our sacrifice through Jesus, which is the offering presented by lips that confess him as Lord. 
58Heb 13:16 Do not forget to do good and to help one another, because these are the sacrifices that please God. 
58Heb 13:17 Obey your leaders and follow their orders. They watch over your souls without resting, since they must give to God an account of their service. If you obey them, they will do their work gladly; if not, they will do it with sadness, and that would be of no help to you. 
58Heb 13:18 Keep on praying for us. We are sure we have a clear conscience, because we want to do the right thing at all times. 
58Heb 13:19 And I beg you even more earnestly to pray that God will send me back to you soon. 
58Heb 13:20 God has raised from death our Lord Jesus, who is the Great Shepherd of the sheep as the result of his blood, by which the eternal covenant is sealed. May the God of peace provide you with every good thing you need in order to do his will, and may he, through Jesus Christ, do in us what pleases him. 
58Heb 13:21 And to Christ be the glory forever and ever! Amen. 
58Heb 13:22 I beg you, my friends, to listen patiently to this message of encouragement; for this letter I have written you is not very long. 
58Heb 13:23 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been let out of prison. If he comes soon enough, I will have him with me when I see you. 
58Heb 13:24 Give our greetings to all your leaders and to all God's people. The believers from Italy send you their greetings. 
58Heb 13:25 May God's grace be with you all.

59Jms 1:1 From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ£º Greetings to all God's people scattered over the whole world. 
59Jms 1:2 My friends, consider yourselves fortunate when all kinds of trials come your way, 
59Jms 1:3 for you know that when your faith succeeds in facing such trials, the result is the ability to endure. 
59Jms 1:4 Make sure that your endurance carries you all the way without failing, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. 
59Jms 1:5 But if any of you lack wisdom, you should pray to God, who will give it to you; because God gives generously and graciously to all. 
59Jms 1:6 But when you pray, you must believe and not doubt at all. Whoever doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven and blown about by the wind. 
59Jms 1:7 If you are like that, unable to make up your mind and undecided in all you do, 
59Jms 1:8 you must not think that you will receive anything from the Lord. 
59Jms 1:9 Those Christians who are poor must be glad when God lifts them up, 
59Jms 1:10 and the rich Christians must be glad when God brings them down. For the rich will pass away like the flower of a wild plant. 
59Jms 1:11 The sun rises with its blazing heat and burns the plant; its flower falls off, and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way the rich will be destroyed while they go about their business. 
59Jms 1:12 Happy are those who remain faithful under trials, because when they succeed in passing such a test, they will receive as their reward the life which God has promised to those who love him. 
59Jms 1:13 If we are tempted by such trials, we must not say, "This temptation comes from God." For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. 
59Jms 1:14 But we are tempted when we are drawn away and trapped by our own evil desires. 
59Jms 1:15 Then our evil desires conceive and give birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. 
59Jms 1:16 Do not be deceived, my dear friends! 
59Jms 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect present comes from heaven; it comes down from God, the Creator of the heavenly lights, who does not change or cause darkness by turning. 
59Jms 1:18 By his own will he brought us into being through the word of truth, so that we should have first place among all his creatures. 
59Jms 1:19 Remember this, my dear friends! Everyone must be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to become angry. 
59Jms 1:20 Human anger does not achieve God's righteous purpose. 
59Jms 1:21 So get rid of every filthy habit and all wicked conduct. Submit to God and accept the word that he plants in your hearts, which is able to save you. 
59Jms 1:22 Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to his word; instead, put it into practice. 
59Jms 1:23 If you listen to the word, but do not put it into practice you are like people who look in a mirror and see themselves as they are. 
59Jms 1:24 They take a good look at themselves and then go away and at once forget what they look like. 
59Jms 1:25 But if you look closely into the perfect law that sets people free, and keep on paying attention to it and do not simply listen and then forget it, but put it into practice - you will be blessed by God in what you do. 
59Jms 1:26 Do any of you think you are religious? If you do not control your tongue, your religion is worthless and you deceive yourself. 
59Jms 1:27 What God the Father considers to be pure and genuine religion is this£º to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world. 
59Jms 2:1 My friends, as believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, you must never treat people in different ways according to their outward appearance. 
59Jms 2:2 Suppose a rich man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes comes to your meeting, and a poor man in ragged clothes also comes. 
59Jms 2:3 If you show more respect to the well-dressed man and say to him, "Have this best seat here," but say to the poor man, "Stand over there, or sit here on the floor by my feet," 
59Jms 2:4 then you are guilty of creating distinctions among yourselves and of making judgments based on evil motives. 
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my dear friends! God chose the poor people of this world to be rich in faith and to possess the kingdom which he promised to those who love him. 
59Jms 2:6 But you dishonor the poor! Who are the ones who oppress you and drag you before the judges? The rich! 
59Jms 2:7 They are the ones who speak evil of that good name which has been given to you. 
59Jms 2:8 You will be doing the right thing if you obey the law of the Kingdom, which is found in the scripture, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." 
59Jms 2:9 But if you treat people according to their outward appearance, you are guilty of sin, and the Law condemns you as a lawbreaker. 
59Jms 2:10 Whoever breaks one commandment is guilty of breaking them all. 
59Jms 2:11 For the same one who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not commit murder." Even if you do not commit adultery, you have become a lawbreaker if you commit murder. 
59Jms 2:12 Speak and act as people who will be judged by the law that sets us free. 
59Jms 2:13 For God will not show mercy when he judges the person who has not been merciful; but mercy triumphs over judgment. 
59Jms 2:14 My friends, what good is it for one of you to say that you have faith if your actions do not prove it? Can that faith save you? 
59Jms 2:15 Suppose there are brothers or sisters who need clothes and don't have enough to eat. 
59Jms 2:16 What good is there in your saying to them, "God bless you! Keep warm and eat well!" - if you don't give them the necessities of life? 
59Jms 2:17 So it is with faith£º if it is alone and includes no actions, then it is dead. 
59Jms 2:18 But someone will say, "One person has faith, another has actions." My answer is, "Show me how anyone can have faith without actions. I will show you my faith by my actions." 
59Jms 2:19 Do you believe that there is only one God? Good! The demons also believe - and tremble with fear. 
59Jms 2:20 You fool! Do you want to be shown that faith without actions is useless? 
59Jms 2:21 How was our ancestor Abraham put right with God? It was through his actions, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar. 
59Jms 2:22 Can't you see? His faith and his actions worked together; his faith was made perfect through his actions. 
59Jms 2:23 And the scripture came true that said, "Abraham believed God, and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous." And so Abraham was called God's friend. 
59Jms 2:24 You see, then, that it is by our actions that we are put right with God, and not by our faith alone. 
59Jms 2:25 It was the same with the prostitute Rahab. She was put right with God through her actions, by welcoming the Israelite spies and helping them to escape by a different road. 
59Jms 2:26 So then, as the body without the spirit is dead, also faith without actions is dead. 
59Jms 3:1 My friends, not many of you should become teachers. As you know, we teachers will be judged with greater strictness than others. 
59Jms 3:2 All of us often make mistakes. But if a person never makes a mistake in what he says, he is perfect and is also able to control his whole being. 
59Jms 3:3 We put a bit into the mouth of a horse to make it obey us, and we are able to make it go where we want. 
59Jms 3:4 Or think of a ship£º big as it is and driven by such strong winds, it can be steered by a very small rudder, and it goes wherever the pilot wants it to go. 
59Jms 3:5 So it is with the tongue£º small as it is, it can boast about great things. Just think how large a forest can be set on fire by a tiny flame! 
59Jms 3:6 And the tongue is like a fire. It is a world of wrong, occupying its place in our bodies and spreading evil through our whole being. It sets on fire the entire course of our existence with the fire that comes to it from hell itself. 
59Jms 3:7 We humans are able to tame and have tamed all other creatures - wild animals and birds, reptiles and fish. 
59Jms 3:8 But no one has ever been able to tame the tongue. It is evil and uncontrollable, full of deadly poison. 
59Jms 3:9 We use it to give thanks to our Lord and Father and also to curse other people, who are created in the likeness of God. 
59Jms 3:10 Words of thanksgiving and cursing pour out from the same mouth. My friends, this should not happen! 
59Jms 3:11 No spring of water pours out sweet water and bitter water from the same opening. 
59Jms 3:12 A fig tree, my friends, cannot bear olives; a grapevine cannot bear figs, nor can a salty spring produce sweet water. 
59Jms 3:13 Are there any of you who are wise and understanding? You are to prove it by your good life, by your good deeds performed with humility and wisdom. 
59Jms 3:14 But if in your heart you are jealous, bitter, and selfish, don't sin against the truth by boasting of your wisdom. 
59Jms 3:15 Such wisdom does not come down from heaven; it belongs to the world, it is unspiritual and demonic. 
59Jms 3:16 Where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is also disorder and every kind of evil. 
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom from above is pure first of all; it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy. 
59Jms 3:18 And goodness is the harvest that is produced from the seeds the peacemakers plant in peace. 
59Jms 4:1 Where do all the fights and quarrels among you come from? They come from your desires for pleasure, which are constantly fighting within you. 
59Jms 4:2 You want things, but you cannot have them, so you are ready to kill; you strongly desire things, but you cannot get them, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have what you want because you do not ask God for it. 
59Jms 4:3 And when you ask, you do not receive it, because your motives are bad; you ask for things to use for your own pleasures. 
59Jms 4:4 Unfaithful people! Don't you know that to be the world's friend means to be God's enemy? If you want to be the world's friend, you make yourself God's enemy. 
59Jms 4:5 Don't think that there is no truth in the scripture that says, "The spirit that God placed in us is filled with fierce desires." 
59Jms 4:6 But the grace that God gives is even stronger. As the scripture says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." 
59Jms 4:7 So then, submit yourselves to God. Resist the Devil, and he will run away from you. 
59Jms 4:8 Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners! Purify your hearts, you hypocrites! 
59Jms 4:9 Be sorrowful, cry, and weep; change your laughter into crying, your joy into gloom! 
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. 
59Jms 4:11 Do not criticize one another, my friends. If you criticize or judge another Christian, you criticize and judge the Law. If you judge the Law, then you are no longer one who obeys the Law, but one who judges it. 
59Jms 4:12 God is the only lawgiver and judge. He alone can save and destroy. Who do you think you are, to judge someone else? 
59Jms 4:13 Now listen to me, you that say, "Today or tomorrow we will travel to a certain city, where we will stay a year and go into business and make a lot of money." 
59Jms 4:14 You don't even know what your life tomorrow will be! You are like a puff of smoke, which appears for a moment and then disappears. 
59Jms 4:15 What you should say is this£º "If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that." 
59Jms 4:16 But now you are proud, and you boast; all such boasting is wrong. 
59Jms 4:17 So then, if we do not do the good we know we should do, we are guilty of sin. 
59Jms 5:1 And now, you rich people, listen to me! Weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you! 
59Jms 5:2 Your riches have rotted away, and your clothes have been eaten by moths. 
59Jms 5:3 Your gold and silver are covered with rust, and this rust will be a witness against you and will eat up your flesh like fire. You have piled up riches in these last days. 
59Jms 5:4 You have not paid any wages to those who work in your fields. Listen to their complaints! The cries of those who gather in your crops have reached the ears of God, the Lord Almighty. 
59Jms 5:5 Your life here on earth has been full of luxury and pleasure. You have made yourselves fat for the day of slaughter. 
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and murdered innocent people, and they do not resist you. 
59Jms 5:7 Be patient, then, my friends, until the Lord comes. See how patient farmers are as they wait for their land to produce precious crops. They wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains. 
59Jms 5:8 You also must be patient. Keep your hopes high, for the day of the Lord's coming is near. 
59Jms 5:9 Do not complain against one another, my friends, so that God will not judge you. The Judge is near, ready to appear. 
59Jms 5:10 My friends, remember the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Take them as examples of patient endurance under suffering. 
59Jms 5:11 We call them happy because they endured. You have heard of Job's patience, and you know how the Lord provided for him in the end. For the Lord is full of mercy and compassion. 
59Jms 5:12 Above all, my friends, do not use an oath when you make a promise. Do not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Say only "Yes" when you mean yes, and "No" when you mean no, and then you will not come under God's judgment. 
59Jms 5:13 Are any among you in trouble? They should pray. Are any among you happy? They should sing praises. 
59Jms 5:14 Are any among you sick? They should send for the church elders, who will pray for them and rub olive oil on them in the name of the Lord. 
59Jms 5:15 This prayer made in faith will heal the sick; the Lord will restore them to health, and the sins they have committed will be forgiven. 
59Jms 5:16 So then, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you will be healed. The prayer of a good person has a powerful effect. 
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was the same kind of person as we are. He prayed earnestly that there would be no rain, and no rain fell on the land for three and a half years. 
59Jms 5:18 Once again he prayed, and the sky poured out its rain and the earth produced its crops. 
59Jms 5:19 My friends, if any of you wander away from the truth and another one brings you back again, 
59Jms 5:20 remember this£º whoever turns a sinner back from the wrong way will save that sinner's soul from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins.

601Pt 1:1 From Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ - To God's chosen people who live as refugees scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. 
601Pt 1:2 You were chosen according to the purpose of God the Father and were made a holy people by his Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be purified by his blood. May grace and peace be yours in full measure. 
601Pt 1:3 Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of his great mercy he gave us new life by raising Jesus Christ from death. This fills us with a living hope, 
601Pt 1:4 and so we look forward to possessing the rich blessings that God keeps for his people. He keeps them for you in heaven, where they cannot decay or spoil or fade away. 
601Pt 1:5 They are for you, who through faith are kept safe by God's power for the salvation which is ready to be revealed at the end of time. 
601Pt 1:6 Be glad about this, even though it may now be necessary for you to be sad for a while because of the many kinds of trials you suffer. 
601Pt 1:7 Their purpose is to prove that your faith is genuine. Even gold, which can be destroyed, is tested by fire; and so your faith, which is much more precious than gold, must also be tested, so that it may endure. Then you will receive praise and glory and honor on the Day when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
601Pt 1:8 You love him, although you have not seen him, and you believe in him, although you do not now see him. So you rejoice with a great and glorious joy which words cannot express, 
601Pt 1:9 because you are receiving the salvation of your souls, which is the purpose of your faith in him. 
601Pt 1:10 It was concerning this salvation that the prophets made careful search and investigation, and they prophesied about this gift which God would give you. 
601Pt 1:11 They tried to find out when the time would be and how it would come. This was the time to which Christ's Spirit in them was pointing, in predicting the sufferings that Christ would have to endure and the glory that would follow. 
601Pt 1:12 God revealed to these prophets that their work was not for their own benefit, but for yours, as they spoke about those things which you have now heard from the messengers who announced the Good News by the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things which even the angels would like to understand. 
601Pt 1:13 So then, have your minds ready for action. Keep alert and set your hope completely on the blessing which will be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed. 
601Pt 1:14 Be obedient to God, and do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had when you were still ignorant. 
601Pt 1:15 Instead, be holy in all that you do, just as God who called you is holy. 
601Pt 1:16 The scripture says, "Be holy because I am holy." 
601Pt 1:17 You call him Father, when you pray to God, who judges all people by the same standard, according to what each one has done; so then, spend the rest of your lives here on earth in reverence for him. 
601Pt 1:18 For you know what was paid to set you free from the worthless manner of life handed down by your ancestors. It was not something that can be destroyed, such as silver or gold; 
601Pt 1:19 it was the costly sacrifice of Christ, who was like a lamb without defect or flaw. 
601Pt 1:20 He had been chosen by God before the creation of the world and was revealed in these last days for your sake. 
601Pt 1:21 Through him you believe in God, who raised him from death and gave him glory; and so your faith and hope are fixed on God. 
601Pt 1:22 Now that by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves and have come to have a sincere love for other believers, love one another earnestly with all your heart. 
601Pt 1:23 For through the living and eternal word of God you have been born again as the children of a parent who is immortal, not mortal. 
601Pt 1:24 As the scripture says, "All human beings are like grass, and all their glory is like wild flowers. The grass withers, and the flowers fall, 
601Pt 1:25 but the word of the Lord remains forever." This word is the Good News that was proclaimed to you. 
601Pt 2:1 Rid yourselves, then, of all evil; no more lying or hypocrisy or jealousy or insulting language. 
601Pt 2:2 Be like newborn babies, always thirsty for the pure spiritual milk, so that by drinking it you may grow up and be saved. 
601Pt 2:3 As the scripture says, "You have found out for yourselves how kind the Lord is." 
601Pt 2:4 Come to the Lord, the living stone rejected by people as worthless but chosen by God as valuable. 
601Pt 2:5 Come as living stones, and let yourselves be used in building the spiritual temple, where you will serve as holy priests to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ. 
601Pt 2:6 For the scripture says, "I chose a valuable stone, which I am placing as the cornerstone in Zion; and whoever believes in him will never be disappointed." 
601Pt 2:7 This stone is of great value for you that believe; but for those who do not believe£º "The stone which the builders rejected as worthless turned out to be the most important of all." 
601Pt 2:8 And another scripture says, "This is the stone that will make people stumble, the rock that will make them fall." They stumbled because they did not believe in the word; such was God's will for them. 
601Pt 2:9 But you are the chosen race, the King's priests, the holy nation, God's own people, chosen to proclaim the wonderful acts of God, who called you out of darkness into his own marvelous light. 
601Pt 2:10 At one time you were not God's people, but now you are his people; at one time you did not know God's mercy, but now you have received his mercy. 
601Pt 2:11 I appeal to you, my friends, as strangers and refugees in this world! Do not give in to bodily passions, which are always at war against the soul. 
601Pt 2:12 Your conduct among the heathen should be so good that when they accuse you of being evildoers, they will have to recognize your good deeds and so praise God on the Day of his coming. 
601Pt 2:13 For the sake of the Lord submit yourselves to every human authority£º to the Emperor, who is the supreme authority, 
601Pt 2:14 and to the governors, who have been appointed by him to punish the evildoers and to praise those who do good. 
601Pt 2:15 For God wants you to silence the ignorant talk of foolish people by the good things you do. 
601Pt 2:16 Live as free people; do not, however, use your freedom to cover up any evil, but live as God's slaves. 
601Pt 2:17 Respect everyone, love other believers, honor God, and respect the Emperor. 
601Pt 2:18 You servants must submit yourselves to your masters and show them complete respect, not only to those who are kind and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. 
601Pt 2:19 God will bless you for this, if you endure the pain of undeserved suffering because you are conscious of his will. 
601Pt 2:20 For what credit is there if you endure the beatings you deserve for having done wrong? But if you endure suffering even when you have done right, God will bless you for it. 
601Pt 2:21 It was to this that God called you, for Christ himself suffered for you and left you an example, so that you would follow in his steps. 
601Pt 2:22 He committed no sin, and no one ever heard a lie come from his lips. 
601Pt 2:23 When he was insulted, he did not answer back with an insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but placed his hopes in God, the righteous Judge. 
601Pt 2:24 Christ himself carried our sins in his body to the cross, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness. It is by his wounds that you have been healed. 
601Pt 2:25 You were like sheep that had lost their way, but now you have been brought back to follow the Shepherd and Keeper of your souls. 
601Pt 3:1 In the same way you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands, so that if any of them do not believe God's word, your conduct will win them over to believe. It will not be necessary for you to say a word, 
601Pt 3:2 because they will see how pure and reverent your conduct is. 
601Pt 3:3 You should not use outward aids to make yourselves beautiful, such as the way you fix your hair, or the jewelry you put on, or the dresses you wear. 
601Pt 3:4 Instead, your beauty should consist of your true inner self, the ageless beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of the greatest value in God's sight. 
601Pt 3:5 For the devout women of the past who placed their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful by submitting themselves to their husbands. 
601Pt 3:6 Sarah was like that; she obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are now her daughters if you do good and are not afraid of anything. 
601Pt 3:7 In the same way you husbands must live with your wives with the proper understanding that they are more delicate than you. Treat them with respect, because they also will receive, together with you, God's gift of life. Do this so that nothing will interfere with your prayers. 
601Pt 3:8 To conclude£º you must all have the same attitude and the same feelings; love one another, and be kind and humble with one another. 
601Pt 3:9 Do not pay back evil with evil or cursing with cursing; instead, pay back with a blessing, because a blessing is what God promised to give you when he called you. 
601Pt 3:10 As the scripture says, "If you want to enjoy life and wish to see good times, you must keep from speaking evil and stop telling lies. 
601Pt 3:11 You must turn away from evil and do good; you must strive for peace with all your heart. 
601Pt 3:12 For the Lord watches over the righteous and listens to their prayers; but he opposes those who do evil." 
601Pt 3:13 Who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good? 
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, how happy you are! Do not be afraid of anyone, and do not worry. 
601Pt 3:15 But have reverence for Christ in your hearts, and honor him as Lord. Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you, 
601Pt 3:16 but do it with gentleness and respect. Keep your conscience clear, so that when you are insulted, those who speak evil of your good conduct as followers of Christ will become ashamed of what they say. 
601Pt 3:17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if this should be God's will, than for doing evil. 
601Pt 3:18 For Christ died for sins once and for all, a good man on behalf of sinners, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death physically, but made alive spiritually, 
601Pt 3:19 and in his spiritual existence he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits. 
601Pt 3:20 These were the spirits of those who had not obeyed God when he waited patiently during the days that Noah was building his boat. The few people in the boat - eight in all - were saved by the water, 
601Pt 3:21 which was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you. It is not the washing off of bodily dirt, but the promise made to God from a good conscience. It saves you through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
601Pt 3:22 who has gone to heaven and is at the right side of God, ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers. 
601Pt 4:1 Since Christ suffered physically, you too must strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking that he had; because whoever suffers physically is no longer involved with sin. 
601Pt 4:2 From now on, then, you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by God's will and not by human desires. 
601Pt 4:3 You have spent enough time in the past doing what the heathen like to do. Your lives were spent in indecency, lust, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and the disgusting worship of idols. 
601Pt 4:4 And now the heathen are surprised when you do not join them in the same wild and reckless living, and so they insult you. 
601Pt 4:5 But they will have to give an account of themselves to God, who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
601Pt 4:6 That is why the Good News was preached also to the dead, to those who had been judged in their physical existence as everyone is judged; it was preached to them so that in their spiritual existence they may live as God lives. 
601Pt 4:7 The end of all things is near. You must be self-controlled and alert, to be able to pray. 
601Pt 4:8 Above everything, love one another earnestly, because love covers over many sins. 
601Pt 4:9 Open your homes to each other without complaining. 
601Pt 4:10 Each one, as a good manager of God's different gifts, must use for the good of others the special gift he has received from God. 
601Pt 4:11 Those who preach must preach God's messages; those who serve must serve with the strength that God gives them, so that in all things praise may be given to God through Jesus Christ, to whom belong glory and power forever and ever. Amen. 
601Pt 4:12 My dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful test you are suffering, as though something unusual were happening to you. 
601Pt 4:13 Rather be glad that you are sharing Christ's sufferings, so that you may be full of joy when his glory is revealed. 
601Pt 4:14 Happy are you if you are insulted because you are Christ's followers; this means that the glorious Spirit, the Spirit of God, is resting on you. 
601Pt 4:15 If you suffer, it must not be because you are a murderer or a thief or a criminal or a meddler in other people's affairs. 
601Pt 4:16 However, if you suffer because you are a Christian, don't be ashamed of it, but thank God that you bear Christ's name. 
601Pt 4:17 The time has come for judgment to begin, and God's own people are the first to be judged. If it starts with us, how will it end with those who do not believe the Good News from God? 
601Pt 4:18 As the scripture says, "It is difficult for good people to be saved; what, then, will become of godless sinners?" 
601Pt 4:19 So then, those who suffer because it is God's will for them, should by their good actions trust themselves completely to their Creator, who always keeps his promise. 
601Pt 5:1 I, who am an elder myself, appeal to the church elders among you. I am a witness of Christ's sufferings, and I will share in the glory that will be revealed. I appeal to you 
601Pt 5:2 to be shepherds of the flock that God gave you and to take care of it willingly, as God wants you to, and not unwillingly. Do your work, not for mere pay, but from a real desire to serve. 
601Pt 5:3 Do not try to rule over those who have been put in your care, but be examples to the flock. 
601Pt 5:4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the glorious crown which will never lose its brightness. 
601Pt 5:5 In the same way you younger people must submit yourselves to your elders. And all of you must put on the apron of humility, to serve one another; for the scripture says, "God resists the proud, but shows favor to the humble." 
601Pt 5:6 Humble yourselves, then, under God's mighty hand, so that he will lift you up in his own good time. 
601Pt 5:7 Leave all your worries with him, because he cares for you. 
601Pt 5:8 Be alert, be on watch! Your enemy, the Devil, roams around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 
601Pt 5:9 Be firm in your faith and resist him, because you know that other believers in all the world are going through the same kind of sufferings. 
601Pt 5:10 But after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who calls you to share his eternal glory in union with Christ, will himself perfect you and give you firmness, strength, and a sure foundation. 
601Pt 5:11 To him be the power forever! Amen. 
601Pt 5:12 I write you this brief letter with the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful Christian. I want to encourage you and give my testimony that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. 
601Pt 5:13 Your sister church in Babylon, also chosen by God, sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark. 
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with the kiss of Christian love. May peace be with all of you who belong to Christ.

612Pt 1:1 From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ - To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been given a faith as precious as ours£º 
612Pt 1:2 May grace and peace be yours in full measure through your knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. 
612Pt 1:3 God's divine power has given us everything we need to live a truly religious life through our knowledge of the one who called us to share in his own glory and goodness. 
612Pt 1:4 In this way he has given us the very great and precious gifts he promised, so that by means of these gifts you may escape from the destructive lust that is in the world, and may come to share the divine nature. 
612Pt 1:5 For this very reason do your best to add goodness to your faith; to your goodness add knowledge; 
612Pt 1:6 to your knowledge add self-control; to your self-control add endurance; to your endurance add godliness; 
612Pt 1:7 to your godliness add Christian affection; and to your Christian affection add love. 
612Pt 1:8 These are the qualities you need, and if you have them in abundance, they will make you active and effective in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
612Pt 1:9 But if you do not have them, you are so shortsighted that you cannot see and have forgotten that you have been purified from your past sins. 
612Pt 1:10 So then, my friends, try even harder to make God's call and his choice of you a permanent experience; if you do so, you will never abandon your faith. 
612Pt 1:11 In this way you will be given the full right to enter the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
612Pt 1:12 And so I will always remind you of these matters, even though you already know them and are firmly grounded in the truth you have received. 
612Pt 1:13 I think it only right for me to stir up your memory of these matters as long as I am still alive. 
612Pt 1:14 I know that I shall soon put off this mortal body, as our Lord Jesus Christ plainly told me. 
612Pt 1:15 I will do my best, then, to provide a way for you to remember these matters at all times after my death. 
612Pt 1:16 We have not depended on made-up stories in making known to you the mighty coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. With our own eyes we saw his greatness. 
612Pt 1:17 We were there when he was given honor and glory by God the Father, when the voice came to him from the Supreme Glory, saying, "This is my own dear Son, with whom I am pleased!" 
612Pt 1:18 We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain. 
612Pt 1:19 So we are even more confident of the message proclaimed by the prophets. You will do well to pay attention to it, because it is like a lamp shining in a dark place until the Day dawns and the light of the morning star shines in your hearts. 
612Pt 1:20 Above all else, however, remember that none of us can explain by ourselves a prophecy in the Scriptures. 
612Pt 1:21 For no prophetic message ever came just from the human will, but people were under the control of the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God. 
612Pt 2:1 False prophets appeared in the past among the people, and in the same way false teachers will appear among you. They will bring in destructive, untrue doctrines, and will deny the Master who redeemed them, and so they will bring upon themselves sudden destruction. 
612Pt 2:2 Even so, many will follow their immoral ways; and because of what they do, others will speak evil of the Way of truth. 
612Pt 2:3 In their greed these false teachers will make a profit out of telling you made-up stories. For a long time now their Judge has been ready, and their Destroyer has been wide awake! 
612Pt 2:4 God did not spare the angels who sinned, but threw them into hell, where they are kept chained in darkness, waiting for the Day of Judgment. 
612Pt 2:5 God did not spare the ancient world, but brought the flood on the world of godless people; the only ones he saved were Noah, who preached righteousness, and seven other people. 
612Pt 2:6 God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, destroying them with fire, and made them an example of what will happen to the godless. 
612Pt 2:7 He rescued Lot, a good man, who was distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people. 
612Pt 2:8 That good man lived among them, and day after day he suffered agony as he saw and heard their evil actions. 
612Pt 2:9 And so the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the Day of Judgment, 
612Pt 2:10 especially those who follow their filthy bodily lusts and despise God's authority. These false teachers are bold and arrogant, and show no respect for the glorious beings above; instead, they insult them. 
612Pt 2:11 Even the angels, who are so much stronger and mightier than these false teachers, do not accuse them with insults in the presence of the Lord. 
612Pt 2:12 But these people act by instinct, like wild animals born to be captured and killed; they attack with insults anything they do not understand. They will be destroyed like wild animals, 
612Pt 2:13 and they will be paid with suffering for the suffering they have caused. Pleasure for them is to do anything in broad daylight that will satisfy their bodily appetites; they are a shame and a disgrace as they join you in your meals, all the while enjoying their deceitful ways! 
612Pt 2:14 They want to look for nothing but the chance to commit adultery; their appetite for sin is never satisfied. They lead weak people into a trap. Their hearts are trained to be greedy. They are under God's curse! 
612Pt 2:15 They have left the straight path and have lost their way; they have followed the path taken by Balaam son of Beor, who loved the money he would get for doing wrong 
612Pt 2:16 and was rebuked for his sin. His donkey spoke with a human voice and stopped the prophet's insane action. 
612Pt 2:17 These people are like dried-up springs, like clouds blown along by a storm; God has reserved a place for them in the deepest darkness. 
612Pt 2:18 They make proud and stupid statements, and use immoral bodily lusts to trap those who are just beginning to escape from among people who live in error. 
612Pt 2:19 They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of destructive habits - for we are slaves of anything that has conquered us. 
612Pt 2:20 If people have escaped from the corrupting forces of the world through their knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then are again caught and conquered by them, such people are in worse condition at the end than they were at the beginning. 
612Pt 2:21 It would have been much better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and then turn away from the sacred command that was given them. 
612Pt 2:22 What happened to them shows that the proverbs are true£º "A dog goes back to what it has vomited" and "A pig that has been washed goes back to roll in the mud." 
612Pt 3:1 My dear friends, this is now the second letter I have written you. In both letters I have tried to arouse pure thoughts in your minds by reminding you of these things. 
612Pt 3:2 I want you to remember the words that were spoken long ago by the holy prophets, and the command from the Lord and Savior which was given you by your apostles. 
612Pt 3:3 First of all, you must understand that in the last days some people will appear whose lives are controlled by their own lusts. They will make fun of you 
612Pt 3:4 and will ask, "He promised to come, didn't he? Where is he? Our ancestors have already died, but everything is still the same as it was since the creation of the world!" 
612Pt 3:5 They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command, and the heavens and earth were created. The earth was formed out of water and by water, 
612Pt 3:6 and it was also by water, the water of the flood, that the old world was destroyed. 
612Pt 3:7 But the heavens and the earth that now exist are being preserved by the same command of God, in order to be destroyed by fire. They are being kept for the day when godless people will be judged and destroyed. 
612Pt 3:8 But do not forget one thing, my dear friends! There is no difference in the Lord's sight between one day and a thousand years; to him the two are the same. 
612Pt 3:9 The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins. 
612Pt 3:10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that Day the heavens will disappear with a shrill noise, the heavenly bodies will burn up and be destroyed, and the earth with everything in it will vanish. 
612Pt 3:11 Since all these things will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? Your lives should be holy and dedicated to God, 
612Pt 3:12 as you wait for the Day of God and do your best to make it come soon - the Day when the heavens will burn up and be destroyed, and the heavenly bodies will be melted by the heat. 
612Pt 3:13 But we wait for what God has promised£º new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will be at home. 
612Pt 3:14 And so, my friends, as you wait for that Day, do your best to be pure and faultless in God's sight and to be at peace with him. 
612Pt 3:15 Look on our Lord's patience as the opportunity he is giving you to be saved, just as our dear friend Paul wrote to you, using the wisdom that God gave him. 
612Pt 3:16 This is what he says in all his letters when he writes on the subject. There are some difficult things in his letters which ignorant and unstable people explain falsely, as they do with other passages of the Scriptures. So they bring on their own destruction. 
612Pt 3:17 But you, my friends, already know this. Be on your guard, then, so that you will not be led away by the errors of lawless people and fall from your safe position. 
612Pt 3:18 But continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, now and forever! Amen.

621Jn 1:1 We write to you about the Word of life, which has existed from the very beginning. We have heard it, and we have seen it with our eyes; yes, we have seen it, and our hands have touched it. 
621Jn 1:2 When this life became visible, we saw it; so we speak of it and tell you about the eternal life which was with the Father and was made known to us. 
621Jn 1:3 What we have seen and heard we announce to you also, so that you will join with us in the fellowship that we have with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
621Jn 1:4 We write this in order that our joy may be complete. 
621Jn 1:5 Now the message that we have heard from his Son and announce is this£º God is light, and there is no darkness at all in him. 
621Jn 1:6 If, then, we say that we have fellowship with him, yet at the same time live in the darkness, we are lying both in our words and in our actions. 
621Jn 1:7 But if we live in the light - just as he is in the light - then we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from every sin. 
621Jn 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. 
621Jn 1:9 But if we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do what is right£º he will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing. 
621Jn 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make a liar out of God, and his word is not in us. 
621Jn 2:1 I am writing this to you, my children, so that you will not sin; but if anyone does sin, we have someone who pleads with the Father on our behalf - Jesus Christ, the righteous one. 
621Jn 2:2 And Christ himself is the means by which our sins are forgiven, and not our sins only, but also the sins of everyone. 
621Jn 2:3 If we obey God's commands, then we are sure that we know him. 
621Jn 2:4 If we say that we know him, but do not obey his commands, we are liars and there is no truth in us. 
621Jn 2:5 But if we obey his word, we are the ones whose love for God has really been made perfect. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God£º 
621Jn 2:6 if we say that we remain in union with God, we should live just as Jesus Christ did. 
621Jn 2:7 My dear friends, this command I am writing you is not new; it is the old command, the one you have had from the very beginning. The old command is the message you have already heard. 
621Jn 2:8 However, the command I now write you is new, because its truth is seen in Christ and also in you. For the darkness is passing away, and the real light is already shining. 
621Jn 2:9 If we say that we are in the light, yet hate others, we are in the darkness to this very hour. 
621Jn 2:10 If we love others, we live in the light, and so there is nothing in us that will cause someone else to sin. 
621Jn 2:11 But if we hate others, we are in the darkness; we walk in it and do not know where we are going, because the darkness has made us blind. 
621Jn 2:12 I write to you, my children, because your sins are forgiven for the sake of Christ. 
621Jn 2:13 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you have defeated the Evil One. 
621Jn 2:14 I write to you, my children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong; the word of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 
621Jn 2:15 Do not love the world or anything that belongs to the world. If you love the world, you do not love the Father. 
621Jn 2:16 Everything that belongs to the world - what the sinful self desires, what people see and want, and everything in this world that people are so proud of - none of this comes from the Father; it all comes from the world. 
621Jn 2:17 The world and everything in it that people desire is passing away; but those who do the will of God live forever. 
621Jn 2:18 My children, the end is near! You were told that the Enemy of Christ would come; and now many enemies of Christ have already appeared, and so we know that the end is near. 
621Jn 2:19 These people really did not belong to our fellowship, and that is why they left us; if they had belonged to our fellowship, they would have stayed with us. But they left so that it might be clear that none of them really belonged to us. 
621Jn 2:20 But you have had the Holy Spirit poured out on you by Christ, and so all of you know the truth. 
621Jn 2:21 I write you, then, not because you do not know the truth; instead, it is because you do know it, and you also know that no lie ever comes from the truth. 
621Jn 2:22 Who, then, is the liar? It is those who say that Jesus is not the Messiah. Such people are the Enemy of Christ - they reject both the Father and the Son. 
621Jn 2:23 For those who reject the Son reject also the Father; those who accept the Son have the Father also. 
621Jn 2:24 Be sure, then, to keep in your hearts the message you heard from the beginning. If you keep that message, then you will always live in union with the Son and the Father. 
621Jn 2:25 And this is what Christ himself promised to give us - eternal life. 
621Jn 2:26 I am writing this to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 
621Jn 2:27 But as for you, Christ has poured out his Spirit on you. As long as his Spirit remains in you, you do not need anyone to teach you. For his Spirit teaches you about everything, and what he teaches is true, not false. Obey the Spirit's teaching, then, and remain in union with Christ. 
621Jn 2:28 Yes, my children, remain in union with him, so that when he appears we may be full of courage and need not hide in shame from him on the Day he comes. 
621Jn 2:29 You know that Christ is righteous; you should know, then, that everyone who does what is right is God's child. 
621Jn 3:1 See how much the Father has loved us! His love is so great that we are called God's children - and so, in fact, we are. This is why the world does not know us£º it has not known God. 
621Jn 3:2 My dear friends, we are now God's children, but it is not yet clear what we shall become. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he really is. 
621Jn 3:3 Everyone who has this hope in Christ keeps himself pure, just as Christ is pure. 
621Jn 3:4 Whoever sins is guilty of breaking God's law, because sin is a breaking of the law. 
621Jn 3:5 You know that Christ appeared in order to take away sins, and that there is no sin in him. 
621Jn 3:6 So everyone who lives in union with Christ does not continue to sin; but whoever continues to sin has never seen him or known him. 
621Jn 3:7 Let no one deceive you, my children! Whoever does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. 
621Jn 3:8 Whoever continues to sin belongs to the Devil, because the Devil has sinned from the very beginning. The Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the Devil had done. 
621Jn 3:9 Those who are children of God do not continue to sin, for God's very nature is in them; and because God is their Father, they cannot continue to sin. 
621Jn 3:10 Here is the clear difference between God's children and the Devil's children£º those who do not do what is right or do not love others are not God's children. 
621Jn 3:11 The message you heard from the very beginning is this£º we must love one another. 
621Jn 3:12 We must not be like Cain; he belonged to the Evil One and murdered his own brother Abel. Why did Cain murder him? Because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right. 
621Jn 3:13 So do not be surprised, my friends, if the people of the world hate you. 
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have left death and come over into life; we know it because we love others. Those who do not love are still under the power of death. 
621Jn 3:15 Those who hate others are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life in them. 
621Jn 3:16 This is how we know what love is£º Christ gave his life for us. We too, then, ought to give our lives for others! 
621Jn 3:17 If we are rich and see others in need, yet close our hearts against them, how can we claim that we love God? 
621Jn 3:18 My children, our love should not be just words and talk; it must be true love, which shows itself in action. 
621Jn 3:19 This, then, is how we will know that we belong to the truth; this is how we will be confident in God's presence. 
621Jn 3:20 If our conscience condemns us, we know that God is greater than our conscience and that he knows everything. 
621Jn 3:21 And so, my dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, we have courage in God's presence. 
621Jn 3:22 We receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. 
621Jn 3:23 What he commands is that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as Christ commanded us. 
621Jn 3:24 Those who obey God's commands live in union with God and God lives in union with them. And because of the Spirit that God has given us we know that God lives in union with us. 
621Jn 4:1 My dear friends, do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 
621Jn 4:2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit£º anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 
621Jn 4:3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already. 
621Jn 4:4 But you belong to God, my children, and have defeated the false prophets, because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world. 
621Jn 4:5 Those false prophets speak about matters of the world, and the world listens to them because they belong to the world. 
621Jn 4:6 But we belong to God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This, then, is how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 
621Jn 4:7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Whoever loves is a child of God and knows God. 
621Jn 4:8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. 
621Jn 4:9 And God showed his love for us by sending his only Son into the world, so that we might have life through him. 
621Jn 4:10 This is what love is£º it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the means by which our sins are forgiven. 
621Jn 4:11 Dear friends, if this is how God loved us, then we should love one another. 
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in union with us, and his love is made perfect in us. 
621Jn 4:13 We are sure that we live in union with God and that he lives in union with us, because he has given us his Spirit. 
621Jn 4:14 And we have seen and tell others that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
621Jn 4:15 If we declare that Jesus is the Son of God, we live in union with God and God lives in union with us. 
621Jn 4:16 And we ourselves know and believe the love which God has for us. God is love, and those who live in love live in union with God and God lives in union with them. 
621Jn 4:17 Love is made perfect in us in order that we may have courage on the Judgment Day; and we will have it because our life in this world is the same as Christ's. 
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out all fear. So then, love has not been made perfect in anyone who is afraid, because fear has to do with punishment. 
621Jn 4:19 We love because God first loved us. 
621Jn 4:20 If we say we love God, but hate others, we are liars. For we cannot love God, whom we have not seen, if we do not love others, whom we have seen. 
621Jn 4:21 The command that Christ has given us is this£º whoever loves God must love others also. 
621Jn 5:1 Whoever believes that Jesus is the Messiah is a child of God; and whoever loves a father loves his child also. 
621Jn 5:2 This is how we know that we love God's children£º it is by loving God and obeying his commands. 
621Jn 5:3 For our love for God means that we obey his commands. And his commands are not too hard for us, 
621Jn 5:4 because every child of God is able to defeat the world. And we win the victory over the world by means of our faith. 
621Jn 5:5 Who can defeat the world? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 
621Jn 5:6 Jesus Christ is the one who came with the water of his baptism and the blood of his death. He came not only with the water, but with both the water and the blood. And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true, because the Spirit is truth. 
621Jn 5:7 There are three witnesses£º 
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and all three give the same testimony. 
621Jn 5:9 We believe human testimony; but God's testimony is much stronger, and he has given this testimony about his Son. 
621Jn 5:10 So those who believe in the Son of God have this testimony in their own heart; but those who do not believe God, have made a liar of him, because they have not believed what God has said about his Son. 
621Jn 5:11 The testimony is this£º God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son. 
621Jn 5:12 Whoever has the Son has this life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 
621Jn 5:13 I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have eternal life - you that believe in the Son of God. 
621Jn 5:14 We have courage in God's presence, because we are sure that he hears us if we ask him for anything that is according to his will. 
621Jn 5:15 He hears us whenever we ask him; and since we know this is true, we know also that he gives us what we ask from him. 
621Jn 5:16 If you see a believer commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray to God, who will give that person life. This applies to those whose sins do not lead to death. But there is sin which leads to death, and I do not say that you should pray to God about that. 
621Jn 5:17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which does not lead to death. 
621Jn 5:18 We know that no children of God keep on sinning, for the Son of God keeps them safe, and the Evil One cannot harm them. 
621Jn 5:19 We know that we belong to God even though the whole world is under the rule of the Evil One. 
621Jn 5:20 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we know the true God. We live in union with the true God - in union with his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and this is eternal life. 
621Jn 5:21 My children, keep yourselves safe from false gods! 
63
632Jn 1:1 From the Elder - To the dear Lady and to her children, whom I truly love. And I am not the only one, but all who know the truth love you, 
632Jn 1:2 because the truth remains in us and will be with us forever. 
632Jn 1:3 May God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, give us grace, mercy, and peace; may they be ours in truth and love. 
632Jn 1:4 How happy I was to find that some of your children live in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. 
632Jn 1:5 And so I ask you, dear Lady£º let us all love one another. This is no new command I am writing you; it is the command which we have had from the beginning. 
632Jn 1:6 This love I speak of means that we must live in obedience to God's commands. The command, as you have all heard from the beginning, is that you must all live in love. 
632Jn 1:7 Many deceivers have gone out over the world, people who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came as a human being. Such a person is a deceiver and the Enemy of Christ. 
632Jn 1:8 Be on your guard, then, so that you will not lose what we have worked for, but will receive your reward in full. 
632Jn 1:9 Anyone who does not stay with the teaching of Christ, but goes beyond it, does not have God. Whoever does stay with the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 
632Jn 1:10 So then, if some come to you who do not bring this teaching, do not welcome them in your homes; do not even say, "Peace be with you." 
632Jn 1:11 For anyone who wishes them peace becomes their partner in the evil things they do. 
632Jn 1:12 I have so much to tell you, but I would rather not do it with paper and ink; instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you personally, so that we shall be completely happy. 
632Jn 1:13 The children of your dear Sister send you their greetings. 
64
643Jn 1:1 From the Elder - To my dear Gaius, whom I truly love. 
643Jn 1:2 My dear friend, I pray that everything may go well with you and that you may be in good health - as I know you are well in spirit. 
643Jn 1:3 I was so happy when some Christians arrived and told me how faithful you are to the truth - just as you always live in the truth. 
643Jn 1:4 Nothing makes me happier than to hear that my children live in the truth. 
643Jn 1:5 My dear friend, you are so faithful in the work you do for other Christians, even when they are strangers. 
643Jn 1:6 They have spoken to the church here about your love. Please help them to continue their trip in a way that will please God. 
643Jn 1:7 For they set out on their trip in the service of Christ without accepting any help from unbelievers. 
643Jn 1:8 We Christians, then, must help these people, so that we may share in their work for the truth. 
643Jn 1:9 I wrote a short letter to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to be their leader, will not pay any attention to what I say. 
643Jn 1:10 When I come, then, I will bring up everything he has done£º the terrible things he says about us and the lies he tells! But that is not enough for him; he will not receive the Christians when they come, and even stops those who want to receive them and tries to drive them out of the church! 
643Jn 1:11 My dear friend, do not imitate what is bad, but imitate what is good. Whoever does good belongs to God; whoever does what is bad has not seen God. 
643Jn 1:12 Everyone speaks well of Demetrius; truth itself speaks well of him. And we add our testimony, and you know that what we say is true. 
643Jn 1:13 I have so much to tell you, but I do not want to do it with pen and ink. 
643Jn 1:14 I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk personally. 
643Jn 1:15 Peace be with you. All your friends send greetings. Greet all our friends personally.

65Jd 1:1 From Jude, servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James - To those who have been called by God, who live in the love of God the Father and the protection of Jesus Christ£º 
65Jd 1:2 May mercy, peace, and love be yours in full measure. 
65Jd 1:3 My dear friends, I was doing my best to write to you about the salvation we share in common, when I felt the need of writing at once to encourage you to fight on for the faith which once and for all God has given to his people. 
65Jd 1:4 For some godless people have slipped in unnoticed among us, persons who distort the message about the grace of our God in order to excuse their immoral ways, and who reject Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord. Long ago the Scriptures predicted the condemnation they have received. 
65Jd 1:5 For even though you know all this, I want to remind you of how the Lord once rescued the people of Israel from Egypt, but afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 
65Jd 1:6 Remember the angels who did not stay within the limits of their proper authority, but abandoned their own dwelling place£º they are bound with eternal chains in the darkness below, where God is keeping them for that great Day on which they will be condemned. 
65Jd 1:7 Remember Sodom and Gomorrah, and the nearby towns, whose people acted as those angels did and indulged in sexual immorality and perversion£º they suffer the punishment of eternal fire as a plain warning to all. 
65Jd 1:8 In the same way also, these people have visions which make them sin against their own bodies; they despise God's authority and insult the glorious beings above. 
65Jd 1:9 Not even the chief angel Michael did this. In his quarrel with the Devil, when they argued about who would have the body of Moses, Michael did not dare condemn the Devil with insulting words, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!" 
65Jd 1:10 But these people attack with insults anything they do not understand; and those things that they know by instinct, like wild animals, are the very things that destroy them. 
65Jd 1:11 How terrible for them! They have followed the way that Cain took. For the sake of money they have given themselves over to the error that Balaam committed. They have rebelled as Korah rebelled, and like him they are destroyed. 
65Jd 1:12 With their shameless carousing they are like dirty spots in your fellowship meals. They take care only of themselves. They are like clouds carried along by the wind, but bringing no rain. They are like trees that bear no fruit, even in autumn, trees that have been pulled up by the roots and are completely dead. 
65Jd 1:13 They are like wild waves of the sea, with their shameful deeds showing up like foam. They are like wandering stars, for whom God has reserved a place forever in the deepest darkness. 
65Jd 1:14 It was Enoch, the seventh direct descendant from Adam, who long ago prophesied this about them£º "The Lord will come with many thousands of his holy angels 
65Jd 1:15 to bring judgment on all, to condemn them all for the godless deeds they have performed and for all the terrible words that godless sinners have spoken against him!" 
65Jd 1:16 These people are always grumbling and blaming others; they follow their own evil desires; they brag about themselves and flatter others in order to get their own way. 
65Jd 1:17 But remember, my friends, what you were told in the past by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
65Jd 1:18 They said to you, "When the last days come, people will appear who will make fun of you, people who follow their own godless desires." 
65Jd 1:19 These are the people who cause divisions, who are controlled by their natural desires, who do not have the Spirit. 
65Jd 1:20 But you, my friends, keep on building yourselves up on your most sacred faith. Pray in the power of the Holy Spirit, 
65Jd 1:21 and keep yourselves in the love of God, as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy to give you eternal life. 
65Jd 1:22 Show mercy toward those who have doubts; 
65Jd 1:23 save others by snatching them out of the fire; and to others show mercy mixed with fear, but hate their very clothes, stained by their sinful lusts. 
65Jd 1:24 To him who is able to keep you from falling and to bring you faultless and joyful before his glorious presence - 
65Jd 1:25 to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority, from all ages past, and now, and forever and ever! Amen.

66Rv 1:1 This book is the record of the events that Jesus Christ revealed. God gave him this revelation in order to show to his servants what must happen very soon. Christ made these things known to his servant John by sending his angel to him, 
66Rv 1:2 and John has told all that he has seen. This is his report concerning the message from God and the truth revealed by Jesus Christ. 
66Rv 1:3 Happy is the one who reads this book, and happy are those who listen to the words of this prophetic message and obey what is written in this book! For the time is near when all these things will happen. 
66Rv 1:4 From John to the seven churches in the province of Asia£º Grace and peace be yours from God, who is, who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits in front of his throne, 
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first to be raised from death and who is also the ruler of the kings of the world. He loves us, and by his sacrificial death he has freed us from our sins 
66Rv 1:6 and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God and Father. To Jesus Christ be the glory and power forever and ever! Amen. 
66Rv 1:7 Look, he is coming on the clouds! Everyone will see him, including those who pierced him. All peoples on earth will mourn over him. So shall it be! 
66Rv 1:8 "I am the first and the last," says the Lord God Almighty, who is, who was, and who is to come. 
66Rv 1:9 I am John, your brother, and as a follower of Jesus I am your partner in patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom. I was put on the island of Patmos because I had proclaimed God's word and the truth that Jesus revealed. 
66Rv 1:10 On the Lord's day the Spirit took control of me, and I heard a loud voice, that sounded like a trumpet, speaking behind me. 
66Rv 1:11 It said, "Write down what you see, and send the book to the churches in these seven cities£º Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." 
66Rv 1:12 I turned around to see who was talking to me, and I saw seven gold lampstands, 
66Rv 1:13 and among them there was what looked like a human being, wearing a robe that reached to his feet, and a gold band around his chest. 
66Rv 1:14 His hair was white as wool, or as snow, and his eyes blazed like fire; 
66Rv 1:15 his feet shone like brass that has been refined and polished, and his voice sounded like a roaring waterfall. 
66Rv 1:16 He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. His face was as bright as the midday sun. 
66Rv 1:17 When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand on me and said, "Don't be afraid! I am the first and the last. 
66Rv 1:18 I am the living one! I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever. I have authority over death and the world of the dead. 
66Rv 1:19 Write, then, the things you see, both the things that are now and the things that will happen afterward. 
66Rv 1:20 Here is the secret meaning of the seven stars that you see in my right hand, and of the seven gold lampstands£º the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. 
66Rv 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write£º "This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands. 
66Rv 2:2 I know what you have done; I know how hard you have worked and how patient you have been. I know that you cannot tolerate evil people and that you have tested those who say they are apostles but are not, and have found out that they are liars. 
66Rv 2:3 You are patient, you have suffered for my sake, and you have not given up. 
66Rv 2:4 But this is what I have against you£º you do not love me now as you did at first. 
66Rv 2:5 Think how far you have fallen! Turn from your sins and do what you did at first. If you don't turn from your sins, I will come to you and take your lampstand from its place. 
66Rv 2:6 But this is what you have in your favor£º you hate what the Nicolaitans do, as much as I do. 
66Rv 2:7 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! "To those who win the victory I will give the right to eat the fruit of the tree of life that grows in the Garden of God. 
66Rv 2:8 "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write£º "This is the message from the one who is the first and the last, who died and lived again. 
66Rv 2:9 I know your troubles; I know that you are poor - but really you are rich! I know the evil things said against you by those who claim to be Jews but are not; they are a group that belongs to Satan! 
66Rv 2:10 Don't be afraid of anything you are about to suffer. Listen! The Devil will put you to the test by having some of you thrown into prison, and your troubles will last ten days. Be faithful to me, even if it means death, and I will give you life as your prize of victory. 
66Rv 2:11 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! "Those who win the victory will not be hurt by the second death. 
66Rv 2:12 "To the angel of the church in Pergamum write£º "This is the message from the one who has the sharp two-edged sword. 
66Rv 2:13 I know where you live, there where Satan has his throne. You are true to me, and you did not abandon your faith in me even during the time when Antipas, my faithful witness, was killed there where Satan lives. 
66Rv 2:14 But there are a few things I have against you£º there are some among you who follow the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak how to lead the people of Israel into sin by persuading them to eat food that had been offered to idols and to practice sexual immorality. 
66Rv 2:15 In the same way you have people among you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 
66Rv 2:16 Now turn from your sins! If you don't, I will come to you soon and fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth. 
66Rv 2:17 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! "To those who win the victory I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it. 
66Rv 2:18 "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write£º "This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes blaze like fire, whose feet shine like polished brass. 
66Rv 2:19 I know what you do. I know your love, your faithfulness, your service, and your patience. I know that you are doing more now than you did at first. 
66Rv 2:20 But this is what I have against you£º you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a messenger of God. By her teaching she misleads my servants into practicing sexual immorality and eating food that has been offered to idols. 
66Rv 2:21 I have given her time to repent of her sins, but she does not want to turn from her immorality. 
66Rv 2:22 And so I will throw her on a bed where she and those who committed adultery with her will suffer terribly. I will do this now unless they repent of the wicked things they did with her. 
66Rv 2:23 I will also kill her followers, and then all the churches will know that I am the one who knows everyone's thoughts and wishes. I will repay each of you according to what you have done. 
66Rv 2:24 "But the rest of you in Thyatira have not followed this evil teaching; you have not learned what the others call 'the deep secrets of Satan.' I say to you that I will not put any other burden on you. 
66Rv 2:25 But until I come, you must hold firmly to what you have. 
66Rv 2:26 To those who win the victory, who continue to the end to do what I want, I will give the same authority that I received from my Father£º
66Rv 2:27 I will give them authority over the nations, to rule them with an iron rod and to break them to pieces like clay pots. 
66Rv 2:28 I will also give them the morning star. 
66Rv 2:29 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! 
66Rv 3:1 "To the angel of the church in Sardis write£º "This is the message from the one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know what you are doing; I know that you have the reputation of being alive, even though you are dead! 
66Rv 3:2 So wake up, and strengthen what you still have before it dies completely. For I find that what you have done is not yet perfect in the sight of my God. 
66Rv 3:3 Remember, then, what you were taught and what you heard; obey it and turn from your sins. If you do not wake up, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not even know the time when I will come. 
66Rv 3:4 But a few of you there in Sardis have kept your clothes clean. You will walk with me, clothed in white, because you are worthy to do so. 
66Rv 3:5 Those who win the victory will be clothed like this in white, and I will not remove their names from the book of the living. In the presence of my Father and of his angels I will declare openly that they belong to me. 
66Rv 3:6 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! 
66Rv 3:7 "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write£º "This is the message from the one who is holy and true. He has the key that belonged to David, and when he opens a door, no one can close it, and when he closes it, no one can open it. 
66Rv 3:8 I know what you do; I know that you have a little power; you have followed my teaching and have been faithful to me. I have opened a door in front of you, which no one can close. 
66Rv 3:9 Listen! As for that group that belongs to Satan, those liars who claim that they are Jews but are not, I will make them come and bow down at your feet. They will all know that I love you. 
66Rv 3:10 Because you have kept my command to endure, I will also keep you safe from the time of trouble which is coming upon the world to test all the people on earth. 
66Rv 3:11 I am coming soon. Keep safe what you have, so that no one will rob you of your victory prize. 
66Rv 3:12 I will make those who are victorious pillars in the temple of my God, and they will never leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from my God. I will also write on them my new name. 
66Rv 3:13 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches! 
66Rv 3:14 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write£º "This is the message from the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the origin of all that God has created. 
66Rv 3:15 I know what you have done; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. How I wish you were either one or the other! 
66Rv 3:16 But because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am going to spit you out of my mouth! 
66Rv 3:17 You say, 'I am rich and well off; I have all I need.' But you do not know how miserable and pitiful you are! You are poor, naked, and blind. 
66Rv 3:18 I advise you, then, to buy gold from me, pure gold, in order to be rich. Buy also white clothing to dress yourself and cover up your shameful nakedness. Buy also some ointment to put on your eyes, so that you may see. 
66Rv 3:19 I rebuke and punish all whom I love. Be in earnest, then, and turn from your sins. 
66Rv 3:20 Listen! I stand at the door and knock; if any hear my voice and open the door, I will come into their house and eat with them, and they will eat with me. 
66Rv 3:21 To those who win the victory I will give the right to sit beside me on my throne, just as I have been victorious and now sit by my Father on his throne. 
66Rv 3:22 "If you have ears, then, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches!" 
66Rv 4:1 At this point I had another vision and saw an open door in heaven. And the voice that sounded like a trumpet, which I had heard speaking to me before, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this." 
66Rv 4:2 At once the Spirit took control of me. There in heaven was a throne with someone sitting on it. 
66Rv 4:3 His face gleamed like such precious stones as jasper and carnelian, and all around the throne there was a rainbow the color of an emerald. 
66Rv 4:4 In a circle around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, on which were seated twenty-four elders dressed in white and wearing crowns of gold. 
66Rv 4:5 From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. In front of the throne seven lighted torches were burning, which are the seven spirits of God. 
66Rv 4:6 Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. Surrounding the throne on each of its sides, were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and behind. 
66Rv 4:7 The first one looked like a lion; the second looked like a bull; the third had a face like a human face; and the fourth looked like an eagle in flight. 
66Rv 4:8 Each one of the four living creatures had six wings, and they were covered with eyes, inside and out. Day and night they never stop singing£º "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was, who is, and who is to come." 
66Rv 4:9 The four living creatures sing songs of glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever. When they do so, 
66Rv 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever. They throw their crowns down in front of the throne and say, 
66Rv 4:11 "Our Lord and God! You are worthy to receive glory, honor, and power. For you created all things, and by your will they were given existence and life." 
66Rv 5:1 I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne; it was covered with writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals. 
66Rv 5:2 And I saw a mighty angel, who announced in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?" 
66Rv 5:3 But there was no one in heaven or on earth or in the world below who could open the scroll and look inside it. 
66Rv 5:4 I cried bitterly because no one could be found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside it. 
66Rv 5:5 Then one of the elders said to me, "Don't cry. Look! The Lion from Judah's tribe, the great descendant of David, has won the victory, and he can break the seven seals and open the scroll." 
66Rv 5:6 Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne, surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb appeared to have been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that have been sent through the whole earth. 
66Rv 5:7 The Lamb went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne. 
66Rv 5:8 As he did so, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each had a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God's people. 
66Rv 5:9 They sang a new song£º "You are worthy to take the scroll and to break open its seals. For you were killed, and by your sacrificial death you bought for God people from every tribe, language, nation, and race. 
66Rv 5:10 You have made them a kingdom of priests to serve our God, and they shall rule on earth." 
66Rv 5:11 Again I looked, and I heard angels, thousands and millions of them! They stood around the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders, 
66Rv 5:12 and sang in a loud voice£º "The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power, wealth, wisdom, and strength, honor, glory, and praise!" 
66Rv 5:13 And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, in the world below, and in the sea - all living beings in the universe - and they were singing£º "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, be praise and honor, glory and might, forever and ever!" 
66Rv 5:14 The four living creatures answered, "Amen!" And the elders fell down and worshiped. 
66Rv 6:1 Then I saw the Lamb break open the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder, "Come!" 
66Rv 6:2 I looked, and there was a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown. He rode out as a conqueror to conquer. 
66Rv 6:3 Then the Lamb broke open the second seal; and I heard the second living creature say, "Come!" 
66Rv 6:4 Another horse came out, a red one. Its rider was given the power to bring war on the earth, so that people should kill each other. He was given a large sword. 
66Rv 6:5 Then the Lamb broke open the third seal; and I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there was a black horse. Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. 
66Rv 6:6 I heard what sounded like a voice coming from among the four living creatures, which said, "A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and three quarts of barley for a day's wages. But do not damage the olive trees and the vineyards!" 
66Rv 6:7 Then the Lamb broke open the fourth seal; and I heard the fourth living creature say, "Come!" 
66Rv 6:8 I looked, and there was a pale-colored horse. Its rider was named Death, and Hades followed close behind. They were given authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill by means of war, famine, disease, and wild animals. 
66Rv 6:9 Then the Lamb broke open the fifth seal. I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they had proclaimed God's word and had been faithful in their witnessing. 
66Rv 6:10 They shouted in a loud voice, "Almighty Lord, holy and true! How long will it be until you judge the people on earth and punish them for killing us?" 
66Rv 6:11 Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the complete number of other servants and believers were killed, as they had been. 
66Rv 6:12 And I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal. There was a violent earthquake, and the sun became black like coarse black cloth, and the moon turned completely red like blood. 
66Rv 6:13 The stars fell down to the earth, like unripe figs falling from the tree when a strong wind shakes it. 
66Rv 6:14 The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. 
66Rv 6:15 Then the kings of the earth, the rulers and the military chiefs, the rich and the powerful, and all other people, slave and free, hid themselves in caves and under rocks on the mountains. 
66Rv 6:16 They called out to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the eyes of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb! 
66Rv 6:17 The terrible day of their anger is here, and who can stand up against it?" 
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so that no wind should blow on the earth or the sea or against any tree. 
66Rv 7:2 And I saw another angel coming up from the east with the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given the power to damage the earth and the sea. 
66Rv 7:3 The angel said, "Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees, until we mark the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads." 
66Rv 7:4 And I was told that the number of those who were marked with God's seal on their foreheads was 144,000. They were from the twelve tribes of Israel, 
66Rv 7:5 twelve thousand from each tribe£º Judah, Reuben, 
66Rv 7:6 Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, 
66Rv 7:7 Simeon, Levi, Issachar, 
66Rv 7:8 Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
66Rv 7:9 After this I looked, and there was an enormous crowd - no one could count all the people! They were from every race, tribe, nation, and language, and they stood in front of the throne and of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palm branches in their hands. 
66Rv 7:10 They called out in a loud voice£º "Salvation comes from our God, who sits on the throne, and from the Lamb!" 
66Rv 7:11 All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures. Then they threw themselves face downward in front of the throne and worshiped God, 
66Rv 7:12 saying, "Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen!" 
66Rv 7:13 One of the elders asked me, "Who are these people dressed in white robes, and where do they come from?" 
66Rv 7:14 "I don't know, sir. You do," I answered. He said to me, "These are the people who have come safely through the terrible persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb. 
66Rv 7:15 That is why they stand before God's throne and serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will protect them with his presence. 
66Rv 7:16 Never again will they hunger or thirst; neither sun nor any scorching heat will burn them, 
66Rv 7:17 because the Lamb, who is in the center of the throne, will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of life-giving water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." 
66Rv 8:1 When the Lamb broke open the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
66Rv 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets. 
66Rv 8:3 Another angel, who had a gold incense container, came and stood at the altar. He was given a lot of incense to add to the prayers of all God's people and to offer it on the gold altar that stands before the throne. 
66Rv 8:4 The smoke of the burning incense went up with the prayers of God's people from the hands of the angel standing before God. 
66Rv 8:5 Then the angel took the incense container, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. There were rumblings and peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. 
66Rv 8:6 Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. 
66Rv 8:7 The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire, mixed with blood, came pouring down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees, and every blade of green grass. 
66Rv 8:8 Then the second angel blew his trumpet. Something that looked like a huge mountain on fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea was turned into blood, 
66Rv 8:9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
66Rv 8:10 Then the third angel blew his trumpet. A large star, burning like a torch, dropped from the sky and fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 
66Rv 8:11 (The name of the star is "Bitterness.") A third of the water turned bitter, and many people died from drinking the water, because it had turned bitter. 
66Rv 8:12 Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that their light lost a third of its brightness; there was no light during a third of the day and a third of the night also. 
66Rv 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air say in a loud voice, "O horror! horror! How horrible it will be for all who live on earth when the sound comes from the trumpets that the other three angels must blow!" 
66Rv 9:1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star which had fallen down to the earth, and it was given the key to the abyss. 
66Rv 9:2 The star opened the abyss, and smoke poured out of it, like the smoke from a large furnace; the sunlight and the air were darkened by the smoke from the abyss. 
66Rv 9:3 Locusts came down out of the smoke upon the earth, and they were given the same kind of power that scorpions have. 
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass or the trees or any other plant; they could harm only the people who did not have the mark of God's seal on their foreheads. 
66Rv 9:5 The locusts were not allowed to kill these people, but only to torture them for five months. The pain caused by the torture is like the pain caused by a scorpion's sting. 
66Rv 9:6 During those five months they will seek death, but will not find it; they will want to die, but death will flee from them. 
66Rv 9:7 The locusts looked like horses ready for battle; on their heads they had what seemed to be crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces. 
66Rv 9:8 Their hair was like women's hair, their teeth were like lions' teeth. 
66Rv 9:9 Their chests were covered with what looked like iron breastplates, and the sound made by their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle. 
66Rv 9:10 They have tails and stings like those of a scorpion, and it is with their tails that they have the power to hurt people for five months. 
66Rv 9:11 They have a king ruling over them, who is the angel in charge of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; in Greek the name is Apollyon (meaning "The Destroyer"). 
66Rv 9:12 The first horror is over; after this there are still two more horrors to come. 
66Rv 9:13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice coming from the four corners of the gold altar standing before God. 
66Rv 9:14 The voice said to the sixth angel, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River!" 
66Rv 9:15 The four angels were released; for this very hour of this very day of this very month and year they had been kept ready to kill a third of all the human race. 
66Rv 9:16 I was told the number of the mounted troops£º it was two hundred million. 
66Rv 9:17 And in my vision I saw the horses and their riders£º they had breastplates red as fire, blue as sapphire, and yellow as sulfur. The horses' heads were like lions' heads, and from their mouths came out fire, smoke, and sulfur. 
66Rv 9:18 A third of the human race was killed by those three plagues£º the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur coming out of the horses' mouths. 
66Rv 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and also in their tails. Their tails are like snakes with heads, and they use them to hurt people. 
66Rv 9:20 The rest of the human race, all those who had not been killed by these plagues, did not turn away from what they themselves had made. They did not stop worshiping demons, nor the idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk. 
66Rv 9:21 Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic, their sexual immorality, or their stealing. 
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven. He was wrapped in a cloud and had a rainbow around his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire. 
66Rv 10:2 He had a small scroll open in his hand. He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, 
66Rv 10:3 and called out in a loud voice that sounded like the roar of lions. After he had called out, the seven thunders answered with a roar. 
66Rv 10:4 As soon as they spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice speak from heaven, "Keep secret what the seven thunders have said; do not write it down!" 
66Rv 10:5 Then the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven 
66Rv 10:6 and took a vow in the name of God, who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, earth, and the sea, and everything in them. The angel said, "There will be no more delay! 
66Rv 10:7 But when the seventh angel blows his trumpet, then God will accomplish his secret plan, as he announced to his servants, the prophets." 
66Rv 10:8 Then the voice that I had heard speaking from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go and take the open scroll which is in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land." 
66Rv 10:9 I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, "Take it and eat it; it will turn sour in your stomach, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey." 
66Rv 10:10 I took the little scroll from his hand and ate it, and it tasted sweet as honey in my mouth. But after I swallowed it, it turned sour in my stomach. 
66Rv 10:11 Then I was told, "Once again you must proclaim God's message about many nations, races, languages, and kings." 
66Rv 11:1 I was then given a stick that looked like a measuring-rod, and was told, "Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who are worshiping in the temple. 
66Rv 11:2 But do not measure the outer courts, because they have been given to the heathen, who will trample on the Holy City for forty-two months. 
66Rv 11:3 I will send my two witnesses dressed in sackcloth, and they will proclaim God's message during those 1, 260 days." 
66Rv 11:4 The two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth. 
66Rv 11:5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and destroys their enemies; and in this way whoever tries to harm them will be killed. 
66Rv 11:6 They have authority to shut up the sky so that there will be no rain during the time they proclaim God's message. They have authority also over the springs of water, to turn them into blood; they have authority also to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish. 
66Rv 11:7 When they finish proclaiming their message, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will fight against them. He will defeat them and kill them, 
66Rv 11:8 and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, where their Lord was crucified. The symbolic name of that city is Sodom, or Egypt. 
66Rv 11:9 People from all nations, tribes, languages, and races will look at their bodies for three and a half days and will not allow them to be buried. 
66Rv 11:10 The people of the earth will be happy because of the death of these two. They will celebrate and send presents to each other, because those two prophets brought much suffering upon the whole human race. 
66Rv 11:11 After three and a half days a life-giving breath came from God and entered them, and they stood up; and all who saw them were terrified. 
66Rv 11:12 Then the two prophets heard a loud voice say to them from heaven, "Come up here!" As their enemies watched, they went up into heaven in a cloud. 
66Rv 11:13 At that very moment there was a violent earthquake; a tenth of the city was destroyed, and seven thousand people were killed. The rest of the people were terrified and praised the greatness of the God of heaven. 
66Rv 11:14 The second horror is over, but the third horror will come soon! 
66Rv 11:15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The power to rule over the world belongs now to our Lord and his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever!" 
66Rv 11:16 Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones in front of God threw themselves face downward and worshiped God, 
66Rv 11:17 saying£º "Lord God Almighty, the one who is and who was! We thank you that you have taken your great power and have begun to rule! 
66Rv 11:18 The heathen were filled with rage, because the time for your anger has come, the time for the dead to be judged. The time has come to reward your servants, the prophets, and all your people, all who have reverence for you, great and small alike. The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth!" 
66Rv 11:19 God's temple in heaven was opened, and the Covenant Box was seen there. Then there were flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. 
66Rv 12:1 Then a great and mysterious sight appeared in the sky. There was a woman, whose dress was the sun and who had the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 
66Rv 12:2 She was soon to give birth, and the pains and suffering of childbirth made her cry out. 
66Rv 12:3 Another mysterious sight appeared in the sky. There was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and a crown on each of his heads. 
66Rv 12:4 With his tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth. He stood in front of the woman, in order to eat her child as soon as it was born. 
66Rv 12:5 Then she gave birth to a son, who will rule over all nations with an iron rod. But the child was snatched away and taken to God and his throne. 
66Rv 12:6 The woman fled to the desert, to a place God had prepared for her, where she will be taken care of for 1, 260 days. 
66Rv 12:7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, who fought back with his angels; 
66Rv 12:8 but the dragon was defeated, and he and his angels were not allowed to stay in heaven any longer. 
66Rv 12:9 The huge dragon was thrown out - that ancient serpent, named the Devil, or Satan, that deceived the whole world. He was thrown down to earth, and all his angels with him. 
66Rv 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, "Now God's salvation has come! Now God has shown his power as King! Now his Messiah has shown his authority! For the one who stood before our God and accused believers day and night has been thrown out of heaven. 
66Rv 12:11 They won the victory over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the truth which they proclaimed; and they were willing to give up their lives and die. 
66Rv 12:12 And so be glad, you heavens, and all you that live there! But how terrible for the earth and the sea! For the Devil has come down to you, and he is filled with rage, because he knows that he has only a little time left." 
66Rv 12:13 When the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth, he began to pursue the woman who had given birth to the boy. 
66Rv 12:14 She was given the two wings of a large eagle in order to fly to her place in the desert, where she will be taken care of for three and a half years, safe from the dragon's attack. 
66Rv 12:15 And then from his mouth the dragon poured out a flood of water after the woman, so that it would carry her away. 
66Rv 12:16 But the earth helped the woman; it opened its mouth and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon's mouth. 
66Rv 12:17 The dragon was furious with the woman and went off to fight against the rest of her descendants, all those who obey God's commandments and are faithful to the truth revealed by Jesus. 
66Rv 13:1 \{\\cf2 (12:18) (And the dragon stood on the seashore.\{\\cf2 ) Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads; on each of its horns there was a crown, and on each of its heads there was a name that was insulting to God.
66Rv 13:2 The beast looked like a leopard, with feet like a bear's feet and a mouth like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave the beast his own power, his throne, and his vast authority. 
66Rv 13:3 One of the heads of the beast seemed to have been fatally wounded, but the wound had healed. The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast. 
66Rv 13:4 Everyone worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast. They worshiped the beast also, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who can fight against it?" 
66Rv 13:5 The beast was allowed to make proud claims which were insulting to God, and it was permitted to have authority for forty-two months. 
66Rv 13:6 It began to curse God, his name, the place where he lives, and all those who live in heaven. 
66Rv 13:7 It was allowed to fight against God's people and to defeat them, and it was given authority over every tribe, nation, language, and race. 
66Rv 13:8 All people living on earth will worship it, except those whose names were written before the creation of the world in the book of the living which belongs to the Lamb that was killed. 
66Rv 13:9 "Listen, then, if you have ears! 
66Rv 13:10 Whoever is meant to be captured will surely be captured; whoever is meant to be killed by the sword will surely be killed by the sword. This calls for endurance and faith on the part of God's people." 
66Rv 13:11 Then I saw another beast, which came up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb's horns, and it spoke like a dragon. 
66Rv 13:12 It used the vast authority of the first beast in its presence. It forced the earth and all who live on it to worship the first beast, whose wound had healed. 
66Rv 13:13 This second beast performed great miracles; it made fire come down out of heaven to earth in the sight of everyone. 
66Rv 13:14 And it deceived all the people living on earth by means of the miracles which it was allowed to perform in the presence of the first beast. The beast told them to build an image in honor of the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
66Rv 13:15 The second beast was allowed to breathe life into the image of the first beast, so that the image could talk and put to death all those who would not worship it. 
66Rv 13:16 The beast forced all the people, small and great, rich and poor, slave and free, to have a mark placed on their right hands or on their foreheads. 
66Rv 13:17 No one could buy or sell without this mark, that is, the beast's name or the number that stands for the name. 
66Rv 13:18 This calls for wisdom. Whoever is intelligent can figure out the meaning of the number of the beast, because the number stands for the name of someone. Its number is 666. 
66Rv 14:1 Then I looked, and there was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion; with him were 144,000 people who have his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 
66Rv 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven that sounded like a roaring waterfall, like a loud peal of thunder. It sounded like the music made by musicians playing their harps. 
66Rv 14:3 The 144,000 people stood before the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders; they were singing a new song, which only they could learn. Of the whole human race they are the only ones who have been redeemed. 
66Rv 14:4 They are the men who have kept themselves pure by not having sexual relations with women; they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from the rest of the human race and are the first ones to be offered to God and to the Lamb. 
66Rv 14:5 They have never been known to tell lies; they are faultless. 
66Rv 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying high in the air, with an eternal message of Good News to announce to the peoples of the earth, to every race, tribe, language, and nation. 
66Rv 14:7 He said in a loud voice, "Honor God and praise his greatness! For the time has come for him to judge all people. Worship him who made heaven, earth, sea, and the springs of water!" 
66Rv 14:8 A second angel followed the first one, saying, "She has fallen! Great Babylon has fallen! She made all peoples drink her wine - the strong wine of her immoral lust!" 
66Rv 14:9 A third angel followed the first two, saying in a loud voice, "Those who worship the beast and its image and receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand 
66Rv 14:10 will themselves drink God's wine, the wine of his fury, which he has poured at full strength into the cup of his anger! All who do this will be tormented in fire and sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb. 
66Rv 14:11 The smoke of the fire that torments them goes up forever and ever. There is no relief day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, for anyone who has the mark of its name." 
66Rv 14:12 This calls for endurance on the part of God's people, those who obey God's commandments and are faithful to Jesus. 
66Rv 14:13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this£º Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!" "Yes indeed!" answers the Spirit. "They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them." 
66Rv 14:14 Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was what looked like a human being, with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 
66Rv 14:15 Then another angel came out from the temple and cried out in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud, "Use your sickle and reap the harvest, because the time has come; the earth is ripe for the harvest!" 
66Rv 14:16 Then the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth's harvest was reaped. 
66Rv 14:17 Then I saw another angel come out of the temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
66Rv 14:18 Then another angel, who is in charge of the fire, came from the altar. He shouted in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, "Use your sickle, and cut the grapes from the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes are ripe!" 
66Rv 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle on the earth, cut the grapes from the vine, and threw them into the wine press of God's furious anger. 
66Rv 14:20 The grapes were squeezed out in the wine press outside the city, and blood came out of the wine press in a flood two hundred miles long and about five feet deep. 
66Rv 15:1 Then I saw in the sky another mysterious sight, great and amazing. There were seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last ones, because they are the final expression of God's anger. 
66Rv 15:2 Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. I also saw those who had won the victory over the beast and its image and over the one whose name is represented by a number. They were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps that God had given them 
66Rv 15:3 and singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb£º "Lord God Almighty, how great and wonderful are your deeds! King of the nations, how right and true are your ways! 
66Rv 15:4 Who will not stand in awe of you, Lord? Who will refuse to declare your greatness? You alone are holy. All the nations will come and worship you, because your just actions are seen by all." 
66Rv 15:5 After this I saw the temple in heaven open, with the Sacred Tent in it. 
66Rv 15:6 The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, dressed in clean shining linen and with gold bands tied around their chests. 
66Rv 15:7 Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever. 
66Rv 15:8 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God, and no one could go into the temple until the seven plagues brought by the seven angels had come to an end. 
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice speaking from the temple to the seven angels£º "Go and pour out the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth!" 
66Rv 16:2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth. Terrible and painful sores appeared on those who had the mark of the beast and on those who had worshiped its image. 
66Rv 16:3 Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea. The water became like the blood of a dead person, and every living creature in the sea died. 
66Rv 16:4 Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood. 
66Rv 16:5 I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, "The judgments you have made are just, O Holy One, you who are and who were! 
66Rv 16:6 They poured out the blood of God's people and of the prophets, and so you have given them blood to drink. They are getting what they deserve!" 
66Rv 16:7 Then I heard a voice from the altar saying, "Lord God Almighty! True and just indeed are your judgments!" 
66Rv 16:8 Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to burn people with its fiery heat. 
66Rv 16:9 They were burned by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God, who has authority over these plagues. But they would not turn from their sins and praise his greatness. 
66Rv 16:10 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast. Darkness fell over the beast's kingdom, and people bit their tongues because of their pain, 
66Rv 16:11 and they cursed the God of heaven for their pains and sores. But they did not turn from their evil ways. 
66Rv 16:12 Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River. The river dried up, to provide a way for the kings who come from the east. 
66Rv 16:13 Then I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs. They were coming out of the mouth of the dragon, the mouth of the beast, and the mouth of the false prophet. 
66Rv 16:14 They are the spirits of demons that perform miracles. These three spirits go out to all the kings of the world, to bring them together for the battle on the great Day of Almighty God. 
66Rv 16:15 "Listen! I am coming like a thief ! Happy is he who stays awake and guards his clothes, so that he will not walk around naked and be ashamed in public!" 
66Rv 16:16 Then the spirits brought the kings together in the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. 
66Rv 16:17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl in the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple, saying, "It is done!" 
66Rv 16:18 There were flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder, and a terrible earthquake. There has never been such an earthquake since the creation of human beings; this was the worst earthquake of all! 
66Rv 16:19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of all countries were destroyed. God remembered great Babylon and made her drink the wine from his cup - the wine of his furious anger. 
66Rv 16:20 All the islands disappeared, all the mountains vanished. 
66Rv 16:21 Huge hailstones, each weighing as much as a hundred pounds, fell from the sky on people, who cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because it was such a terrible plague. 
66Rv 17:1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came to me and said, "Come, and I will show you how the famous prostitute is to be punished, that great city that is built near many rivers. 
66Rv 17:2 The kings of the earth practiced sexual immorality with her, and the people of the world became drunk from drinking the wine of her immorality." 
66Rv 17:3 The Spirit took control of me, and the angel carried me to a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names insulting to God written all over it; the beast had seven heads and ten horns. 
66Rv 17:4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and covered with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup full of obscene and filthy things, the result of her immorality. 
66Rv 17:5 On her forehead was written a name that has a secret meaning£º "Great Babylon, the mother of all prostitutes and perverts in the world." 
66Rv 17:6 And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's people and the blood of those who were killed because they had been loyal to Jesus. When I saw her, I was completely amazed. 
66Rv 17:7 "Why are you amazed?" the angel asked me. "I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and of the beast that carries her, the beast with seven heads and ten horns. 
66Rv 17:8 That beast was once alive, but lives no longer; it is about to come up from the abyss and will go off to be destroyed. The people living on earth whose names have not been written before the creation of the world in the book of the living, will all be amazed as they look at the beast. It was once alive; now it no longer lives, but it will reappear. 
66Rv 17:9 "This calls for wisdom and understanding. The seven heads are seven hills, on which the woman sits. They are also seven kings£º 
66Rv 17:10 five of them have fallen, one still rules, and the other one has not yet come; when he comes, he must rule only a little while. 
66Rv 17:11 And the beast that was once alive, but lives no longer, is itself an eighth king who is one of the seven and is going off to be destroyed. 
66Rv 17:12 "The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule, but who will be given authority to rule as kings for one hour with the beast. 
66Rv 17:13 These ten all have the same purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. 
66Rv 17:14 They will fight against the Lamb; but the Lamb, together with his called, chosen, and faithful followers, will defeat them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings." 
66Rv 17:15 The angel also said to me, "The waters you saw, on which the prostitute sits, are nations, peoples, races, and languages. 
66Rv 17:16 The ten horns you saw and the beast will hate the prostitute; they will take away everything she has and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and destroy her with fire. 
66Rv 17:17 For God has placed in their hearts the will to carry out his purpose by acting together and giving to the beast their power to rule until God's words come true. 
66Rv 17:18 "The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth." 
66Rv 18:1 After this I saw another angel coming down out of heaven. He had great authority, and his splendor brightened the whole earth. 
66Rv 18:2 He cried out in a loud voice£º "She has fallen! Great Babylon has fallen! She is now haunted by demons and unclean spirits; all kinds of filthy and hateful birds live in her. 
66Rv 18:3 For all the nations have drunk her wine - the strong wine of her immoral lust. The kings of the earth practiced sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the world grew rich from her unrestrained lust." 
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out, my people! Come out from her! You must not take part in her sins; you must not share in her punishment! 
66Rv 18:5 For her sins are piled up as high as heaven, and God remembers her wicked ways. 
66Rv 18:6 Treat her exactly as she has treated you; pay her back double for all she has done. Fill her cup with a drink twice as strong as the drink she prepared for you. 
66Rv 18:7 Give her as much suffering and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. For she keeps telling herself£º 'Here I sit, a queen! I am no widow, I will never know grief !' 
66Rv 18:8 Because of this, in one day she will be struck with plagues - disease, grief, and famine. And she will be burned with fire, because the Lord God, who judges her, is mighty." 
66Rv 18:9 The kings of the earth who took part in her immorality and lust will cry and weep over the city when they see the smoke from the flames that consume her. 
66Rv 18:10 They stand a long way off, because they are afraid of sharing in her suffering. They say, "How terrible! How awful! This great and mighty city Babylon! In just one hour you have been punished!" 
66Rv 18:11 The merchants of the earth also cry and mourn for her, because no one buys their goods any longer; 
66Rv 18:12 no one buys their gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; their goods of linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; all kinds of rare woods and all kinds of objects made of ivory and of expensive wood, of bronze, iron, and marble; 
66Rv 18:13 and cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine and oil, flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and carriages, slaves, and even human lives. 
66Rv 18:14 The merchants say to her, "All the good things you longed to own have disappeared, and all your wealth and glamor are gone, and you will never find them again!" 
66Rv 18:15 The merchants, who became rich from doing business in that city, will stand a long way off, because they are afraid of sharing in her suffering. They will cry and mourn, 
66Rv 18:16 and say, "How terrible! How awful for the great city! She used to dress herself in linen, purple, and scarlet, and cover herself with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls! 
66Rv 18:17 And in one hour she has lost all this wealth!" All the ships' captains and passengers, the sailors and all others who earn their living on the sea, stood a long way off, 
66Rv 18:18 and cried out as they saw the smoke from the flames that consumed her£º "There never has been another city like this great city!" 
66Rv 18:19 They threw dust on their heads, they cried and mourned, saying, "How terrible! How awful for the great city! She is the city where all who have ships sailing the seas became rich on her wealth! And in one hour she has lost everything!" 
66Rv 18:20 Be glad, heaven, because of her destruction! Be glad, God's people and the apostles and prophets! For God has condemned her for what she did to you! 
66Rv 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "This is how the great city Babylon will be violently thrown down and will never be seen again. 
66Rv 18:22 The music of harps and of human voices, of players of the flute and the trumpet, will never be heard in you again! No workman in any trade will ever be found in you again; and the sound of the millstone will be heard no more! 
66Rv 18:23 Never again will the light of a lamp be seen in you; no more will the voices of brides and grooms be heard in you. Your merchants were the most powerful in all the world, and with your false magic you deceived all the peoples of the world!" 
66Rv 18:24 Babylon was punished because the blood of prophets and of God's people was found in the city; yes, the blood of all those who have been killed on earth. 
66Rv 19:1 After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a large crowd of people in heaven, saying, "Praise God! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God! 
66Rv 19:2 True and just are his judgments! He has condemned the prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her immorality. God has punished her because she killed his servants." 
66Rv 19:3 Again they shouted, "Praise God! The smoke from the flames that consume the great city goes up forever and ever!" 
66Rv 19:4 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. They said, "Amen! Praise God!" 
66Rv 19:5 Then there came from the throne the sound of a voice, saying, "Praise our God, all his servants and all people, both great and small, who have reverence for him!" 
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard what sounded like a crowd, like the sound of a roaring waterfall, like loud peals of thunder. I heard them say, "Praise God! For the Lord, our Almighty God, is King! 
66Rv 19:7 Let us rejoice and be glad; let us praise his greatness! For the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb, and his bride has prepared herself for it. 
66Rv 19:8 She has been given clean shining linen to wear." (The linen is the good deeds of God's people.) 
66Rv 19:9 Then the angel said to me, "Write this£º Happy are those who have been invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb." And the angel added, "These are the true words of God." 
66Rv 19:10 I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "Don't do it! I am a servant together with you and with other believers, all those who hold to the truth that Jesus revealed. Worship God!" For the truth that Jesus revealed is what inspires the prophets. 
66Rv 19:11 Then I saw heaven open, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True; it is with justice that he judges and fights his battles. 
66Rv 19:12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and he wore many crowns on his head. He had a name written on him, but no one except himself knows what it is. 
66Rv 19:13 The robe he wore was covered with blood. His name is "The Word of God." 
66Rv 19:14 The armies of heaven followed him, riding on white horses and dressed in clean white linen. 
66Rv 19:15 Out of his mouth came a sharp sword, with which he will defeat the nations. He will rule over them with a rod of iron, and he will trample out the wine in the wine press of the furious anger of the Almighty God. 
66Rv 19:16 On his robe and on his thigh was written the name£º "King of kings and Lord of lords." 
66Rv 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He shouted in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair£º "Come and gather together for God's great feast! 
66Rv 19:18 Come and eat the flesh of kings, generals, and soldiers, the flesh of horses and their riders, the flesh of all people, slave and free, great and small!" 
66Rv 19:19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to fight against the one who was riding the horse and against his army. 
66Rv 19:20 The beast was taken prisoner, together with the false prophet who had performed miracles in his presence. (It was by those miracles that he had deceived those who had the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped the image of the beast.) The beast and the false prophet were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
66Rv 19:21 Their armies were killed by the sword that comes out of the mouth of the one who was riding the horse; and all the birds ate all they could of their flesh. 
66Rv 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a heavy chain. 
66Rv 20:2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent - that is, the Devil, or Satan - and chained him up for a thousand years. 
66Rv 20:3 The angel threw him into the abyss, locked it, and sealed it, so that he could not deceive the nations any more until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set loose for a little while. 
66Rv 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the power to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been executed because they had proclaimed the truth that Jesus revealed and the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image, nor had they received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and ruled as kings with Christ for a thousand years. 
66Rv 20:5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.) This is the first raising of the dead. 
66Rv 20:6 Happy and greatly blessed are those who are included in this first raising of the dead. The second death has no power over them; they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they will rule with him for a thousand years. 
66Rv 20:7 After the thousand years are over, Satan will be set loose from his prison, 
66Rv 20:8 and he will go out to deceive the nations scattered over the whole world, that is, Gog and Magog. Satan will bring them all together for battle, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. 
66Rv 20:9 They spread out over the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people and the city that he loves. But fire came down from heaven and destroyed them. 
66Rv 20:10 Then the Devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. 
66Rv 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and the one who sits on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence and were seen no more. 
66Rv 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small alike, standing before the throne. Books were opened, and then another book was opened, the book of the living. The dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books. 
66Rv 20:13 Then the sea gave up its dead. Death and the world of the dead also gave up the dead they held. And all were judged according to what they had done. 
66Rv 20:14 Then death and the world of the dead were thrown into the lake of fire. (This lake of fire is the second death.) 
66Rv 20:15 Those who did not have their name written in the book of the living were thrown into the lake of fire. 
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth disappeared, and the sea vanished. 
66Rv 21:2 And I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared and ready, like a bride dressed to meet her husband. 
66Rv 21:3 I heard a loud voice speaking from the throne£º "Now God's home is with people! He will live with them, and they shall be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God. 
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe away all tears from their eyes. There will be no more death, no more grief or crying or pain. The old things have disappeared." 
66Rv 21:5 Then the one who sits on the throne said, "And now I make all things new!" He also said to me, "Write this, because these words are true and can be trusted." 
66Rv 21:6 And he said, "It is done! I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end. To anyone who is thirsty I will give the right to drink from the spring of the water of life without paying for it. 
66Rv 21:7 Those who win the victory will receive this from me£º I will be their God, and they will be my children. 
66Rv 21:8 But cowards, traitors, perverts, murderers, the immoral, those who practice magic, those who worship idols, and all liars - the place for them is the lake burning with fire and sulfur, which is the second death." 
66Rv 21:9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, "Come, and I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb." 
66Rv 21:10 The Spirit took control of me, and the angel carried me to the top of a very high mountain. He showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, coming down out of heaven from God 
66Rv 21:11 and shining with the glory of God. The city shone like a precious stone, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
66Rv 21:12 It had a great, high wall with twelve gates and with twelve angels in charge of the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the people of Israel. 
66Rv 21:13 There were three gates on each side£º three on the east, three on the south, three on the north, and three on the west. 
66Rv 21:14 The city's wall was built on twelve foundation stones, on which were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
66Rv 21:15 The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 
66Rv 21:16 The city was perfectly square, as wide as it was long. The angel measured the city with his measuring stick£º it was fifteen hundred miles long and was as wide and as high as it was long. 
66Rv 21:17 The angel also measured the wall, and it was 216 feet high, according to the standard unit of measure which he was using. 
66Rv 21:18 The wall was made of jasper, and the city itself was made of pure gold, as clear as glass. 
66Rv 21:19 The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation stone was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
66Rv 21:20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh yellow quartz, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chalcedony, the eleventh turquoise, the twelfth amethyst. 
66Rv 21:21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate was made from a single pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass. 
66Rv 21:22 I did not see a temple in the city, because its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb. 
66Rv 21:23 The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God shines on it, and the Lamb is its lamp. 
66Rv 21:24 The peoples of the world will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their wealth into it. 
66Rv 21:25 The gates of the city will stand open all day; they will never be closed, because there will be no night there. 
66Rv 21:26 The greatness and the wealth of the nations will be brought into the city. 
66Rv 21:27 But nothing that is impure will enter the city, nor anyone who does shameful things or tells lies. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of the living will enter the city. 
66Rv 22:1 The angel also showed me the river of the water of life, sparkling like crystal, and coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
66Rv 22:2 and flowing down the middle of the city's street. On each side of the river was the tree of life, which bears fruit twelve times a year, once each month; and its leaves are for the healing of the nations. 
66Rv 22:3 Nothing that is under God's curse will be found in the city. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will worship him. 
66Rv 22:4 They will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. 
66Rv 22:5 There shall be no more night, and they will not need lamps or sunlight, because the Lord God will be their light, and they will rule as kings forever and ever. 
66Rv 22:6 Then the angel said to me, "These words are true and can be trusted. And the Lord God, who gives his Spirit to the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen very soon." 
66Rv 22:7 "Listen!" says Jesus. "I am coming soon! Happy are those who obey the prophetic words in this book!" 
66Rv 22:8 I, John, have heard and seen all these things. And when I finished hearing and seeing them, I fell down at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things, and I was about to worship him. 
66Rv 22:9 But he said to me, "Don't do it! I am a servant together with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all those who obey the words in this book. Worship God!" 
66Rv 22:10 And he said to me, "Do not keep the prophetic words of this book a secret, because the time is near when all this will happen. 
66Rv 22:11 Whoever is evil must go on doing evil, and whoever is filthy must go on being filthy; whoever is good must go on doing good, and whoever is holy must go on being holy." 
66Rv 22:12 "Listen!" says Jesus. "I am coming soon! I will bring my rewards with me, to give to each one according to what he has done. 
66Rv 22:13 I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end." 
66Rv 22:14 Happy are those who wash their robes clean and so have the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life and to go through the gates into the city. 
66Rv 22:15 But outside the city are the perverts and those who practice magic, the immoral and the murderers, those who worship idols and those who are liars both in words and deeds. 
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to announce these things to you in the churches. I am descended from the family of David; I am the bright morning star." 
66Rv 22:17 The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come!" Everyone who hears this must also say, "Come!" Come, whoever is thirsty; accept the water of life as a gift, whoever wants it. 
66Rv 22:18 I, John, solemnly warn everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book£º if any add anything to them, God will add to their punishment the plagues described in this book. 
66Rv 22:19 And if any take anything away from the prophetic words of this book, God will take away from them their share of the fruit of the tree of life and of the Holy City, which are described in this book. 
66Rv 22:20 He who gives his testimony to all this says, "Yes indeed! I am coming soon!" So be it. Come, Lord Jesus! 
66Rv 22:21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with everyone.
