111Kg 1:1 King David was now a very old man, and although his servants covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
111Kg 1:2 So his officials said to him, "Your Majesty, let us find a young woman to stay with you and take care of you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm." 
111Kg 1:3 A search was made all over Israel for a beautiful young woman, and in Shunem they found such a woman named Abishag, and brought her to the king. 
111Kg 1:4 She was very beautiful, and waited on the king and took care of him, but he did not have intercourse with her. 
111Kg 1:5 Now that Absalom was dead, Adonijah, the son of David and Haggith, was the oldest surviving son. He was a very handsome man. 
111Kg 1:6 David had never reprimanded him about anything, and he was ambitious to be king. He provided for himself chariots, horses, and an escort of fifty men.
111Kg 1:7 He talked with Joab (whose mother was Zeruiah) and with Abiathar the priest, and they agreed to support his cause. 
111Kg 1:8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's bodyguards were not on Adonijah's side. 
111Kg 1:9 One day Adonijah offered a sacrifice of sheep, bulls, and fattened calves at Snake Rock, near the spring of Enrogel. He invited the other sons of King David and the king's officials who were from Judah to come to this sacrificial feast, 
111Kg 1:10 but he did not invite his half brother Solomon or Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king's bodyguards. 
111Kg 1:11 Then Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and asked her, "Haven't you heard that Haggith's son Adonijah has made himself king? And King David doesn't know anything about it! 
111Kg 1:12 If you want to save your life and the life of your son Solomon, I would advise you to 
111Kg 1:13 go at once to King David and ask him, 'Your Majesty, didn't you solemnly promise me that my son Solomon would succeed you as king? How is it, then, that Adonijah has become king?' " 
111Kg 1:14 And Nathan added, "Then, while you are still talking with King David, I will come in and confirm your story." 
111Kg 1:15 So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. He was very old, and Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, was taking care of him. 
111Kg 1:16 Bathsheba bowed low before the king, and he asked, "What do you want?" 
111Kg 1:17 She answered, "Your Majesty, you made me a solemn promise in the name of the LORD your God that my son Solomon would be king after you. 
111Kg 1:18 But Adonijah has already become king, and you don't know anything about it. 
111Kg 1:19 He has offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves, and he invited your sons, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of your army to the feast, but he did not invite your son Solomon. 
111Kg 1:20 Your Majesty, all the people of Israel are looking to you to tell them who is to succeed you as king. 
111Kg 1:21 If you don't, as soon as you are dead, my son Solomon and I will be treated as traitors." 
111Kg 1:22 She was still speaking, when Nathan arrived at the palace. 
111Kg 1:23 The king was told that the prophet was there, and Nathan went in and bowed low before the king. 
111Kg 1:24 Then he said, "Your Majesty, have you announced that Adonijah would succeed you as king? 
111Kg 1:25 This very day he has gone and offered a sacrifice of many bulls, sheep, and fattened calves. He invited all your sons, Joab the commander of your army, and Abiathar the priest, and right now they are feasting with him and shouting, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 
111Kg 1:26 But he did not invite me, sir, or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or Solomon. 
111Kg 1:27 Did Your Majesty approve all this and not even tell your officials who is to succeed you as king?" 
111Kg 1:28 King David said, "Ask Bathsheba to come back in" - and she came and stood before him. 
111Kg 1:29 Then he said to her, "I promise you by the living LORD, who has rescued me from all my troubles, 
111Kg 1:30 that today I will keep the promise I made to you in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, that your son Solomon would succeed me as king." 
111Kg 1:31 Bathsheba bowed low and said, "May my lord the king live forever!" 
111Kg 1:32 Then King David sent for Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah. When they came in, 
111Kg 1:33 he said to them, "Take my court officials with you; have my son Solomon ride my own mule, and escort him down to Gihon Spring, 
111Kg 1:34 where Zadok and Nathan are to anoint him as king of Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!' 
111Kg 1:35 Follow him back here when he comes to sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, because he is the one I have chosen to be the ruler of Israel and Judah." 
111Kg 1:36 "It shall be done," answered Benaiah, "and may the LORD your God confirm it! 
111Kg 1:37 As the LORD has been with Your Majesty, may he also be with Solomon and make his reign even more prosperous than yours." 
111Kg 1:38 So Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon Spring. 
111Kg 1:39 Zadok took the container of olive oil which he had brought from the Tent of the LORD's presence, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!" 
111Kg 1:40 Then they all followed him back, shouting for joy and playing flutes, making enough noise to shake the ground. 
111Kg 1:41 As Adonijah and all his guests were finishing the feast, they heard the noise. And when Joab heard the trumpet, he asked, "What's the meaning of all that noise in the city?" 
111Kg 1:42 Before he finished speaking, Jonathan, the son of the priest Abiathar, arrived. "Come on in," Adonijah said. "You're a good man - you must be bringing good news." 
111Kg 1:43 "I'm afraid not," Jonathan answered. "His Majesty King David has made Solomon king. 
111Kg 1:44 He sent Zadok, Nathan, Benaiah, and the royal bodyguards to escort him. They had him ride on the king's mule, 
111Kg 1:45 and Zadok and Nathan anointed him as king at Gihon Spring. Then they went into the city, shouting for joy, and the people are now in an uproar. That's the noise you just heard. 
111Kg 1:46 Solomon is now the king. 
111Kg 1:47 What is more, the court officials went in to pay their respects to His Majesty King David and said, 'May your God make Solomon even more famous than you, and may Solomon's reign be even more prosperous than yours.' Then King David bowed in worship on his bed 
111Kg 1:48 and prayed, 'Let us praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has today made one of my descendants succeed me as king, and has let me live to see it!' " 
111Kg 1:49 Then Adonijah's guests were afraid, and they all got up and left, each going his own way. 
111Kg 1:50 Adonijah, in great fear of Solomon, went to the Tent of the LORD's presence and took hold of the corners of the altar. 
111Kg 1:51 King Solomon was told that Adonijah was afraid of him and that he was holding on to the corners of the altar and had said, "First, I want King Solomon to swear to me that he will not have me put to death." 
111Kg 1:52 Solomon replied, "If he is loyal, not even a hair on his head will be touched; but if he is not, he will die." 
111Kg 1:53 King Solomon then sent for Adonijah and had him brought down from the altar. Adonijah went to the king and bowed low before him, and the king said to him, "You may go home." 
111Kg 2:1 When David was about to die, he called his son Solomon and gave him his last instructions��
111Kg 2:2 "My time to die has come. Be confident and determined, 
111Kg 2:3 and do what the LORD your God orders you to do. Obey all his laws and commands, as written in the Law of Moses, so that wherever you go you may prosper in everything you do. 
111Kg 2:4 If you obey him, the LORD will keep the promise he made when he told me that my descendants would rule Israel as long as they were careful to obey his commands faithfully with all their heart and soul. 
111Kg 2:5 "There is something else. You remember what Joab did to me by killing the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. You remember how he murdered them in time of peace as revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war. He killed innocent men, and now I bear the responsibility for what he did, and I suffer the consequences. 
111Kg 2:6 You know what to do; you must not let him die a natural death. 
111Kg 2:7 "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead and take care of them, because they were kind to me when I was fleeing from your brother Absalom. 
111Kg 2:8 "There is also Shimei son of Gera, from the town of Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me bitterly the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he met me at the Jordan River, I gave him my solemn promise in the name of the LORD that I would not have him killed. 
111Kg 2:9 But you must not let him go unpunished. You know what to do, and you must see to it that he is put to death." 
111Kg 2:10 David died and was buried in David's City. 
111Kg 2:11 He had been king of Israel for forty years, ruling seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
111Kg 2:12 Solomon succeeded his father David as king, and his royal power was firmly established. 
111Kg 2:13 Then Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, went to Bathsheba, who was Solomon's mother. "Is this a friendly visit?" she asked. "It is," he answered, 
111Kg 2:14 and then he added, "I have something to ask of you." "What is it?" she asked. 
111Kg 2:15 He answered, "You know that I should have become king and that everyone in Israel expected it. But it happened differently, and my brother became king because it was the LORD's will. 
111Kg 2:16 And now I have one request to make; please do not refuse me." "What is it?" Bathsheba asked. 
111Kg 2:17 He answered, "Please ask King Solomon - I know he won't refuse you - to let me have Abishag, the young woman from Shunem, as my wife." 
111Kg 2:18 "Very well," she answered. "I will speak to the king for you." 
111Kg 2:19 So Bathsheba went to the king to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king stood up to greet his mother and bowed to her. Then he sat on his throne and had another one brought in on which she sat at his right. 
111Kg 2:20 She said, "I have a small favor to ask of you; please do not refuse me." "What is it, mother?" he asked. "I will not refuse you." 
111Kg 2:21 She answered, "Let your brother Adonijah have Abishag as his wife." 
111Kg 2:22 "Why do you ask me to give Abishag to him?" the king asked. "You might as well ask me to give him the throne too. After all, he is my older brother, and Abiathar the priest and Joab are on his side!" 
111Kg 2:23 Then Solomon made a solemn promise in the LORD's name, "May God strike me dead if I don't make Adonijah pay with his life for asking this! 
111Kg 2:24 The LORD has firmly established me on the throne of my father David; he has kept his promise and given the kingdom to me and my descendants. I swear by the living LORD that Adonijah will die this very day!" 
111Kg 2:25 So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Adonijah. 
111Kg 2:26 Then King Solomon said to Abiathar the priest, "Go to your country home in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not have you put to death now, for you were in charge of the LORD's Covenant Box while you were with my father David, and you shared in all his troubles." 
111Kg 2:27 Then Solomon dismissed Abiathar from serving as a priest of the LORD, and so made come true what the LORD had said in Shiloh about the priest Eli and his descendants. 
111Kg 2:28 Joab heard what had happened. (He had supported Adonijah, but not Absalom.) So he fled to the Tent of the LORD's presence and took hold of the corners of the altar. 
111Kg 2:29 When the news reached King Solomon that Joab had fled to the Tent and was by the altar, Solomon sent a messenger to Joab to ask him why he had fled to the altar. Joab answered that he had fled to the LORD because he was afraid of Solomon. So King Solomon sent Benaiah to kill Joab. 
111Kg 2:30 He went to the Tent of the LORD's presence and said to Joab, "The king orders you to come out." "No," Joab answered. "I will die here." Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said. 
111Kg 2:31 "Do what Joab says," Solomon answered. "Kill him and bury him. Then neither I nor any other of David's descendants will any longer be held responsible for what Joab did when he killed innocent men. 
111Kg 2:32 The LORD will punish Joab for those murders, which he committed without my father David's knowledge. Joab killed two innocent men who were better men than he�� Abner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, commander of the army of Judah. 
111Kg 2:33 The punishment for their murders will fall on Joab and on his descendants forever. But the LORD will always give success to David's descendants who sit on his throne." 
111Kg 2:34 So Benaiah went to the Tent of the LORD's presence and killed Joab, and he was buried at his home in the open country. 
111Kg 2:35 The king made Benaiah commander of the army in Joab's place and put Zadok the priest in Abiathar's place. 
111Kg 2:36 Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build a house for yourself here in Jerusalem. Live in it and don't leave the city. 
111Kg 2:37 If you ever leave and go beyond Kidron Brook, you will certainly die - and you yourself will be to blame." 
111Kg 2:38 "Very well, Your Majesty," Shimei answered. "I will do what you say." So he lived in Jerusalem a long time. 
111Kg 2:39 Three years later, however, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to the king of Gath, Achish son of Maacah. When Shimei heard that they were in Gath, 
111Kg 2:40 he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish in Gath, to find his slaves. He found them and brought them back home. 
111Kg 2:41 When Solomon heard what Shimei had done, 
111Kg 2:42 he sent for him and said, "I made you promise in the LORD's name not to leave Jerusalem. And I warned you that if you ever did, you would certainly die. Did you not agree to it and say that you would obey me? 
111Kg 2:43 Why, then, have you broken your promise and disobeyed my command? 
111Kg 2:44 You know very well all the wrong that you did to my father David. The LORD will punish you for it. 
111Kg 2:45 But he will bless me, and he will make David's kingdom secure forever." 
111Kg 2:46 Then the king gave orders to Benaiah, who went out and killed Shimei. Solomon was now in complete control. 
111Kg 3:1 Solomon made an alliance with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. He brought her to live in David's City until he had finished building his palace, the Temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. 
111Kg 3:2 A temple had not yet been built for the LORD, and so the people were still offering sacrifices at many different altars. 
111Kg 3:3 Solomon loved the LORD and followed the instructions of his father David, but he also slaughtered animals and offered them as sacrifices on various altars. 
111Kg 3:4 On one occasion he went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices because that was where the most famous altar was. He had offered hundreds of burnt offerings there in the past. 
111Kg 3:5 That night the LORD appeared to him in a dream and asked him, "What would you like me to give you?" 
111Kg 3:6 Solomon answered, "You always showed great love for my father David, your servant, and he was good, loyal, and honest in his relation with you. And you have continued to show him your great and constant love by giving him a son who today rules in his place. 
111Kg 3:7 O LORD God, you have let me succeed my father as king, even though I am very young and don't know how to rule. 
111Kg 3:8 Here I am among the people you have chosen to be your own, a people who are so many that they cannot be counted. 
111Kg 3:9 So give me the wisdom I need to rule your people with justice and to know the difference between good and evil. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?" 
111Kg 3:10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this, 
111Kg 3:11 and so he said to him, "Because you have asked for the wisdom to rule justly, instead of long life for yourself or riches or the death of your enemies, 
111Kg 3:12 I will do what you have asked. I will give you more wisdom and understanding than anyone has ever had before or will ever have again. 
111Kg 3:13 I will also give you what you have not asked for�� all your life you will have wealth and honor, more than that of any other king. 
111Kg 3:14 And if you obey me and keep my laws and commands, as your father David did, I will give you a long life." 
111Kg 3:15 Solomon woke up and realized that God had spoken to him in the dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the LORD's Covenant Box and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD. After that he gave a feast for all his officials. 
111Kg 3:16 One day two prostitutes came and presented themselves before King Solomon. 
111Kg 3:17 One of them said, "Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a baby boy at home while she was there. 
111Kg 3:18 Two days after my child was born, she also gave birth to a baby boy. Only the two of us were there in the house - no one else was present. 
111Kg 3:19 Then one night she accidentally rolled over on her baby and smothered it. 
111Kg 3:20 She got up during the night, took my son from my side while I was asleep, and carried him to her bed; then she put the dead child in my bed. 
111Kg 3:21 The next morning, when I woke up and was going to nurse my baby, I saw that it was dead. I looked at it more closely and saw that it was not my child." 
111Kg 3:22 But the other woman said, "No! The living child is mine, and the dead one is yours!" The first woman answered back, "No! The dead child is yours, and the living one is mine!" And so they argued before the king. 
111Kg 3:23 Then King Solomon said, "Each of you claims that the living child is hers and that the dead child belongs to the other one." 
111Kg 3:24 He sent for a sword, and when it was brought, 
111Kg 3:25 he said, "Cut the living child in two and give each woman half of it." 
111Kg 3:26 The real mother, her heart full of love for her son, said to the king, "Please, Your Majesty, don't kill the child! Give it to her!" But the other woman said, "Don't give it to either of us; go on and cut it in two." 
111Kg 3:27 Then Solomon said, "Don't kill the child! Give it to the first woman - she is its real mother." 
111Kg 3:28 When the people of Israel heard of Solomon's decision, they were all filled with deep respect for him, because they knew then that God had given him the wisdom to settle disputes fairly. 
111Kg 4:1 Solomon was king of all Israel, 
111Kg 4:2 and these were his high officials�� The priest�� Azariah son of Zadok 
111Kg 4:3 The court secretaries�� Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha In charge of the records�� Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud 
111Kg 4:4 Commander of the army�� Benaiah son of Jehoiada Priests�� Zadok and Abiathar 
111Kg 4:5 Chief of the district governors�� Azariah son of Nathan Royal Adviser�� the priest Zabud son of Nathan 
111Kg 4:6 In charge of the palace servants�� Ahishar In charge of the forced labor�� Adoniram son of Abda 
111Kg 4:7 Solomon appointed twelve men as district governors in Israel. They were to provide food from their districts for the king and his household, each man being responsible for one month out of the year. 
111Kg 4:8 The following are the names of these twelve officers and the districts they were in charge of�� Benhur�� the hill country of Ephraim 
111Kg 4:9 Bendeker�� the cities of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, Elon, and Beth Hanan 
111Kg 4:10 Benhesed�� the cities of Arubboth and Socoh and all the territory of Hepher 
111Kg 4:11 Benabinadab, who was married to Solomon's daughter Taphath�� the whole region of Dor 
111Kg 4:12 Baana son of Ahilud�� the cities of Taanach, Megiddo, and all the region near Beth Shan, near the town of Zarethan, south of the town of Jezreel, as far as the city of Abel Meholah and the city of Jokmeam 
111Kg 4:13 Bengeber�� the city of Ramoth in Gilead, and the villages in Gilead belonging to the clan of Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, and the region of Argob in Bashan, sixty large towns in all, fortified with walls and with bronze bars on the gates 
111Kg 4:14 Ahinadab son of Iddo�� the district of Mahanaim 
111Kg 4:15 Ahimaaz, who was married to Basemath, another of Solomon's daughters�� the territory of Naphtali 
111Kg 4:16 Baana son of Hushai�� the region of Asher and the town of Bealoth 
111Kg 4:17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah�� the territory of Issachar 
111Kg 4:18 Shimei son of Ela�� the territory of Benjamin 
111Kg 4:19 Geber son of Uri�� the region of Gilead, which had been ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan Besides these twelve, there was one governor over the whole land. 
111Kg 4:20 The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; they ate and drank, and were happy. 
111Kg 4:21 Solomon's kingdom included all the nations from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border. They paid him taxes and were subject to him all his life. 
111Kg 4:22 The supplies Solomon needed each day were 150 bushels of fine flour and 300 bushels of meal; 
111Kg 4:23 10 stall-fed cattle, 20 pasture-fed cattle, and 100 sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and poultry. 
111Kg 4:24 Solomon ruled over all the land west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah on the Euphrates as far west as the city of Gaza. All the kings west of the Euphrates were subject to him, and he was at peace with all the neighboring countries. 
111Kg 4:25 As long as he lived, the people throughout Judah and Israel lived in safety, each family with its own grapevines and fig trees. 
111Kg 4:26 Solomon had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses. 
111Kg 4:27 His twelve governors, each one in the month assigned to him, supplied the food King Solomon needed for himself and for all who ate in the palace; they always supplied everything needed. 
111Kg 4:28 Each governor also supplied his share of barley and straw, where it was needed, for the chariot horses and the work animals. 
111Kg 4:29 God gave Solomon unusual wisdom and insight, and knowledge too great to be measured. 
111Kg 4:30 Solomon was wiser than the wise men of the East or the wise men of Egypt. 
111Kg 4:31 He was the wisest of all men�� wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame spread throughout all the neighboring countries. 
111Kg 4:32 He composed three thousand proverbs and more than a thousand songs. 
111Kg 4:33 He spoke of trees and plants, from the Lebanon cedars to the hyssop that grows on walls; he talked about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
111Kg 4:34 Kings all over the world heard of his wisdom and sent people to listen to him. 
111Kg 5:1 King Hiram of Tyre had always been a friend of David's, and when he heard that Solomon had succeeded his father David as king, he sent ambassadors to him. 
111Kg 5:2 Solomon sent back this message to Hiram��
111Kg 5:3 "You know that because of the constant wars my father David had to fight against the enemy countries all around him, he could not build a temple for the worship of the LORD his God until the LORD had given him victory over all his enemies. 
111Kg 5:4 But now the LORD my God has given me peace on all my borders. I have no enemies, and there is no danger of attack. 
111Kg 5:5 The LORD promised my father David, 'Your son, whom I will make king after you, will build a temple for me.' And I have now decided to build that temple for the worship of the LORD my God. 
111Kg 5:6 So send your men to Lebanon to cut down cedars for me. My men will work with them, and I will pay your men whatever you decide. As you well know, my men don't know how to cut down trees as well as yours do." 
111Kg 5:7 Hiram was extremely pleased when he received Solomon's message, and he said, "Praise the LORD today for giving David such a wise son to succeed him as king of that great nation!" 
111Kg 5:8 Then Hiram sent Solomon the following message�� "I have received your message, and I am ready to do what you ask. I will provide the cedars and the pine trees. 
111Kg 5:9 My men will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea and will tie them together in rafts to float them down the coast to the place you choose. There my men will untie them, and your men will take charge of them. On your part, I would like you to supply the food for my men." 
111Kg 5:10 So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and pine logs that he wanted, 
111Kg 5:11 and Solomon provided Hiram with 100,000 bushels of wheat and 110,000 gallons of pure olive oil every year to feed his men. 
111Kg 5:12 The LORD kept his promise and gave Solomon wisdom. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made a treaty with each other. 
111Kg 5:13 King Solomon drafted 30,000 men as forced labor from all over Israel, 
111Kg 5:14 and put Adoniram in charge of them. He divided them into three groups of 10,000 men, and each group spent one month in Lebanon and two months back home. 
111Kg 5:15 Solomon also had 80,000 stone cutters in the hill country, with 70,000 men to carry the stones, 
111Kg 5:16 and he placed 3,300 foremen in charge of them to supervise their work. 
111Kg 5:17 At King Solomon's command they cut fine large stones for the foundation of the Temple. 
111Kg 5:18 Solomon's and Hiram's workers and men from the city of Byblos prepared the stones and the timber to build the Temple. 
111Kg 6:1 Four hundred and eighty years after the people of Israel left Egypt, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the second month, the month of Ziv, Solomon began work on the Temple. 
111Kg 6:2 Inside it was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
111Kg 6:3 The entrance room was 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, as wide as the sanctuary itself. 
111Kg 6:4 The walls of the Temple had openings in them, narrower on the outside than on the inside. 
111Kg 6:5 Against the outside walls, on the sides and the back of the Temple, a three-storied annex was built, each story 7 1/2 feet high. 
111Kg 6:6 Each room in the lowest story was 7 1/2 feet wide, in the middle story 9 feet wide, and in the top story 10 1/2 feet wide. The Temple wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without having their beams built into it. 
111Kg 6:7 The stones with which the Temple was built had been prepared at the quarry, so that there was no noise made by hammers, axes, or any other iron tools as the Temple was being built. 
111Kg 6:8 The entrance to the lowest story of the annex was on the south side of the Temple, with stairs leading up to the second and third stories. 
111Kg 6:9 So King Solomon finished building the Temple. He put in a ceiling made of beams and boards of cedar. 
111Kg 6:10 The three-storied annex, each story 7 1/2 feet high, was built against the outside walls of the Temple, and was joined to them by cedar beams. 
111Kg 6:11 The LORD said to Solomon, 
111Kg 6:12 "If you obey all my laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised your father David. 
111Kg 6:13 I will live among my people Israel in this Temple that you are building, and I will never abandon them." 
111Kg 6:14 So Solomon finished building the Temple. 
111Kg 6:15 The inside walls were covered with cedar panels from the floor to the ceiling, and the floor was made of pine. 
111Kg 6:16 An inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was built in the rear of the Temple. It was 30 feet long and was partitioned off by cedar boards reaching from the floor to the ceiling. 
111Kg 6:17 The room in front of the Most Holy Place was 60 feet long. 
111Kg 6:18 The cedar panels were decorated with carvings of gourds and flowers; the whole interior was covered with cedar, so that the stones of the walls could not be seen. 
111Kg 6:19 In the rear of the Temple an inner room was built, where the LORD's Covenant Box was to be placed. 
111Kg 6:20 This inner room was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high, all covered with pure gold. The altar was covered with cedar panels. 
111Kg 6:21 The inside of the Temple was covered with gold, and gold chains were placed across the entrance of the inner room, which was also covered with gold. 
111Kg 6:22 The whole interior of the Temple was covered with gold, as well as the altar in the Most Holy Place. 
111Kg 6:23 Two winged creatures were made of olive wood and placed in the Most Holy Place, each one 15 feet tall. 
111Kg 6:24 Both were of the same size and shape. 
111Kg 6:25 Each had two wings, each wing 7 1/2 feet long, 
111Kg 6:26 so that the distance from one wing tip to the other was 15 feet.
111Kg 6:27 They were placed side by side in the Most Holy Place, so that two of their outstretched wings touched each other in the middle of the room, and the other two wings touched the walls. 
111Kg 6:28 The two winged creatures were covered with gold. 
111Kg 6:29 The walls of the main room and of the inner room were all decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers. 
111Kg 6:30 Even the floor was covered with gold. 
111Kg 6:31 A double door made of olive wood was set in place at the entrance of the Most Holy Place; the top of the doorway was a pointed arch. 
111Kg 6:32 The doors were decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers. The doors, the winged creatures, and the palm trees were covered with gold. 
111Kg 6:33 For the entrance to the main room a rectangular doorframe of olive wood was made. 
111Kg 6:34 There were two folding doors made of pine 
111Kg 6:35 and decorated with carved figures of winged creatures, palm trees, and flowers, which were evenly covered with gold. 
111Kg 6:36 An inner court was built in front of the Temple, enclosed with walls which had one layer of cedar beams for every three layers of stone. 
111Kg 6:37 The foundation of the Temple was laid in the second month, the month of Ziv, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. 
111Kg 6:38 In the eighth month, the month of Bul, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, the Temple was completely finished exactly as it had been planned. It had taken Solomon seven years to build it. 
111Kg 7:1 Solomon also built a palace for himself, and it took him thirteen years. 
111Kg 7:2 The Hall of the Forest of Lebanon was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. It had three rows of cedar pillars, 15 in each row, with cedar beams resting on them. 
111Kg 7:3 The ceiling was of cedar, extending over storerooms, which were supported by the pillars. 
111Kg 7:4 On each of the two side walls there were three rows of windows. 
111Kg 7:5 The doorways and the windows had rectangular frames, and the three rows of windows in each wall faced the opposite rows. 
111Kg 7:6 The Hall of Columns was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide. It had a covered porch, supported by columns. 
111Kg 7:7 The Throne Room, also called the Hall of Judgment, where Solomon decided cases, had cedar panels from the floor to the rafters. 
111Kg 7:8 Solomon's own quarters, in another court behind the Hall of Judgment, were made like the other buildings. He also built the same kind of house for his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt. 
111Kg 7:9 All these buildings and the great court were made of fine stones from the foundations to the eaves. The stones were prepared at the quarry and cut to measure, with their inner and outer sides trimmed with saws. 
111Kg 7:10 The foundations were made of large stones prepared at the quarry, some of them twelve feet long and others fifteen feet long. 
111Kg 7:11 On top of them were other stones, cut to measure, and cedar beams. 
111Kg 7:12 The palace court, the inner court of the Temple, and the entrance room of the Temple had walls with one layer of cedar beams for every three layers of cut stones. 
111Kg 7:13 King Solomon sent for a man named Huram, a craftsman living in the city of Tyre, who was skilled in bronze work. 
111Kg 7:14 His father, who was no longer living, was from Tyre, and had also been a skilled bronze craftsman; his mother was from the tribe of Naphtali. Huram was an intelligent and experienced craftsman. He accepted King Solomon's invitation to be in charge of all the bronze work. 
111Kg 7:15 Huram cast two bronze columns, each one 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference, and placed them at the entrance of the Temple. 
111Kg 7:16 He also made two bronze capitals, each one 7 1/2 feet tall, to be placed on top of the columns. 
111Kg 7:17 The top of each column was decorated with a design of interwoven chains 
111Kg 7:18 and two rows of bronze pomegranates. 
111Kg 7:19 The capitals were shaped like lilies, 6 feet tall, 
111Kg 7:20 and were placed on a rounded section which was above the chain design. There were 200 pomegranates in two rows around each capital. 
111Kg 7:21 Huram placed these two bronze columns in front of the entrance of the Temple�� the one on the south side was named Jachin and the one on the north was named Boaz. 
111Kg 7:22 The lily-shaped bronze capitals were on top of the columns. And so the work on the columns was completed. 
111Kg 7:23 Huram made a round tank of bronze, 7 1/2 feet deep, 15 feet in diameter, and 45 feet in circumference. 
111Kg 7:24 All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of bronze gourds, which had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank. 
111Kg 7:25 The tank rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward, three facing in each direction. 
111Kg 7:26 The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a lily. The tank held about 10,000 gallons. 
111Kg 7:27 Huram also made ten bronze carts; each was 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4 1/2 feet high. 
111Kg 7:28 They were made of square panels which were set in frames, 
111Kg 7:29 with the figures of lions, bulls, and winged creatures on the panels; and on the frames, above and underneath the lions and bulls, there were spiral figures in relief. 
111Kg 7:30 Each cart had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. At the four corners were bronze supports for a basin; the supports were decorated with spiral figures in relief. 
111Kg 7:31 There was a circular frame on top for the basin. It projected upward 18 inches from the top of the cart and 7 inches down into it. It had carvings around it. 
111Kg 7:32 The wheels were 25 inches high; they were under the panels, and the axles were of one piece with the carts. 
111Kg 7:33 The wheels were like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of bronze. 
111Kg 7:34 There were four supports at the bottom corners of each cart, which were of one piece with the cart. 
111Kg 7:35 There was a 9-inch band around the top of each cart; its supports and the panels were of one piece with the cart. 
111Kg 7:36 The supports and panels were decorated with figures of winged creatures, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was space for them, with spiral figures all around. 
111Kg 7:37 This, then, is how the carts were made; they were all alike, having the same size and shape. 
111Kg 7:38 Huram also made ten basins, one for each cart. Each basin was 6 feet in diameter and held 200 gallons. 
111Kg 7:39 He placed five of the carts on the south side of the Temple, and the other five on the north side; the tank he placed at the southeast corner. 
111Kg 7:40 Huram also made pots, shovels, and bowls.
111Kg 7:41 He completed all his work for King Solomon for the LORD's Temple.
111Kg 7:42 This is what he made�� The two columns The two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the columns The design of interwoven chains on each capital The 400 bronze pomegranates, in two rows of 100 each around the design on each capital.
111Kg 7:43 The ten carts The ten basins.
111Kg 7:44 The tank. The twelve bulls supporting the tank. The pots, shovels, and bowls.
111Kg 7:45 All this equipment for the Temple, which Huram made for King Solomon, was of polished bronze. 
111Kg 7:46 The king had it all made in the foundry between Sukkoth and Zarethan, in the Jordan Valley. 
111Kg 7:47 Solomon did not have these bronze objects weighed, because there were too many of them, and so their weight was never determined. 
111Kg 7:48 Solomon also had gold furnishings made for the Temple�� the altar, the table for the bread offered to God, 
111Kg 7:49 the ten lampstands that stood in front of the Most Holy Place, five on the south side and five on the north; the flowers, lamps, and tongs; 
111Kg 7:50 the cups, lamp snuffers, bowls, dishes for incense, and the pans used for carrying live coals; and the hinges for the doors of the Most Holy Place and of the outer doors of the Temple. All these furnishings were made of gold. 
111Kg 7:51 When King Solomon finished all the work on the Temple, he placed in the Temple storerooms all the things that his father David had dedicated to the LORD - the silver, gold, and other articles. 
111Kg 8:1 Then King Solomon summoned all the leaders of the tribes and clans of Israel to come to him in Jerusalem in order to take the LORD's Covenant Box from Zion, David's City, to the Temple. 
111Kg 8:2 They all assembled during the Festival of Shelters in the seventh month, in the month of Ethanim. 
111Kg 8:3 When all the leaders had gathered, the priests lifted the Covenant Box 
111Kg 8:4 and carried it to the Temple. The Levites and the priests also moved the Tent of the LORD's presence and all its equipment to the Temple. 
111Kg 8:5 King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle - too many to count. 
111Kg 8:6 Then the priests carried the Covenant Box into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the winged creatures. 
111Kg 8:7 Their outstretched wings covered the box and the poles it was carried by. 
111Kg 8:8 The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.) 
111Kg 8:9 There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt. 
111Kg 8:10 As the priests were leaving the Temple, it was suddenly filled with a cloud 
111Kg 8:11 shining with the dazzling light of the LORD's presence, and they could not go back in to perform their duties. 
111Kg 8:12 Then Solomon prayed�� "You, LORD, have placed the sun in the sky, yet you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness. 
111Kg 8:13 Now I have built a majestic temple for you, a place for you to live in forever." 
111Kg 8:14 As the people stood there, King Solomon turned to face them, and he asked God's blessing on them. 
111Kg 8:15 He said, "Praise the LORD God of Israel! He has kept the promise he made to my father David, when he told him, 
111Kg 8:16 'From the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen any city in all the land of Israel in which a temple should be built where I would be worshiped. But I chose you, David, to rule my people.' " 
111Kg 8:17 And Solomon continued, "My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of the LORD God of Israel, 
111Kg 8:18 but the LORD said to him, 'You were right in wanting to build a temple for me, 
111Kg 8:19 but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.' 
111Kg 8:20 "And now the LORD has kept his promise. I have succeeded my father as king of Israel, and I have built the Temple for the worship of the LORD God of Israel. 
111Kg 8:21 I have also provided a place in the Temple for the Covenant Box containing the stone tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt." 
111Kg 8:22 Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar, where he raised his arms 
111Kg 8:23 and prayed, " LORD God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below! You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you. 
111Kg 8:24 You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled. 
111Kg 8:25 And now, LORD God of Israel, I pray that you will also keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him that there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel, provided they obeyed you as carefully as he did. 
111Kg 8:26 So now, O God of Israel, let everything come true that you promised to my father David, your servant. 
111Kg 8:27 "But can you, O God, really live on earth? Not even all of heaven is large enough to hold you, so how can this Temple that I have built be large enough? 
111Kg 8:28 LORD my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer, and grant the requests I make to you today. 
111Kg 8:29 Watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have chosen to be worshiped. Hear me when I face this Temple and pray. 
111Kg 8:30 Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us. 
111Kg 8:31 "When a person is accused of wronging another and is brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that he is innocent, 
111Kg 8:32 O LORD, listen in heaven and judge your servants. Punish the guilty one as he deserves, and acquit the one who is innocent. 
111Kg 8:33 "When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness, 
111Kg 8:34 listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to their ancestors. 
111Kg 8:35 "When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you, and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you, 
111Kg 8:36 listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of the king and of the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O LORD, send rain on this land of yours, which you gave to your people as a permanent possession. 
111Kg 8:37 "When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them, 
111Kg 8:38 listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
111Kg 8:39 hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven, forgive them, and help them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each person as he deserves, 
111Kg 8:40 so that your people may obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors. 
111Kg 8:41 "When a foreigner who lives in a distant land hears of your fame and of the great things you have done for your people 
111Kg 8:42 and comes to worship you and to pray at this Temple, 
111Kg 8:43 listen to his prayer. In heaven, where you live, hear him and do what he asks you to do, so that all the peoples of the world may know you and obey you, as your people Israel do. Then they will know that this Temple I have built is the place where you are to be worshiped. 
111Kg 8:44 "When you command your people to go into battle against their enemies and they pray to you, wherever they are, facing this city which you have chosen and this Temple which I have built for you, 
111Kg 8:45 listen to their prayers. Hear them in heaven and give them victory. 
111Kg 8:46 "When your people sin against you - and there is no one who does not sin - and in your anger you let their enemies defeat them and take them as prisoners to some other land, even if that land is far away, 
111Kg 8:47 listen to your people's prayers. If there in that land they repent and pray to you, confessing how sinful and wicked they have been, hear their prayers, O LORD. 
111Kg 8:48 If in that land they truly and sincerely repent and pray to you as they face toward this land which you gave to our ancestors, this city which you have chosen, and this Temple which I have built for you, 
111Kg 8:49 then listen to their prayers. In your home in heaven hear them and be merciful to them. 
111Kg 8:50 Forgive all their sins and their rebellion against you, and make their enemies treat them with kindness. 
111Kg 8:51 They are your own people, whom you brought out of Egypt, that blazing furnace. 
111Kg 8:52 "Sovereign LORD, may you always look with favor on your people Israel and their king, and hear their prayer whenever they call to you for help. 
111Kg 8:53 You chose them from all the peoples to be your own people, as you told them through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt." 
111Kg 8:54 After Solomon had finished praying to the LORD, he stood up in front of the altar, where he had been kneeling with uplifted hands. 
111Kg 8:55 In a loud voice he asked God's blessings on all the people assembled there. He said, 
111Kg 8:56 "Praise the LORD who has given his people peace, as he promised he would. He has kept all the generous promises he made through his servant Moses. 
111Kg 8:57 May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our ancestors; may he never leave us or abandon us; 
111Kg 8:58 may he make us obedient to him, so that we will always live as he wants us to live, keeping all the laws and commands he gave our ancestors. 
111Kg 8:59 May the LORD our God remember at all times this prayer and these petitions I have made to him. May he always be merciful to the people of Israel and to their king, according to their daily needs. 
111Kg 8:60 And so all the nations of the world will know that the LORD alone is God - there is no other. 
111Kg 8:61 May you, his people, always be faithful to the LORD our God, obeying all his laws and commands as you do today." 
111Kg 8:62 Then King Solomon and all the people there offered sacrifices to the LORD. 
111Kg 8:63 He sacrificed 22,000 head of cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings. And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple. 
111Kg 8:64 That same day he also consecrated the central part of the courtyard, the area in front of the Temple, and then he offered there the sacrifices burned whole, the grain offerings, and the fat of the animals for the fellowship offerings. He did this because the bronze altar was too small for all these offerings. 
111Kg 8:65 There at the Temple, Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven days. There was a huge crowd of people from as far away as Hamath Pass in the north and the Egyptian border in the south. 
111Kg 8:66 On the eighth day Solomon sent the people home. They all praised him and went home happy because of all the blessings that the LORD had given his servant David and his people Israel. 
111Kg 9:1 After King Solomon had finished building the Temple and the palace and everything else he wanted to build, 
111Kg 9:2 the LORD appeared to him again, as he had in Gibeon. 
111Kg 9:3 The LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer. I consecrate this Temple which you have built as the place where I shall be worshiped forever. I will watch over it and protect it for all time. 
111Kg 9:4 If you will serve me in honesty and integrity, as your father David did, and if you obey my laws and do everything I have commanded you, 
111Kg 9:5 I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants. 
111Kg 9:6 But if you or your descendants stop following me, disobey the laws and commands I have given you, and worship other gods, 
111Kg 9:7 then I will remove my people Israel from the land that I have given them. I will also abandon this Temple which I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule Israel and treat her with contempt. 
111Kg 9:8 This Temple will become a pile of ruins, and everyone who passes by will be shocked and amazed. 'Why did the LORD do this to this land and this Temple?' they will ask. 
111Kg 9:9 People will answer, 'It is because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They gave their allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. That is why the LORD has brought this disaster on them.' " 
111Kg 9:10 It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace. 
111Kg 9:11 King Hiram of Tyre had provided him with all the cedar and pine and with all the gold he wanted for this work. After it was finished, King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee. 
111Kg 9:12 Hiram went to see them, and he did not like them. 
111Kg 9:13 So he said to Solomon, "So these, my brother, are the towns you have given me!" For this reason the area is still called Cabul. 
111Kg 9:14 Hiram had sent Solomon almost five tons of gold. 
111Kg 9:15 King Solomon used forced labor to build the Temple and the palace, to fill in land on the east side of the city, and to build the city wall. He also used it to rebuild the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
111Kg 9:16 (The king of Egypt had attacked Gezer and captured it, killing its inhabitants and setting fire to the city. Then he gave it as a wedding present to his daughter when she married Solomon, 
111Kg 9:17 and Solomon rebuilt it.) Using his forced labor, Solomon also rebuilt Lower Beth Horon, 
111Kg 9:18 Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness of Judah, 
111Kg 9:19 the cities where his supplies were kept, the cities for his horses and chariots, and everything else he wanted to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and elsewhere in his kingdom. 
111Kg 9:20 For his forced labor Solomon used the descendants of the people of Canaan whom the Israelites had not killed when they took possession of their land. 
111Kg 9:21 These included Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, whose descendants continue to be slaves down to the present time. 
111Kg 9:22 Solomon did not make slaves of Israelites; they served as his soldiers, officers, commanders, chariot captains, and cavalry. 
111Kg 9:23 There were 550 officials in charge of the forced labor working on Solomon's various building projects. 
111Kg 9:24 Solomon filled in the land on the east side of the city, after his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, had moved from David's City to the palace Solomon built for her. 
111Kg 9:25 Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built to the LORD. He also burned incense to the LORD. And so he finished building the Temple. 
111Kg 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Eziongeber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land of Edom. 
111Kg 9:27 King Hiram sent some experienced sailors from his fleet to serve with Solomon's men. 
111Kg 9:28 They sailed to the land of Ophir and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold. 
111Kg 10:1 The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, and she traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. 
111Kg 10:2 She brought with her a large group of attendants, as well as camels loaded with spices, jewels, and a large amount of gold. When she and Solomon met, she asked him all the questions that she could think of. 
111Kg 10:3 He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain. 
111Kg 10:4 The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built. 
111Kg 10:5 She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered in the Temple. It left her breathless and amazed. 
111Kg 10:6 She said to King Solomon, "What I heard in my own country about you and your wisdom is true! 
111Kg 10:7 But I couldn't believe it until I had come and seen it all for myself. But I didn't hear even half of it; your wisdom and wealth are much greater than what I was told. 
111Kg 10:8 How fortunate are your wives! And how fortunate your servants, who are always in your presence and are privileged to hear your wise sayings! 
111Kg 10:9 Praise the LORD your God! He has shown how pleased he is with you by making you king of Israel. Because his love for Israel is eternal, he has made you their king so that you can maintain law and justice." 
111Kg 10:10 She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought�� almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. The amount of spices she gave him was by far the greatest that he ever received at any time. 
111Kg 10:11 (Hiram's fleet, which had brought gold from Ophir, also brought from there a large amount of juniper wood and jewels. 
111Kg 10:12 Solomon used the wood to build railings in the Temple and the palace, and also to make harps and lyres for the musicians. It was the finest juniper wood ever imported into Israel; none like it has ever been seen again.) 
111Kg 10:13 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for, besides all the other customary gifts that he had generously given her. Then she and her attendants returned to the land of Sheba. 
111Kg 10:14 Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold, 
111Kg 10:15 in addition to the taxes paid by merchants, the profits from trade, and tribute paid by the Arabian kings and the governors of the Israelite districts. 
111Kg 10:16 Solomon made two hundred large shields and had each one overlaid with almost fifteen pounds of gold. 
111Kg 10:17 He also made three hundred smaller shields, overlaying each one of them with nearly four pounds of gold. He had all these shields placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon. 
111Kg 10:18 He also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with the finest gold. 
111Kg 10:19 The throne had six steps leading up to it, with the figure of a lion at each end of every step, a total of twelve lions. At the back of the throne was the figure of a bull's head, and beside each of the two armrests was the figure of a lion. 
111Kg 10:20 No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom.
111Kg 10:21 All of Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. No silver was used, since it was not considered valuable in Solomon's day. 
111Kg 10:22 He had a fleet of ocean-going ships sailing with Hiram's fleet. Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys. 
111Kg 10:23 King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king, 
111Kg 10:24 and the whole world wanted to come and listen to the wisdom that God had given him. 
111Kg 10:25 Everyone who came brought him a gift - articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year. 
111Kg 10:26 Solomon built up a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem and the rest he stationed in various other cities. 
111Kg 10:27 During his reign silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
111Kg 10:28 The king's agents controlled the export of horses from Musri and Cilicia, 
111Kg 10:29 and the export of chariots from Egypt. They supplied the Hittite and Syrian kings with horses and chariots, selling chariots for 600 pieces of silver each and horses for 150 each. 
111Kg 11:1 Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides the daughter of the king of Egypt he married Hittite women and women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon. 
111Kg 11:2 He married them even though the LORD had commanded the Israelites not to intermarry with these people, because they would cause the Israelites to give their loyalty to other gods. 
111Kg 11:3 Solomon married seven hundred princesses and also had three hundred concubines. They made him turn away from God, 
111Kg 11:4 and by the time he was old they had led him into the worship of foreign gods. He was not faithful to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. 
111Kg 11:5 He worshiped Astarte, the goddess of Sidon, and Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. 
111Kg 11:6 He sinned against the LORD and was not true to him as his father David had been. 
111Kg 11:7 On the mountain east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. 
111Kg 11:8 He also built places of worship where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods. 
111Kg 11:9 Even though the LORD, the God of Israel, had appeared to Solomon twice and had commanded him not to worship foreign gods, 
111Kg 11:10 Solomon did not obey the LORD but turned away from him. So the LORD was angry with Solomon
111Kg 11:11 and said to him, "Because you have deliberately broken your covenant with me and disobeyed my commands, I promise that I will take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your officials. 
111Kg 11:12 However, for the sake of your father David I will not do this in your lifetime, but during the reign of your son. 
111Kg 11:13 And I will not take the whole kingdom away from him; instead, I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have made my own." 
111Kg 11:14 So the LORD caused Hadad, of the royal family of Edom, to turn against Solomon. 
111Kg 11:15 Long before this, when David had conquered Edom, Joab the commander of his army had gone there to bury the dead. 
111Kg 11:16 He and his men remained in Edom six months, and during that time they killed every male in Edom 
111Kg 11:17 except Hadad and some of his father's Edomite servants, who escaped to Egypt. (At that time Hadad was just a child.) 
111Kg 11:18 They left Midian and went to Paran, where some other men joined them. Then they traveled to Egypt and went to the king, who gave Hadad some land and a house and provided him with food. 
111Kg 11:19 Hadad won the friendship of the king, and the king gave his sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, to Hadad in marriage. 
111Kg 11:20 She bore him a son, Genubath, who was raised by the queen in the palace, where he lived with the king's sons. 
111Kg 11:21 When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David had died and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to the king, "Let me go back to my own country." 
111Kg 11:22 "Why?" the king asked. "Have I failed to give you something? Is that why you want to go back home?" "Just let me go," Hadad answered the king. And he went back to his country. As king of Edom, Hadad was an evil, bitter enemy of Israel. 
111Kg 11:23 God also caused Rezon son of Eliada to turn against Solomon. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
111Kg 11:24 and had become the leader of a gang of outlaws. (This happened after David had defeated Hadadezer and had slaughtered his Syrian allies.) Rezon and his gang went and lived in Damascus, where his followers made him king of Syria. 
111Kg 11:25 He was an enemy of Israel during the lifetime of Solomon. 
111Kg 11:26 Another man who turned against King Solomon was one of his officials, Jeroboam son of Nebat, from Zeredah in Ephraim. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. 
111Kg 11:27 This is the story of the revolt. Solomon was filling in the land on the east side of Jerusalem and repairing the city walls. 
111Kg 11:28 Jeroboam was an able young man, and when Solomon noticed how hard he worked, he put him in charge of all the forced labor in the territory of the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim. 
111Kg 11:29 One day, as Jeroboam was traveling from Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him alone on the road in the open country. 
111Kg 11:30 Ahijah took off the new robe he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, 
111Kg 11:31 and said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, because the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, 'I am going to take the kingdom away from Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. 
111Kg 11:32 Solomon will keep one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to be my own from the whole land of Israel. 
111Kg 11:33 I am going to do this because Solomon has rejected me and has worshiped foreign gods�� Astarte, the goddess of Sidon; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Molech, the god of Ammon. Solomon has disobeyed me; he has done wrong and has not kept my laws and commands as his father David did. 
111Kg 11:34 But I will not take the whole kingdom away from Solomon, and I will keep him in power as long as he lives. This I will do for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who obeyed my laws and commands. 
111Kg 11:35 I will take the kingdom away from Solomon's son and will give you ten tribes, 
111Kg 11:36 but I will let Solomon's son keep one tribe, so that I will always have a descendant of my servant David ruling in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen as the place where I am worshiped. 
111Kg 11:37 Jeroboam, I will make you king of Israel, and you will rule over all the territory that you want. 
111Kg 11:38 If you obey me completely, live by my laws, and win my approval by doing what I command, as my servant David did, I will always be with you. I will make you king of Israel and will make sure that your descendants rule after you, just as I have done for David. 
111Kg 11:39 Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David, but not for all time.' " 
111Kg 11:40 And so Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he escaped to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon's death. 
111Kg 11:41 Everything else that Solomon did, his career, and his wisdom, are all recorded in The History of Solomon.
111Kg 11:42 He was king in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
111Kg 11:43 He died and was buried in David's City, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 12:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king. 
111Kg 12:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned from Egypt. 
111Kg 12:3 The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and then they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him, 
111Kg 12:4 "Your father Solomon treated us harshly and placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects." 
111Kg 12:5 "Come back in three days and I will give you my answer," he replied. So they left. 
111Kg 12:6 King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. "What answer do you advise me to give these people?" he asked. 
111Kg 12:7 They replied, "If you want to serve this people well, give a favorable answer to their request, and they will always serve you loyally." 
111Kg 12:8 But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers. 
111Kg 12:9 "What do you advise me to do?" he asked. "What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?" 
111Kg 12:10 They replied, "This is what you should tell them�� 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist!' 
111Kg 12:11 Tell them, 'My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!' " 
111Kg 12:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them. 
111Kg 12:13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people, 
111Kg 12:14 as the younger men had advised. He said, "My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!" 
111Kg 12:15 It was the will of the LORD to bring about what he had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh. This is why the king did not pay any attention to the people. 
111Kg 12:16 When the people saw that the king would not listen to them, they shouted, "Down with David and his family! What have they ever done for us? People of Israel, let's go home! Let Rehoboam look out for himself !" So the people of Israel rebelled, 
111Kg 12:17 leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah. 
111Kg 12:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
111Kg 12:19 Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David. 
111Kg 12:20 When the people of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they invited him to a meeting of the people and made him king of Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David's descendants. 
111Kg 12:21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel. 
111Kg 12:22 But God told the prophet Shemaiah 
111Kg 12:23 to give this message to Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin��
111Kg 12:24 "Do not attack your own relatives, the people of Israel. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will." They all obeyed the LORD's command and went back home. 
111Kg 12:25 King Jeroboam of Israel fortified the town of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there for a while. Then he left and fortified the town of Penuel. 
111Kg 12:26 He said to himself, "As things are now, if my people go to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices to the LORD in the Temple there, 
111Kg 12:27 they will transfer their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah and will kill me." 
111Kg 12:28 After thinking it over, he made two bull-calves of gold and said to his people, "You have been going long enough to Jerusalem to worship. People of Israel, here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt!" 
111Kg 12:29 He placed one of the gold bull-calves in Bethel and the other in Dan. 
111Kg 12:30 And so the people sinned, going to worship in Bethel and in Dan. 
111Kg 12:31 Jeroboam also built places of worship on hilltops, and he chose priests from families who were not of the tribe of Levi. 
111Kg 12:32 Jeroboam also instituted a religious festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival in Judah. On the altar in Bethel he offered sacrifices to the gold bull-calves he had made, and he placed there in Bethel the priests serving at the places of worship he had built. 
111Kg 12:33 And on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the day that he himself had set, he went to Bethel and offered a sacrifice on the altar in celebration of the festival he had instituted for the people of Israel. 
111Kg 13:1 At the LORD's command a prophet from Judah went to Bethel and arrived there as Jeroboam stood at the altar to offer the sacrifice. 
111Kg 13:2 Following the LORD's command, the prophet denounced the altar�� "O altar, altar, this is what the LORD says�� A child, whose name will be Josiah, will be born to the family of David. He will slaughter on you the priests serving at the pagan altars who offer sacrifices on you, and he will burn human bones on you." 
111Kg 13:3 And the prophet went on to say, "This altar will fall apart, and the ashes on it will be scattered. Then you will know that the LORD has spoken through me." 
111Kg 13:4 When King Jeroboam heard this, he pointed at him and ordered, "Seize that man!" At once the king's arm became paralyzed so that he couldn't pull it back. 
111Kg 13:5 The altar suddenly fell apart and the ashes spilled to the ground, as the prophet had predicted in the name of the LORD. 
111Kg 13:6 King Jeroboam said to the prophet, "Please pray for me to the LORD your God, and ask him to heal my arm!" The prophet prayed to the LORD, and the king's arm was healed. 
111Kg 13:7 Then the king said to the prophet, "Come home with me and have something to eat. I will reward you for what you have done." 
111Kg 13:8 The prophet answered, "Even if you gave me half of your wealth, I would not go with you or eat or drink anything with you. 
111Kg 13:9 The LORD has commanded me not to eat or drink a thing, and not to return home the same way I came." 
111Kg 13:10 So he did not go back the same way he had come, but by another road. 
111Kg 13:11 At that time there was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the prophet from Judah had done in Bethel that day and what he had said to King Jeroboam. 
111Kg 13:12 "Which way did he go when he left?" the old prophet asked them. They showed him the road 
111Kg 13:13 and he told them to saddle his donkey for him. They did so, and he rode off 
111Kg 13:14 down the road after the prophet from Judah and found him sitting under an oak tree. "Are you the prophet from Judah?" he asked. "I am," the man answered. 
111Kg 13:15 "Come home and have a meal with me," he said. 
111Kg 13:16 But the prophet from Judah answered, "I can't go home with you or accept your hospitality. And I won't eat or drink anything with you here, 
111Kg 13:17 because the LORD has commanded me not to eat or drink a thing, and not to return home the same way I came." 
111Kg 13:18 Then the old prophet from Bethel said to him, "I, too, am a prophet just like you, and at the LORD's command an angel told me to take you home with me and offer you my hospitality." But the old prophet was lying. 
111Kg 13:19 So the prophet from Judah went home with the old prophet and had a meal with him. 
111Kg 13:20 As they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet, 
111Kg 13:21 and he cried out to the prophet from Judah, "The LORD says that you disobeyed him and did not do what he commanded. 
111Kg 13:22 Instead, you returned and ate a meal in a place he had ordered you not to eat in. Because of this you will be killed, and your body will not be buried in your family grave." 
111Kg 13:23 After they had finished eating, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet from Judah, 
111Kg 13:24 who rode off. On the way a lion met him and killed him. His body lay on the road, and the donkey and the lion stood beside it. 
111Kg 13:25 Some men passed by and saw the body on the road, with the lion standing near by. They went on into Bethel and reported what they had seen. 
111Kg 13:26 When the old prophet heard about it, he said, "That is the prophet who disobeyed the LORD's command! And so the LORD sent the lion to attack and kill him, just as the LORD said he would." 
111Kg 13:27 Then he said to his sons, "Saddle my donkey for me." They did so, 
111Kg 13:28 and he rode off and found the prophet's body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing by it. The lion had not eaten the body or attacked the donkey. 
111Kg 13:29 The old prophet picked up the body, put it on the donkey, and brought it back to Bethel to mourn over it and bury it. 
111Kg 13:30 He buried it in his own family grave, and he and his sons mourned over it, saying, "Oh my brother, my brother!" 
111Kg 13:31 After the burial the prophet said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in this grave and lay my body next to his. 
111Kg 13:32 The words that he spoke at the LORD's command against the altar in Bethel and against all the places of worship in the towns of Samaria will surely come true." 
111Kg 13:33 King Jeroboam of Israel still did not turn from his evil ways but continued to choose priests from ordinary families to serve at the altars he had built. He ordained as priest anyone who wanted to be one. 
111Kg 13:34 This sin on his part brought about the ruin and total destruction of his dynasty. 
111Kg 14:1 At that time King Jeroboam's son Abijah got sick. 
111Kg 14:2 Jeroboam said to his wife, "Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you, and go to Shiloh, where the prophet Ahijah lives, the one who said I would be king of Israel. 
111Kg 14:3 Take him ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Ask him what is going to happen to our son, and he will tell you." 
111Kg 14:4 So she went to Ahijah's home in Shiloh. Old age had made Ahijah blind. 
111Kg 14:5 The LORD had told him that Jeroboam's wife was coming to ask him about her son, who was sick. And the LORD told Ahijah what to say. When Jeroboam's wife arrived, she pretended to be someone else. 
111Kg 14:6 But when Ahijah heard her coming in the door, he said, "Come in. I know you are Jeroboam's wife. Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have bad news for you. 
111Kg 14:7 Go and tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to him�� 'I chose you from among the people and made you the ruler of my people Israel. 
111Kg 14:8 I took the kingdom away from David's descendants and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who was completely loyal to me, obeyed my commands, and did only what I approve of. 
111Kg 14:9 You have committed far greater sins than those who ruled before you. You have rejected me and have aroused my anger by making idols and metal images to worship. 
111Kg 14:10 Because of this I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will kill all your male descendants, young and old alike. I will get rid of your family; they will be swept away like dung. 
111Kg 14:11 Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures. I, the LORD, have spoken.' " 
111Kg 14:12 And Ahijah went on to say to Jeroboam's wife, "Now go back home. As soon as you enter the town, your son will die. 
111Kg 14:13 All the people of Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He will be the only member of Jeroboam's family who will be properly buried, because he is the only one with whom the LORD, the God of Israel, is pleased. 
111Kg 14:14 The LORD is going to place a king over Israel who will put an end to Jeroboam's dynasty. 
111Kg 14:15 The LORD will punish Israel, and she will shake like a reed shaking in a stream. He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land which he gave to their ancestors, and he will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have aroused his anger by making idols of the goddess Asherah. 
111Kg 14:16 The LORD will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and led the people of Israel into sin." 
111Kg 14:17 Jeroboam's wife went back to Tirzah. Just as she entered her home, the child died. 
111Kg 14:18 The people of Israel mourned for him and buried him, as the LORD had said through his servant, the prophet Ahijah. 
111Kg 14:19 Everything else that King Jeroboam did, the wars he fought and how he ruled, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 14:20 Jeroboam ruled as king for twenty-two years. He died and was buried, and his son Nadab succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 14:21 Solomon's son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah from Ammon. 
111Kg 14:22 The people of Judah sinned against the LORD and did more to arouse his anger against them than all their ancestors had done. 
111Kg 14:23 They built places of worship for false gods and put up stone pillars and symbols of Asherah to worship on the hills and under shady trees. 
111Kg 14:24 Worst of all, there were men and women who served as prostitutes at those pagan places of worship. The people of Judah practiced all the shameful things done by the people whom the LORD had driven out of the land as the Israelites advanced into the country. 
111Kg 14:25 In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
111Kg 14:26 He took away all the treasures in the Temple and in the palace, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 
111Kg 14:27 To replace them, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates. 
111Kg 14:28 Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom. 
111Kg 14:29 Everything else that King Rehoboam did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
111Kg 14:30 During all this time Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly at war with each other. 
111Kg 14:31 Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 15:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah, 
111Kg 15:2 and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. 
111Kg 15:3 He committed the same sins as his father and was not completely loyal to the LORD his God, as his great-grandfather David had been. 
111Kg 15:4 But for David's sake the LORD his God gave Abijah a son to rule after him in Jerusalem and to keep Jerusalem secure. 
111Kg 15:5 The LORD did this because David had done what pleased him and had never disobeyed any of his commands, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite. 
111Kg 15:6 The war which had begun between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continued throughout Abijah's lifetime. 
111Kg 15:7 And everything else that Abijah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
111Kg 15:8 Abijah died and was buried in David's City, and his son Asa succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 15:9 In the twentieth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa became king of Judah, 
111Kg 15:10 and he ruled forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. 
111Kg 15:11 Asa did what pleased the LORD, as his ancestor David had done. 
111Kg 15:12 He expelled from the country all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan places of worship, and he removed all the idols his predecessors had made. 
111Kg 15:13 He removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol and burned it in Kidron Valley. 
111Kg 15:14 Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship, he remained faithful to the LORD all his life. 
111Kg 15:15 He placed in the Temple all the objects his father had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated. 
111Kg 15:16 King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power. 
111Kg 15:17 Baasha invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah. 
111Kg 15:18 So King Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the Temple and the palace, and sent it by some of his officials to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion, with this message��
111Kg 15:19 "Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel, so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory." 
111Kg 15:20 King Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, the area near Lake Galilee, and the whole territory of Naphtali. 
111Kg 15:21 When King Baasha heard what had happened, he stopped fortifying Ramah and went to Tirzah. 
111Kg 15:22 Then King Asa sent out an order throughout all of Judah requiring everyone, without exception, to help carry away from Ramah the stones and timber that Baasha had been using to fortify it. With this material Asa fortified Mizpah and Geba, a city in the territory of Benjamin. 
111Kg 15:23 Everything else that King Asa did, his brave deeds and the towns he fortified, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.But in his old age he was crippled by a foot disease.
111Kg 15:24 Asa died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 15:25 In the second year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Jeroboam's son Nadab became king of Israel, and he ruled for two years. 
111Kg 15:26 Like his father before him, he sinned against the LORD and led Israel into sin. 
111Kg 15:27 Baasha son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar, plotted against Nadab and killed him as Nadab and his army were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia. 
111Kg 15:28 This happened during the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah. And so Baasha succeeded Nadab as king of Israel. 
111Kg 15:29 At once he began killing all the members of Jeroboam's family. In accordance with what the LORD had said through his servant, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh, all of Jeroboam's family were killed; not one survived. 
111Kg 15:30 This happened because Jeroboam aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, by the sins that he committed and that he caused Israel to commit. 
111Kg 15:31 Everything else that Nadab did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 15:32 King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel were constantly at war with each other as long as they were in power. 
111Kg 15:33 In the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years. 
111Kg 15:34 Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against the LORD and led Israel into sin. 
111Kg 16:1 The LORD spoke to the prophet Jehu son of Hanani and gave him this message for Baasha��
111Kg 16:2 "You were a nobody, but I made you the leader of my people Israel. And now you have sinned like Jeroboam and have led my people into sin. Their sins have aroused my anger, 
111Kg 16:3 and so I will do away with you and your family, just as I did with Jeroboam. 
111Kg 16:4 Any members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures." 
111Kg 16:5 Everything else that Baasha did and all his brave deeds are recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:6 Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 16:7 That message from the LORD against Baasha and his family was given by the prophet Jehu because of the sins that Baasha committed against the LORD. He aroused the LORD's anger not only because of the evil he did, just as King Jeroboam had done before him, but also because he killed all of Jeroboam's family. 
111Kg 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he ruled in Tirzah for two years. 
111Kg 16:9 Zimri, one of his officers who was in charge of half of the king's chariots, plotted against him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk in the home of Arza, who was in charge of the palace. 
111Kg 16:10 Zimri entered the house, assassinated Elah, and succeeded him as king. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah. 
111Kg 16:11 As soon as Zimri became king he killed off all the members of Baasha's family. Every male relative and friend was put to death. 
111Kg 16:12 And so, in accordance with what the LORD had said against Baasha through the prophet Jehu, Zimri killed all the family of Baasha. 
111Kg 16:13 Because of their idolatry and because they led Israel into sin, Baasha and his son Elah had aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
111Kg 16:14 Everything else that Elah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Zimri ruled in Tirzah over Israel for seven days. The Israelite troops were besieging the city of Gibbethon in Philistia, 
111Kg 16:16 and when they heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and assassinated him, then and there they all proclaimed their commander Omri king of Israel. 
111Kg 16:17 Omri and his troops left Gibbethon and went and besieged Tirzah. 
111Kg 16:18 When Zimri saw that the city had fallen, he went into the palace's inner fortress, set the palace on fire, and died in the flames. 
111Kg 16:19 This happened because of his sins against the LORD. Like his predecessor Jeroboam, he displeased the LORD by his own sins and by leading Israel into sin. 
111Kg 16:20 Everything else that Zimri did, including the account of his conspiracy, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:21 The people of Israel were divided�� some of them wanted to make Tibni son of Ginath king, and the others were in favor of Omri. 
111Kg 16:22 In the end, those in favor of Omri won out; Tibni died and Omri became king. 
111Kg 16:23 So in the thirty-first year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled for twelve years. The first six years he ruled in Tirzah, 
111Kg 16:24 and then he bought the hill of Samaria for six thousand pieces of silver from a man named Shemer. Omri fortified the hill, built a town there, and named it Samaria, after Shemer, the former owner of the hill. 
111Kg 16:25 Omri sinned against the LORD more than any of his predecessors. 
111Kg 16:26 Like Jeroboam before him, he aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, by his sins and by leading the people into sin and idolatry. 
111Kg 16:27 Everything else that Omri did and all his accomplishments are recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:28 Omri died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 16:29 In the thirty-eighth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twenty-two years. 
111Kg 16:30 He sinned against the LORD more than any of his predecessors. 
111Kg 16:31 It was not enough for him to sin like King Jeroboam; he went further and married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon, and worshiped Baal. 
111Kg 16:32 He built a temple to Baal in Samaria, made an altar for him, and put it in the temple. 
111Kg 16:33 He also put up an image of the goddess Asherah. He did more to arouse the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, than all the kings of Israel before him. 
111Kg 16:34 During his reign Hiel from Bethel rebuilt Jericho. As the LORD had foretold through Joshua son of Nun, Hiel lost his oldest son Abiram when he laid the foundation of Jericho, and his youngest son Segub when he built the gates. 
111Kg 17:1 A prophet named Elijah, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to King Ahab, "In the name of the LORD, the living God of Israel, whom I serve, I tell you that there will be no dew or rain for the next two or three years until I say so." 
111Kg 17:2 Then the LORD said to Elijah, 
111Kg 17:3 "Leave this place and go east and hide yourself near Cherith Brook, east of the Jordan. 
111Kg 17:4 The brook will supply you with water to drink, and I have commanded ravens to bring you food there." 
111Kg 17:5 Elijah obeyed the LORD's command, and went and stayed by Cherith Brook. 
111Kg 17:6 He drank water from the brook, and ravens brought him bread and meat every morning and every evening. 
111Kg 17:7 After a while the brook dried up because of the lack of rain. 
111Kg 17:8 Then the LORD said to Elijah, 
111Kg 17:9 "Now go to the town of Zarephath, near Sidon, and stay there. I have commanded a widow who lives there to feed you." 
111Kg 17:10 So Elijah went to Zarephath, and as he came to the town gate, he saw a widow gathering firewood. "Please bring me a drink of water," he said to her. 
111Kg 17:11 And as she was going to get it, he called out, "And please bring me some bread, too." 
111Kg 17:12 She answered, "By the living LORD your God I swear that I don't have any bread. All I have is a handful of flour in a bowl and a bit of olive oil in a jar. I came here to gather some firewood to take back home and prepare what little I have for my son and me. That will be our last meal, and then we will starve to death." 
111Kg 17:13 "Don't worry," Elijah said to her. "Go on and prepare your meal. But first make a small loaf from what you have and bring it to me, and then prepare the rest for you and your son. 
111Kg 17:14 For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� 'The bowl will not run out of flour or the jar run out of oil before the day that I, the LORD, send rain.' " 
111Kg 17:15 The widow went and did as Elijah had told her, and all of them had enough food for many days. 
111Kg 17:16 As the LORD had promised through Elijah, the bowl did not run out of flour nor did the jar run out of oil. 
111Kg 17:17 Some time later the widow's son got sick; he got worse and worse, and finally he died. 
111Kg 17:18 She said to Elijah, "Man of God, why did you do this to me? Did you come here to remind God of my sins and so cause my son's death?" 
111Kg 17:19 "Give the boy to me," Elijah said. He took the boy from her arms, carried him upstairs to the room where he was staying, and laid him on the bed. 
111Kg 17:20 Then he prayed aloud, "O LORD my God, why have you done such a terrible thing to this widow? She has been kind enough to take care of me, and now you kill her son!" 
111Kg 17:21 Then Elijah stretched himself out on the boy three times and prayed, "O LORD my God, restore this child to life!" 
111Kg 17:22 The LORD answered Elijah's prayer; the child started breathing again and revived. 
111Kg 17:23 Elijah took the boy back downstairs to his mother and said to her, "Look, your son is alive!" 
111Kg 17:24 She answered, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the LORD really speaks through you!" 
111Kg 18:1 After some time, in the third year of the drought, the LORD said to Elijah, "Go and present yourself to King Ahab, and I will send rain." 
111Kg 18:2 So Elijah started out. The famine in Samaria was at its worst, 
111Kg 18:3 so Ahab called in Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devout worshiper of the LORD, 
111Kg 18:4 and when Jezebel was killing the LORD's prophets, Obadiah took a hundred of them, hid them in caves in two groups of fifty, and provided them with food and water.) 
111Kg 18:5 Ahab said to Obadiah, "Let us go and look at every spring and every stream bed in the land to see if we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive. Maybe we won't have to kill any of our animals." 
111Kg 18:6 They agreed on which part of the land each one would explore, and set off in different directions. 
111Kg 18:7 As Obadiah was on his way, he suddenly met Elijah. He recognized him, bowed low before him, and asked, "Is it really you, sir?" 
111Kg 18:8 "Yes, I'm Elijah," he answered. "Go and tell your master the king that I am here." 
111Kg 18:9 Obadiah answered, "What have I done that you want to put me in danger of being killed by King Ahab? 
111Kg 18:10 By the living LORD, your God, I swear that the king has made a search for you in every country in the world. Whenever the ruler of a country reported that you were not in his country, Ahab would require that ruler to swear that you could not be found. 
111Kg 18:11 And now you want me to go and tell him that you are here? 
111Kg 18:12 What if the spirit of the LORD carries you off to some unknown place as soon as I leave? Then, when I tell Ahab that you are here and he can't find you, he will put me to death. Remember that I have been a devout worshiper of the LORD ever since I was a boy. 
111Kg 18:13 Haven't you heard that when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD I hid a hundred of them in caves, in two groups of fifty, and supplied them with food and water? 
111Kg 18:14 So how can you order me to go and tell the king that you are here? He will kill me!" 
111Kg 18:15 Elijah answered, "By the living LORD Almighty, whom I serve, I promise that I will present myself to the king today." 
111Kg 18:16 So Obadiah went to King Ahab and told him, and Ahab set off to meet Elijah. 
111Kg 18:17 When Ahab saw him, he said, "So there you are - the worst troublemaker in Israel!" 
111Kg 18:18 "I'm not the troublemaker," Elijah answered. "You are - you and your father. You are disobeying the LORD's commands and worshiping the idols of Baal. 
111Kg 18:19 Now order all the people of Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel. Bring along the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the goddess Asherah who are supported by Queen Jezebel." 
111Kg 18:20 So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and the prophets of Baal to meet at Mount Carmel. 
111Kg 18:21 Elijah went up to the people and said, "How much longer will it take you to make up your minds? If the LORD is God, worship him; but if Baal is God, worship him!" But the people didn't say a word. 
111Kg 18:22 Then Elijah said, "I am the only prophet of the LORD still left, but there are 450 prophets of Baal. 
111Kg 18:23 Bring two bulls; let the prophets of Baal take one, kill it, cut it in pieces, and put it on the wood - but don't light the fire. I will do the same with the other bull. 
111Kg 18:24 Then let the prophets of Baal pray to their god, and I will pray to the LORD, and the one who answers by sending fire - he is God." The people shouted their approval. 
111Kg 18:25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Since there are so many of you, you take a bull and prepare it first. Pray to your god, but don't set fire to the wood." 
111Kg 18:26 They took the bull that was brought to them, prepared it, and prayed to Baal until noon. They shouted, "Answer us, Baal!" and kept dancing around the altar they had built. But no answer came. 
111Kg 18:27 At noon Elijah started making fun of them�� "Pray louder! He is a god! Maybe he is day-dreaming or relieving himself, or perhaps he's gone off on a trip! Or maybe he's sleeping, and you've got to wake him up!" 
111Kg 18:28 So the prophets prayed louder and cut themselves with knives and daggers, according to their ritual, until blood flowed. 
111Kg 18:29 They kept on ranting and raving until the middle of the afternoon; but no answer came, not a sound was heard. 
111Kg 18:30 Then Elijah said to the people, "Come closer to me," and they all gathered around him. He set about repairing the altar of the LORD which had been torn down. 
111Kg 18:31 He took twelve stones, one for each of the twelve tribes named for the sons of Jacob, the man to whom the LORD had given the name Israel. 
111Kg 18:32 With these stones he rebuilt the altar for the worship of the LORD. He dug a trench around it, large enough to hold about four gallons of water. 
111Kg 18:33 Then he placed the wood on the altar, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, "Fill four jars with water and pour it on the offering and the wood." They did so, 
111Kg 18:34 and he said, "Do it again" - and they did. "Do it once more," he said - and they did. 
111Kg 18:35 The water ran down around the altar and filled the trench. 
111Kg 18:36 At the hour of the afternoon sacrifice the prophet Elijah approached the altar and prayed, "O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, prove now that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant and have done all this at your command. 
111Kg 18:37 Answer me, LORD, answer me, so that this people will know that you, the LORD, are God and that you are bringing them back to yourself." 
111Kg 18:38 The LORD sent fire down, and it burned up the sacrifice, the wood, and the stones, scorched the earth and dried up the water in the trench. 
111Kg 18:39 When the people saw this, they threw themselves on the ground and exclaimed, "The LORD is God; the LORD alone is God!" 
111Kg 18:40 Elijah ordered, "Seize the prophets of Baal; don't let any of them get away!" The people seized them all, and Elijah led them down to Kishon Brook and killed them. 
111Kg 18:41 Then Elijah said to King Ahab, "Now, go and eat. I hear the roar of rain approaching." 
111Kg 18:42 While Ahab went to eat, Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel, where he bowed down to the ground, with his head between his knees. 
111Kg 18:43 He said to his servant, "Go and look toward the sea." The servant went and returned, saying, "I didn't see a thing." Seven times in all Elijah told him to go and look. 
111Kg 18:44 The seventh time he returned and said, "I saw a little cloud no bigger than a man's hand, coming up from the sea." Elijah ordered his servant, "Go to King Ahab and tell him to get in his chariot and go back home before the rain stops him." 
111Kg 18:45 In a little while the sky was covered with dark clouds, the wind began to blow, and a heavy rain began to fall. Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel. 
111Kg 18:46 The power of the LORD came on Elijah; he fastened his clothes tight around his waist and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel. 
111Kg 19:1 King Ahab told his wife Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets of Baal to death. 
111Kg 19:2 She sent a message to Elijah�� "May the gods strike me dead if by this time tomorrow I don't do the same thing to you that you did to the prophets." 
111Kg 19:3 Elijah was afraid and fled for his life; he took his servant and went to Beersheba in Judah. Leaving the servant there, 
111Kg 19:4 Elijah walked a whole day into the wilderness. He stopped and sat down in the shade of a tree and wished he would die. "It's too much, LORD," he prayed. "Take away my life; I might as well be dead!" 
111Kg 19:5 He lay down under the tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said, "Wake up and eat." 
111Kg 19:6 He looked around and saw a loaf of bread and a jar of water near his head. He ate and drank, and lay down again. 
111Kg 19:7 The LORD's angel returned and woke him up a second time, saying, "Get up and eat, or the trip will be too much for you." 
111Kg 19:8 Elijah got up, ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to walk forty days to Sinai, the holy mountain. 
111Kg 19:9 There he went into a cave to spend the night. Suddenly the LORD spoke to him, "Elijah, what are you doing here?" 
111Kg 19:10 He answered, " LORD God Almighty, I have always served you - you alone. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed all your prophets. I am the only one left - and they are trying to kill me!" 
111Kg 19:11 "Go out and stand before me on top of the mountain," the LORD said to him. Then the LORD passed by and sent a furious wind that split the hills and shattered the rocks - but the LORD was not in the wind. The wind stopped blowing, and then there was an earthquake - but the LORD was not in the earthquake. 
111Kg 19:12 After the earthquake there was a fire - but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire there was the soft whisper of a voice. 
111Kg 19:13 When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. A voice said to him, "Elijah, what are you doing here?" 
111Kg 19:14 He answered, " LORD God Almighty, I have always served you - you alone. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed all your prophets. I am the only one left - and they are trying to kill me." 
111Kg 19:15 The LORD said, "Return to the wilderness near Damascus, then enter the city and anoint Hazael as king of Syria; 
111Kg 19:16 anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. 
111Kg 19:17 Anyone who escapes being put to death by Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and anyone who escapes Jehu will be killed by Elisha. 
111Kg 19:18 Yet I will leave seven thousand people alive in Israel - all those who are loyal to me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol." 
111Kg 19:19 Elijah left and found Elisha plowing with a team of oxen; there were eleven teams ahead of him, and he was plowing with the last one. Elijah took off his cloak and put it on Elisha. 
111Kg 19:20 Elisha then left his oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you." Elijah answered, "All right, go back. I'm not stopping you!" 
111Kg 19:21 Then Elisha went to his team of oxen, killed them, and cooked the meat, using the yoke as fuel for the fire. He gave the meat to the people, and they ate it. Then he went and followed Elijah as his helper. 
111Kg 20:1 King Benhadad of Syria gathered all his troops, and supported by thirty-two other rulers with their horses and chariots, he marched up, laid siege to Samaria, and launched attacks against it. 
111Kg 20:2 He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel to say, "King Benhadad demands that 
111Kg 20:3 you surrender to him your silver and gold, your women and the strongest of your children." 
111Kg 20:4 "Tell my lord, King Benhadad, that I agree; he can have me and everything I own," Ahab answered. 
111Kg 20:5 Later the messengers came back to Ahab with another demand from Benhadad�� "I sent you word that you were to hand over to me your silver and gold, your women and your children. 
111Kg 20:6 Now, however, I will send my officers to search your palace and the homes of your officials, and to take everything they consider valuable. They will be there about this time tomorrow." 
111Kg 20:7 King Ahab called in all the leaders of the country and said, "You see that this man wants to ruin us. He sent me a message demanding my wives and children, my silver and gold, and I agreed." 
111Kg 20:8 The leaders and the people answered, "Don't pay any attention to him; don't give in." 
111Kg 20:9 So Ahab replied to Benhadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king that I agreed to his first demand, but I cannot agree to the second." The messengers left and then returned with another message 
111Kg 20:10 from Benhadad�� "I will bring enough men to destroy this city of yours and carry off the rubble in their hands. May the gods strike me dead if I don't!" 
111Kg 20:11 King Ahab answered, "Tell King Benhadad that a real soldier does his bragging after a battle, not before it."
111Kg 20:12 Benhadad received Ahab's answer as he and his allies, the other rulers, were drinking in their tents. He ordered his men to get ready to attack the city, and so they moved into position. 
111Kg 20:13 Meanwhile, a prophet went to King Ahab and said, "The LORD says, 'Don't be afraid of that huge army! I will give you victory over it today, and you will know that I am the LORD.' " 
111Kg 20:14 "Who will lead the attack?" Ahab asked. The prophet answered, "The LORD says that the young soldiers under the command of the district governors are to do it." "Who will command the main force?" the king asked. "You," the prophet answered. 
111Kg 20:15 So the king called out the young soldiers who were under the district commanders, 232 in all. Then he called out the Israelite army, a total of seven thousand men. 
111Kg 20:16 The attack began at noon, as Benhadad and his thirty-two allies were getting drunk in their tents. 
111Kg 20:17 The young soldiers advanced first. Scouts sent out by Benhadad reported to him that a group of soldiers was coming out of Samaria. 
111Kg 20:18 He ordered, "Take them alive, no matter whether they are coming to fight or to ask for peace." 
111Kg 20:19 The young soldiers led the attack, followed by the Israelite army, 
111Kg 20:20 and each one killed the man he fought. The Syrians fled, with the Israelites in hot pursuit, but Benhadad escaped on horseback, accompanied by some of the cavalry. 
111Kg 20:21 King Ahab took to the field, captured the horses and chariots, and inflicted a severe defeat on the Syrians. 
111Kg 20:22 Then the prophet went to King Ahab and said, "Go back and build up your forces and make careful plans, because the king of Syria will attack again next spring." 
111Kg 20:23 King Benhadad's officials said to him, "The gods of Israel are mountain gods, and that is why the Israelites defeated us. But we will certainly defeat them if we fight them in the plains. 
111Kg 20:24 Now, remove the thirty-two rulers from their commands and replace them with field commanders. 
111Kg 20:25 Then call up an army as large as the one that deserted you, with the same number of horses and chariots. We will fight the Israelites in the plains, and this time we will defeat them." King Benhadad agreed and followed their advice. 
111Kg 20:26 The following spring he called up his men and marched with them to the city of Aphek to attack the Israelites. 
111Kg 20:27 The Israelites were called up and equipped; they marched out and camped in two groups facing the Syrians. The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats compared to the Syrians, who spread out over the countryside. 
111Kg 20:28 A prophet went to King Ahab and said, "This is what the LORD says�� 'Because the Syrians say that I am a god of the hills and not of the plains, I will give you victory over their huge army, and you and your people will know that I am the LORD.' " 
111Kg 20:29 For seven days the Syrians and the Israelites stayed in their camps, facing each other. On the seventh day they started fighting, and the Israelites killed a hundred thousand Syrians. 
111Kg 20:30 The survivors fled into the city of Aphek, where the city walls fell on twenty-seven thousand of them. Benhadad also escaped into the city and took refuge in the back room of a house. 
111Kg 20:31 His officials went to him and said, "We have heard that the Israelite kings are merciful. Give us permission to go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our necks, and maybe he will spare your life." 
111Kg 20:32 So they wrapped sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their necks, went to Ahab and said, "Your servant Benhadad pleads with you for his life." Ahab answered, "Is he still alive? Good! He's like a brother to me!" 
111Kg 20:33 Benhadad's officials were watching for a good sign, and when Ahab said "brother," they took it up at once, and said, "As you say, Benhadad is your brother!" "Bring him to me," Ahab ordered. When Benhadad arrived, Ahab invited him to get in the chariot with him. 
111Kg 20:34 Benhadad said to him, "I will restore to you the towns my father took from your father, and you may set up a commercial center for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria." Ahab replied, "On these terms, then, I will set you free." He made a treaty with him and let him go. 
111Kg 20:35 At the LORD's command a member of a group of prophets ordered a fellow prophet to hit him. But he refused, 
111Kg 20:36 so he said to him, "Because you have disobeyed the LORD's command, a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me." And as soon as he left, a lion came along and killed him. 
111Kg 20:37 Then this same prophet went to another man and said, "Hit me!" This man did so; he hit him a hard blow and hurt him. 
111Kg 20:38 The prophet bandaged his face with a cloth, to disguise himself, and went and stood by the road, waiting for the king of Israel to pass. 
111Kg 20:39 As the king was passing by, the prophet called out to him and said, "Your Majesty, I was fighting in the battle when a soldier brought a captured enemy to me and said, 'Guard this man; if he escapes, you will pay for it with your life or else pay a fine of three thousand pieces of silver.' 
111Kg 20:40 But I got busy with other things, and the man escaped." The king answered, "You have pronounced your own sentence, and you will have to pay the penalty." 
111Kg 20:41 The prophet tore the cloth from his face, and at once the king recognized him as one of the prophets. 
111Kg 20:42 The prophet then said to the king, "This is the word of the LORD�� 'Because you allowed the man to escape whom I had ordered to be killed, you will pay for it with your life, and your army will be destroyed for letting his army escape.' " 
111Kg 20:43 The king went back home to Samaria, worried and depressed. 
111Kg 21:1 Near King Ahab's palace in Jezreel there was a vineyard owned by a man named Naboth. 
111Kg 21:2 One day Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard; it is close to my palace, and I want to use the land for a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard for it or, if you prefer, I will pay you a fair price." 
111Kg 21:3 "I inherited this vineyard from my ancestors," Naboth replied. "The LORD forbid that I should let you have it!" 
111Kg 21:4 Ahab went home, depressed and angry over what Naboth had said to him. He lay down on his bed, facing the wall, and would not eat. 
111Kg 21:5 His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, "Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?" 
111Kg 21:6 He answered, "Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!" 
111Kg 21:7 "Well, are you the king or aren't you?" Jezebel replied. "Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!" 
111Kg 21:8 Then she wrote some letters, signed Ahab's name to them, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the officials and leading citizens of Jezreel. 
111Kg 21:9 The letters said�� "Proclaim a day of fasting, call the people together, and give Naboth the place of honor. 
111Kg 21:10 Get a couple of scoundrels to accuse him to his face of cursing God and the king. Then take him out of the city and stone him to death." 
111Kg 21:11 The officials and leading citizens of Jezreel did what Jezebel had commanded. 
111Kg 21:12 They proclaimed a day of fasting, called the people together, and gave Naboth the place of honor. 
111Kg 21:13 The two scoundrels publicly accused him of cursing God and the king, and so he was taken outside the city and stoned to death. 
111Kg 21:14 The message was sent to Jezebel�� "Naboth has been put to death." 
111Kg 21:15 As soon as Jezebel received the message, she said to Ahab, "Naboth is dead. Now go and take possession of the vineyard which he refused to sell to you." 
111Kg 21:16 At once Ahab went to the vineyard to take possession of it. 
111Kg 21:17 Then the LORD said to Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe, 
111Kg 21:18 "Go to King Ahab of Samaria. You will find him in Naboth's vineyard, about to take possession of it. 
111Kg 21:19 Tell him that I, the LORD, say to him, 'After murdering the man, are you taking over his property as well?' Tell him that this is what I say�� 'In the very place that the dogs licked up Naboth's blood they will lick up your blood!' " 
111Kg 21:20 When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, "Have you caught up with me, my enemy?" "Yes, I have," Elijah answered. "You have devoted yourself completely to doing what is wrong in the LORD's sight. 
111Kg 21:21 So the LORD says to you, 'I will bring disaster on you. I will do away with you and get rid of every male in your family, young and old alike. 
111Kg 21:22 Your family will become like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have stirred up my anger by leading Israel into sin.' 
111Kg 21:23 And concerning Jezebel, the LORD says that dogs will eat her body in the city of Jezreel. 
111Kg 21:24 Any of your relatives who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the open country will be eaten by vultures." 
111Kg 21:25 (There was no one else who had devoted himself so completely to doing wrong in the LORD's sight as Ahab - all at the urging of his wife Jezebel. 
111Kg 21:26 He committed the most shameful sins by worshiping idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD had driven out of the land as the people of Israel advanced.) 
111Kg 21:27 When Elijah finished speaking, Ahab tore his clothes, took them off, and put on sackcloth. He refused food, slept in the sackcloth, and went about gloomy and depressed. 
111Kg 21:28 The LORD said to the prophet Elijah, 
111Kg 21:29 "Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has done this, I will not bring disaster on him during his lifetime; it will be during his son's lifetime that I will bring disaster on Ahab's family." 
111Kg 22:1 There was peace between Israel and Syria for the next two years, 
111Kg 22:2 but in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to see King Ahab of Israel. 
111Kg 22:3 Ahab asked his officials, "Why is it that we have not done anything to get back Ramoth in Gilead from the king of Syria? It belongs to us!" 
111Kg 22:4 And Ahab asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?" "I am ready when you are," Jehoshaphat answered, "and so are my soldiers and my cavalry. 
111Kg 22:5 But first let's consult the LORD." 
111Kg 22:6 So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, "Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?" "Attack it," they answered. "The Lord will give you victory." 
111Kg 22:7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the LORD?" 
111Kg 22:8 Ahab answered, "There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad." "You shouldn't say that!" Jehoshaphat replied. 
111Kg 22:9 Then Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once. 
111Kg 22:10 The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
111Kg 22:11 One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, "This is what the LORD says�� 'With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.' " 
111Kg 22:12 All the other prophets said the same thing. "March against Ramoth and you will win," they said. "The LORD will give you victory." 
111Kg 22:13 Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, "All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same." 
111Kg 22:14 But Micaiah answered, "By the living LORD I promise that I will say what he tells me to!" 
111Kg 22:15 When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?" "Attack!" Micaiah answered. "Of course you'll win. The LORD will give you victory." 
111Kg 22:16 But Ahab replied, "When you speak to me in the name of the LORD, tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?" 
111Kg 22:17 Micaiah answered, "I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These men have no leader; let them go home in peace.' " 
111Kg 22:18 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me? It's always something bad!" 
111Kg 22:19 Micaiah went on�� "Now listen to what the LORD says! I saw the LORD sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him. 
111Kg 22:20 The LORD asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and be killed at Ramoth?' Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else, 
111Kg 22:21 until a spirit stepped forward, approached the LORD, and said, 'I will deceive him.' 
111Kg 22:22 'How?' the LORD asked. The spirit replied, 'I will go and make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.' The LORD said, 'Go and deceive him. You will succeed.' " 
111Kg 22:23 And Micaiah concluded�� "This is what has happened. The LORD has made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he himself has decreed that you will meet with disaster!" 
111Kg 22:24 Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, "Since when did the LORD's spirit leave me and speak to you?" 
111Kg 22:25 "You will find out when you go into some back room to hide," Micaiah replied. 
111Kg 22:26 Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, "Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash. 
111Kg 22:27 Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely." 
111Kg 22:28 "If you return safely," Micaiah exclaimed, "then the LORD has not spoken through me!" And he added, "Listen, everyone, to what I have said!" 
111Kg 22:29 Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
111Kg 22:30 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments." So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise. 
111Kg 22:31 The king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel. 
111Kg 22:32 So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But when he cried out, 
111Kg 22:33 they realized that he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped their attack. 
111Kg 22:34 By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. "I'm wounded!" he cried out to his chariot driver. "Turn around and pull out of the battle!" 
111Kg 22:35 While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. The blood from his wound ran down and covered the bottom of the chariot, and at evening he died. 
111Kg 22:36 Near sunset the order went out through the Israelite ranks�� "Each of you go back to your own country and city!" 
111Kg 22:37 So died King Ahab. His body was taken to Samaria and buried. 
111Kg 22:38 His chariot was cleaned up at the pool of Samaria, where dogs licked up his blood and prostitutes washed themselves, as the LORD had said would happen. 
111Kg 22:39 Everything else that King Ahab did, including an account of his palace decorated with ivory and of all the cities he built, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 22:40 At his death his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 22:41 In the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah 
111Kg 22:42 at the age of thirty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
111Kg 22:43 Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of the LORD; but the places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 
111Kg 22:44 Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
111Kg 22:45 Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, all his bravery and his battles, are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
111Kg 22:46 He got rid of all the male and female prostitutes serving at the pagan altars who were still left from the days of his father Asa. 
111Kg 22:47 The land of Edom had no king; it was ruled by a deputy appointed by the king of Judah. 
111Kg 22:48 King Jehoshaphat had ocean-going ships built to sail to the land of Ophir for gold; but they were wrecked at Eziongeber and never sailed. 
111Kg 22:49 Then King Ahaziah of Israel offered to let his men sail with Jehoshaphat's men, but Jehoshaphat refused the offer. 
111Kg 22:50 Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king. 
111Kg 22:51 In the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for two years. 
111Kg 22:52 He sinned against the LORD, following the wicked example of his father Ahab, his mother Jezebel, and King Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin. 
111Kg 22:53 He worshiped and served Baal, and like his father before him, he aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
12
122Kg 1:1 After the death of King Ahab of Israel the country of Moab rebelled against Israel. 
122Kg 1:2 King Ahaziah of Israel fell off the balcony on the roof of his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent some messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, in order to find out whether or not he would recover. 
122Kg 1:3 But an angel of the LORD commanded Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe, to go and meet the messengers of King Ahaziah and ask them, "Why are you going to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? 
122Kg 1:4 Tell the king that the LORD says, 'You will not recover from your injuries; you will die!' " Elijah did as the LORD commanded, 
122Kg 1:5 and the messengers returned to the king. "Why have you come back?" he asked. 
122Kg 1:6 They answered, "We were met by a man who told us to come back and tell you that the LORD says to you, 'Why are you sending messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? You will not recover from your injuries; you will die!' " 
122Kg 1:7 "What did the man look like?" the king asked. 
122Kg 1:8 "He was wearing a cloak made of animal skins, tied with a leather belt," they answered. "It's Elijah!" the king exclaimed. 
122Kg 1:9 Then he sent an officer with fifty men to get Elijah. The officer found him sitting on a hill and said to him, "Man of God, the king orders you to come down." 
122Kg 1:10 "If I am a man of God," Elijah answered, "may fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!" At once fire came down and killed the officer and his men. 
122Kg 1:11 The king sent another officer with fifty men, who went up and said to Elijah, "Man of God, the king orders you to come down at once!" 
122Kg 1:12 "If I am a man of God," Elijah answered, "may fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!" At once the fire of God came down and killed the officer and his men. 
122Kg 1:13 Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men. He went up the hill, fell on his knees in front of Elijah, and pleaded, "Man of God, be merciful to me and my men. Spare our lives! 
122Kg 1:14 The two other officers and their men were killed by fire from heaven; but please be merciful to me!" 
122Kg 1:15 The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him, and don't be afraid." So Elijah went with the officer to the king 
122Kg 1:16 and said to him, "This is what the LORD says�� 'Because you sent messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron - as if there were no god in Israel to consult - you will not get well; you will die!' " 
122Kg 1:17 Ahaziah died, as the LORD had said through Elijah. Ahaziah had no sons, so his brother Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. 
122Kg 1:18 Everything else that King Ahaziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 2:1 The time came for the LORD to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal, 
122Kg 2:2 and on the way Elijah said to Elisha, "Now stay here; the LORD has ordered me to go to Bethel." But Elisha answered, "I swear by my loyalty to the living LORD and to you that I will not leave you." So they went on to Bethel. 
122Kg 2:3 A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha answered. "But let's not talk about it." 
122Kg 2:4 Then Elijah said to Elisha, "Now stay here; the LORD has ordered me to go to Jericho." But Elisha answered, "I swear by my loyalty to the living LORD and to you that I will not leave you." So they went on to Jericho. 
122Kg 2:5 A group of prophets who lived there went to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha answered. "But let's not talk about it." 
122Kg 2:6 Then Elijah said to Elisha, "Now stay here; the LORD has ordered me to go to the Jordan River." But Elisha answered, "I swear by my loyalty to the living LORD and to you that I will not leave you." So they went on, 
122Kg 2:7 and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan. Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river, and the fifty prophets stood a short distance away. 
122Kg 2:8 Then Elijah took off his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it; the water divided, and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground. 
122Kg 2:9 There, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken away." "Let me receive the share of your power that will make me your successor," Elisha answered. 
122Kg 2:10 "That is a difficult request to grant," Elijah replied. "But you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you; if you don't see me, you won't receive it." 
122Kg 2:11 They kept talking as they walked on; then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them, and Elijah was taken up to heaven by a whirlwind. 
122Kg 2:12 Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah, "My father, my father! Mighty defender of Israel! You are gone!" And he never saw Elijah again. In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two. 
122Kg 2:13 Then he picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
122Kg 2:14 He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" Then he struck the water again, and it divided, and he walked over to the other side. 
122Kg 2:15 The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said, "The power of Elijah is on Elisha!" They went to meet him, bowed down before him, 
122Kg 2:16 and said, "There are fifty of us here, all strong men. Let us go and look for your master. Maybe the spirit of the LORD has carried him away and left him on some mountain or in some valley." "No, you must not go," Elisha answered. 
122Kg 2:17 But they insisted until he gave in and let them go. The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days, but didn't find him. 
122Kg 2:18 Then they returned to Elisha, who had waited at Jericho, and he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?" 
122Kg 2:19 Some men from Jericho went to Elisha and said, "As you know, sir, this is a fine city, but the water is bad and causes miscarriages." 
122Kg 2:20 "Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me," he ordered. They brought it to him, 
122Kg 2:21 and he went to the spring, threw the salt in the water, and said, "This is what the LORD says�� 'I make this water pure, and it will not cause any more deaths or miscarriages.' " 
122Kg 2:22 And that water has been pure ever since, just as Elisha said it would be. 
122Kg 2:23 Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel, and on the way some boys came out of a town and made fun of him. "Get out of here, baldy!" they shouted. 
122Kg 2:24 Elisha turned around, glared at them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces. 
122Kg 2:25 Elisha went on to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria. 
122Kg 3:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twelve years. 
122Kg 3:2 He sinned against the LORD, but he was not as bad as his father or his mother Jezebel; he pulled down the image his father had made for the worship of Baal. 
122Kg 3:3 Yet, like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him, he led Israel into sin and would not stop. 
122Kg 3:4 King Mesha of Moab raised sheep, and every year he gave as tribute to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 sheep. 
122Kg 3:5 But when King Ahab of Israel died, Mesha rebelled against Israel. 
122Kg 3:6 At once King Joram left Samaria and gathered all his troops. 
122Kg 3:7 He sent word to King Jehoshaphat of Judah�� "The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you join me in war against him?" "I will," King Jehoshaphat replied. "I am at your disposal, and so are my men and my horses. 
122Kg 3:8 What route shall we take for the attack?" "We will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom," Joram answered. 
122Kg 3:9 So King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom set out. After marching seven days, they ran out of water, and there was none left for the men or the pack animals. 
122Kg 3:10 "We're done for!" King Joram exclaimed. "The LORD has put the three of us at the mercy of the king of Moab!" 
122Kg 3:11 King Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there a prophet here through whom we can consult the LORD?" An officer of King Joram's forces answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was Elijah's assistant." 
122Kg 3:12 "He is a true prophet," King Jehoshaphat said. So the three kings went to Elisha. 
122Kg 3:13 "Why should I help you?" Elisha said to the king of Israel. "Go and consult those prophets that your father and mother consulted." "No!" Joram replied. "It is the LORD who has put us three kings at the mercy of the king of Moab." 
122Kg 3:14 Elisha answered, "By the living LORD, whom I serve, I swear that I would have nothing to do with you if I didn't respect your ally, King Jehoshaphat of Judah. 
122Kg 3:15 Now get me a musician." As the musician played his harp, the power of the LORD came on Elisha, 
122Kg 3:16 and he said, "This is what the LORD says�� 'Dig ditches all over this dry stream bed. 
122Kg 3:17 Even though you will not see any rain or wind, this stream bed will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your pack animals will have plenty to drink.' " 
122Kg 3:18 And Elisha continued, "But this is an easy thing for the LORD to do; he will also give you victory over the Moabites. 
122Kg 3:19 You will conquer all their beautiful fortified cities; you will cut down all their fruit trees, stop all their springs, and ruin all their fertile fields by covering them with stones." 
122Kg 3:20 The next morning, at the time of the regular morning sacrifice, water came flowing from the direction of Edom and covered the ground. 
122Kg 3:21 When the Moabites heard that the three kings had come to attack them, all the men who could bear arms, from the oldest to the youngest, were called out and stationed at the border. 
122Kg 3:22 When they got up the following morning, the sun was shining on the water, making it look as red as blood. 
122Kg 3:23 "It's blood!" they exclaimed. "The three enemy armies must have fought and killed each other! Let's go and loot their camp!" 
122Kg 3:24 But when they reached the camp, the Israelites attacked them and drove them back. The Israelites kept up the pursuit, slaughtering the Moabites 
122Kg 3:25 and destroying their cities. As they passed by a fertile field, every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered; they also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees. At last only the capital city of Kir Heres was left, and the slingers surrounded it and attacked it. 
122Kg 3:26 When the king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Syria, but he failed. 
122Kg 3:27 So he took his oldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him on the city wall as a sacrifice to the god of Moab. The Israelites were terrified and so they drew back from the city and returned to their own country. 
122Kg 4:1 The widow of a member of a group of prophets went to Elisha and said, "Sir, my husband has died! As you know, he was a God-fearing man, but now a man he owed money to has come to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt." 
122Kg 4:2 "What shall I do for you?" he asked. "Tell me, what do you have at home?" "Nothing at all, except a small jar of olive oil," she answered. 
122Kg 4:3 "Go to your neighbors and borrow as many empty jars as you can," Elisha told her. 
122Kg 4:4 "Then you and your sons go into the house, close the door, and start pouring oil into the jars. Set each one aside as soon as it is full." 
122Kg 4:5 So the woman went into her house with her sons, closed the door, took the small jar of olive oil, and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her. 
122Kg 4:6 When they had filled all the jars, she asked if there were any more. "That was the last one," one of her sons answered. And the olive oil stopped flowing. 
122Kg 4:7 She went back to Elisha, the prophet, who said to her, "Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts, and there will be enough money left over for you and your sons to live on." 
122Kg 4:8 One day Elisha went to Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She invited him to a meal, and from then on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house. 
122Kg 4:9 She said to her husband, "I am sure that this man who comes here so often is a holy man. 
122Kg 4:10 Let's build a small room on the roof, put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in it, and he can stay there whenever he visits us." 
122Kg 4:11 One day Elisha returned to Shunem and went up to his room to rest. 
122Kg 4:12 He told his servant Gehazi to go and call the woman. When she came, 
122Kg 4:13 he said to Gehazi, "Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs. Maybe she would like me to go to the king or the army commander and put in a good word for her." "I have all I need here among my own people," she answered. 
122Kg 4:14 Elisha asked Gehazi, "What can I do for her then?" He answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is an old man." 
122Kg 4:15 "Tell her to come here," Elisha ordered. She came and stood in the doorway, 
122Kg 4:16 and Elisha said to her, "By this time next year you will be holding a son in your arms." "Oh!" she exclaimed. "Please, sir, don't lie to me. You are a man of God!" 
122Kg 4:17 But, as Elisha had said, at about that time the following year she gave birth to a son. 
122Kg 4:18 Some years later, at harvest time, the boy went out one morning to join his father, who was in the field with the harvest workers. 
122Kg 4:19 Suddenly he cried out to his father, "My head hurts! My head hurts!" "Carry the boy to his mother," the father said to a servant. 
122Kg 4:20 The servant carried the boy back to his mother, who held him in her lap until noon, at which time he died. 
122Kg 4:21 She carried him up to Elisha's room, put him on the bed and left, closing the door behind her. 
122Kg 4:22 Then she called her husband and said to him, "Send a servant here with a donkey. I need to go to the prophet Elisha. I'll be back as soon as I can." 
122Kg 4:23 "Why do you have to go today?" her husband asked. "It's neither a Sabbath nor a New Moon Festival." "Never mind," she answered. 
122Kg 4:24 Then she had the donkey saddled, and ordered the servant, "Make the donkey go as fast as it can, and don't slow down unless I tell you to." 
122Kg 4:25 So she set out and went to Mount Carmel, where Elisha was. Elisha saw her coming while she was still some distance away, and he said to his servant Gehazi, "Look, there comes the woman from Shunem! 
122Kg 4:26 Hurry to her and find out if everything is all right with her, her husband, and her son." She told Gehazi that everything was all right, 
122Kg 4:27 but when she came to Elisha, she bowed down before him and took hold of his feet. Gehazi was about to push her away, but Elisha said, "Leave her alone. Can't you see she's deeply distressed? And the LORD has not told me a thing about it." 
122Kg 4:28 The woman said to him, "Sir, did I ask you for a son? Didn't I tell you not to get my hopes up?" 
122Kg 4:29 Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, "Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy." 
122Kg 4:30 The woman said to Elisha, "I swear by my loyalty to the living LORD and to you that I will not leave you!" So the two of them started back together. 
122Kg 4:31 Gehazi went on ahead and held Elisha's stick over the child, but there was no sound or any other sign of life. So he went back to meet Elisha and said, "The boy didn't wake up." 
122Kg 4:32 When Elisha arrived, he went alone into the room and saw the boy lying dead on the bed. 
122Kg 4:33 He closed the door and prayed to the LORD. 
122Kg 4:34 Then he lay down on the boy, placing his mouth, eyes, and hands on the boy's mouth, eyes, and hands. As he lay stretched out over the boy, the boy's body started to get warm. 
122Kg 4:35 Elisha got up, walked around the room, and then went back and again stretched himself over the boy. The boy sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes. 
122Kg 4:36 Elisha called Gehazi and told him to call the boy's mother. When she came in, he said to her, "Here's your son." 
122Kg 4:37 She fell at Elisha's feet, with her face touching the ground; then she took her son and left. 
122Kg 4:38 Once, when there was a famine throughout the land, Elisha returned to Gilgal. While he was teaching a group of prophets, he told his servant to put a big pot on the fire and make some stew for them. 
122Kg 4:39 One of them went out in the fields to get some herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry. He brought them back and sliced them up into the stew, not knowing what they were. 
122Kg 4:40 The stew was poured out for the men to eat, but as soon as they tasted it they exclaimed to Elisha, "It's poisoned!" - and wouldn't eat it. 
122Kg 4:41 Elisha asked for some meal, threw it into the pot, and said, "Pour out some more stew for them." And then there was nothing wrong with it. 
122Kg 4:42 Another time, a man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year, and some freshly-cut heads of grain. Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this, 
122Kg 4:43 but he answered, "Do you think this is enough for a hundred men?" Elisha replied, "Give it to them to eat, because the LORD says that they will eat and still have some left over." 
122Kg 4:44 So the servant set the food before them, and as the LORD had said, they all ate, and there was still some left over. 
122Kg 5:1 Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, was highly respected and esteemed by the king of Syria, because through Naaman the LORD had given victory to the Syrian forces. He was a great soldier, but he suffered from a dreaded skin disease. 
122Kg 5:2 In one of their raids against Israel, the Syrians had carried off a little Israelite girl, who became a servant of Naaman's wife. 
122Kg 5:3 One day she said to her mistress, "I wish that my master could go to the prophet who lives in Samaria! He would cure him of his disease." 
122Kg 5:4 When Naaman heard of this, he went to the king and told him what the girl had said. 
122Kg 5:5 The king said, "Go to the king of Israel and take this letter to him." So Naaman set out, taking thirty thousand pieces of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of fine clothes. 
122Kg 5:6 The letter that he took read�� "This letter will introduce my officer Naaman. I want you to cure him of his disease." 
122Kg 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and exclaimed, "How can the king of Syria expect me to cure this man? Does he think that I am God, with the power of life and death? It's plain that he is trying to start a quarrel with me!" 
122Kg 5:8 When the prophet Elisha heard what had happened, he sent word to the king�� "Why are you so upset? Send the man to me, and I'll show him that there is a prophet in Israel!" 
122Kg 5:9 So Naaman went with his horses and chariot and stopped at the entrance to Elisha's house. 
122Kg 5:10 Elisha sent a servant out to tell him to go and wash himself seven times in the Jordan River, and he would be completely cured of his disease. 
122Kg 5:11 But Naaman left in a rage, saying, "I thought that he would at least come out to me, pray to the LORD his God, wave his hand over the diseased spot, and cure me! 
122Kg 5:12 Besides, aren't the rivers Abana and Pharpar, back in Damascus, better than any river in Israel? I could have washed in them and been cured!" 
122Kg 5:13 His servants went up to him and said, "Sir, if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. Now why can't you just wash yourself, as he said, and be cured?" 
122Kg 5:14 So Naaman went down to the Jordan, dipped himself in it seven times, as Elisha had instructed, and he was completely cured. His flesh became firm and healthy like that of a child. 
122Kg 5:15 He returned to Elisha with all his men and said, "Now I know that there is no god but the God of Israel; so please, sir, accept a gift from me." 
122Kg 5:16 Elisha answered, "By the living LORD, whom I serve, I swear that I will not accept a gift." Naaman insisted that he accept it, but he would not. 
122Kg 5:17 So Naaman said, "If you won't accept my gift, then let me have two mule-loads of earth to take home with me, because from now on I will not offer sacrifices or burnt offerings to any god except the LORD. 
122Kg 5:18 So I hope that the LORD will forgive me when I accompany my king to the temple of Rimmon, the god of Syria, and worship him. Surely the LORD will forgive me!" 
122Kg 5:19 "Go in peace," Elisha said. And Naaman left. He had gone only a short distance, 
122Kg 5:20 when Elisha's servant Gehazi said to himself, "My master has let Naaman get away without paying a thing! He should have accepted what that Syrian offered him. By the living LORD I will run after him and get something from him." 
122Kg 5:21 So he set off after Naaman. When Naaman saw a man running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him, and asked, "Is something wrong?" 
122Kg 5:22 "No," Gehazi answered. "But my master sent me to tell you that just now two members of the group of prophets in the hill country of Ephraim arrived, and he would like you to give them three thousand pieces of silver and two changes of fine clothes." 
122Kg 5:23 "Please take six thousand pieces of silver," Naaman replied. He insisted on it, tied up the silver in two bags, gave them and two changes of fine clothes to two of his servants, and sent them on ahead of Gehazi. 
122Kg 5:24 When they reached the hill where Elisha lived, Gehazi took the two bags and carried them into the house. Then he sent Naaman's servants back. 
122Kg 5:25 He went back into the house, and Elisha asked him, "Where have you been?" "Oh, nowhere, sir," he answered. 
122Kg 5:26 But Elisha said, "Wasn't I there in spirit when the man got out of his chariot to meet you? This is no time to accept money and clothes, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, or servants! 
122Kg 5:27 And now Naaman's disease will come upon you, and you and your descendants will have it forever!" When Gehazi left, he had the disease - his skin was as white as snow. 
122Kg 6:1 One day the group of prophets that Elisha was in charge of complained to him, "The place where we live is too small! 
122Kg 6:2 Give us permission to go to the Jordan and cut down some trees, so that we can build a place to live." "All right," Elisha answered. 
122Kg 6:3 One of them urged him to go with them; he agreed, 
122Kg 6:4 and they set out together. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began to work. 
122Kg 6:5 As one of them was cutting down a tree, suddenly his iron ax head fell in the water. "What shall I do, sir?" he exclaimed to Elisha. "It was a borrowed ax!" 
122Kg 6:6 "Where did it fall?" Elisha asked. The man showed him the place, and Elisha cut off a stick, threw it in the water, and made the ax head float. 
122Kg 6:7 "Take it out," he ordered, and the man reached down and picked it up. 
122Kg 6:8 The king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his officers and chose a place to set up his camp. 
122Kg 6:9 But Elisha sent word to the king of Israel, warning him not to go near that place, because the Syrians were waiting in ambush there. 
122Kg 6:10 So the king of Israel warned the people who lived in that place, and they were on guard. This happened several times. 
122Kg 6:11 The Syrian king became greatly upset over this; he called in his officers and asked them, "Which one of you is on the side of the king of Israel?" 
122Kg 6:12 One of them answered, "No one is, Your Majesty. The prophet Elisha tells the king of Israel what you say even in the privacy of your own room." 
122Kg 6:13 "Find out where he is," the king ordered, "and I will capture him." When he was told that Elisha was in Dothan, 
122Kg 6:14 he sent a large force there with horses and chariots. They reached the town at night and surrounded it. 
122Kg 6:15 Early the next morning Elisha's servant got up, went out of the house, and saw the Syrian troops with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. He went back to Elisha and exclaimed, "We are doomed, sir! What shall we do?" 
122Kg 6:16 "Don't be afraid," Elisha answered. "We have more on our side than they have on theirs." 
122Kg 6:17 Then he prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes and let him see!" The LORD answered his prayer, and Elisha's servant looked up and saw the hillside covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 
122Kg 6:18 When the Syrians attacked, Elisha prayed, "O LORD, strike these men blind!" The LORD answered his prayer and struck them blind. 
122Kg 6:19 Then Elisha went to them and said, "You are on the wrong road; this is not the town you are looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are after." And he led them to Samaria. 
122Kg 6:20 As soon as they had entered the city, Elisha prayed, "Open their eyes, LORD, and let them see." The LORD answered his prayer; he restored their sight, and they saw that they were inside Samaria. 
122Kg 6:21 When the king of Israel saw the Syrians, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, sir? Shall I kill them?" 
122Kg 6:22 "No," he answered. "Not even soldiers you had captured in combat would you put to death. Give them something to eat and drink, and let them return to their king." 
122Kg 6:23 So the king of Israel provided a great feast for them; and after they had eaten and drunk, he sent them back to the king of Syria. From then on the Syrians stopped raiding the land of Israel. 
122Kg 6:24 Some time later King Benhadad of Syria led his entire army against Israel and laid siege to the city of Samaria. 
122Kg 6:25 As a result of the siege the food shortage in the city was so severe that a donkey's head cost eighty pieces of silver, and half a pound of dove's dung cost five pieces of silver. 
122Kg 6:26 The king of Israel was walking by on the city wall when a woman cried out, "Help me, Your Majesty!" 
122Kg 6:27 He replied, "If the LORD won't help you, what help can I provide? Do I have any wheat or wine? 
122Kg 6:28 What's your trouble?" She answered, "The other day this woman here suggested that we eat my child, and then eat her child the next day. 
122Kg 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I told her that we would eat her son, but she had hidden him!" 
122Kg 6:30 Hearing this, the king tore his clothes in dismay, and the people who were close to the wall could see that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes. 
122Kg 6:31 He exclaimed, "May God strike me dead if Elisha is not beheaded before the day is over!" 
122Kg 6:32 And he sent a messenger to get Elisha. Meanwhile Elisha was at home with some elders who were visiting him. Before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "That murderer is sending someone to kill me! Now, when he gets here, shut the door and don't let him come in. The king himself will be right behind him." 
122Kg 6:33 He had hardly finished saying this, when the king arrived and said, "It's the LORD who has brought this trouble on us! Why should I wait any longer for him to do something?" 
122Kg 7:1 Elisha answered, "Listen to what the LORD says! By this time tomorrow you will be able to buy in Samaria ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley for one piece of silver." 
122Kg 7:2 The personal attendant of the king said to Elisha, "That can't happen - not even if the LORD himself were to send grain at once!" "You will see it happen, but you won't get to eat any of the food," Elisha replied. 
122Kg 7:3 Four men who were suffering from a dreaded skin disease were outside the gates of Samaria, and they said to each other, "Why should we wait here until we die? 
122Kg 7:4 It's no use going into the city, because we would starve to death in there; but if we stay here, we'll die also. So let's go to the Syrian camp; the worst they can do is kill us, but maybe they will spare our lives." 
122Kg 7:5 So, as it began to get dark, they went to the Syrian camp, but when they reached it, no one was there. 
122Kg 7:6 The Lord had made the Syrians hear what sounded like the advance of a large army with horses and chariots, and the Syrians thought that the king of Israel had hired Hittite and Egyptian kings and their armies to attack them. 
122Kg 7:7 So that evening the Syrians had fled for their lives, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys, and leaving the camp just as it was. 
122Kg 7:8 When the four men reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, ate and drank what was there, grabbed the silver, gold, and clothing they found, and went off and hid them; then they returned, entered another tent, and did the same thing. 
122Kg 7:9 But then they said to each other, "We shouldn't be doing this! We have good news, and we shouldn't keep it to ourselves. If we wait until morning to tell it, we are sure to be punished. Let's go right now and tell the king's officers!" 
122Kg 7:10 So they left the Syrian camp, went back to Samaria, and called out to the guards at the gates�� "We went to the Syrian camp and didn't see or hear anybody; the horses and donkeys have not been untied, and the tents are just as the Syrians left them." 
122Kg 7:11 The guards announced the news, and it was reported in the palace. 
122Kg 7:12 It was still night, but the king got out of bed and said to his officials, "I'll tell you what the Syrians are planning! They know about the famine here, so they have left their camp to go and hide in the countryside. They think that we will leave the city to find food, and then they will take us alive and capture the city." 
122Kg 7:13 One of his officials said, "The people here in the city are doomed anyway, like those that have already died. So let's send some men with five of the horses that are left, so that we can find out what has happened." 
122Kg 7:14 They chose some men, and the king sent them in two chariots with instructions to go and find out what had happened to the Syrian army. 
122Kg 7:15 The men went as far as the Jordan, and all along the road they saw the clothes and equipment that the Syrians had abandoned as they fled. Then they returned and reported to the king. 
122Kg 7:16 The people of Samaria rushed out and looted the Syrian camp. And as the LORD had said, ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley were sold for one piece of silver. 
122Kg 7:17 It so happened that the king of Israel had put the city gate under the command of the officer who was his personal attendant. The officer was trampled to death there by the people and died, as Elisha had predicted when the king went to see him. 
122Kg 7:18 Elisha had told the king that by that time the following day ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley would be sold in Samaria for one piece of silver, 
122Kg 7:19 to which the officer had answered, "That can't happen - not even if the LORD himself were to send grain at once!" And Elisha had replied, "You will see it happen, but you won't get to eat any of the food." 
122Kg 7:20 And that is just what happened to him - he died, trampled to death by the people at the city gate. 
122Kg 8:1 Now Elisha had told the woman who lived in Shunem, whose son he had brought back to life, that the LORD was sending a famine on the land, which would last for seven years, and that she should leave with her family and go and live somewhere else. 
122Kg 8:2 She had followed his instructions and had gone with her family to live in Philistia for the seven years. 
122Kg 8:3 At the end of the seven years she returned to Israel and went to the king to ask that her house and her land be restored to her. 
122Kg 8:4 She found the king talking with Gehazi, Elisha's servant; the king wanted to know about Elisha's miracles. 
122Kg 8:5 While Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life, the woman made her appeal to the king. Gehazi said to him, "Your Majesty, here is the woman and here is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!" 
122Kg 8:6 In answer to the king's question, she confirmed Gehazi's story, and so the king called an official and told him to give back to her everything that was hers, including the value of all the crops that her fields had produced during the seven years she had been away. 
122Kg 8:7 Elisha went to Damascus at a time when King Benhadad of Syria was sick. When the king was told that Elisha was there, 
122Kg 8:8 he said to Hazael, one of his officials, "Take a gift to the prophet and ask him to consult the LORD to find out whether or not I am going to get well." 
122Kg 8:9 So Hazael loaded forty camels with all kinds of the finest products of Damascus and went to Elisha. When Hazael met him, he said, "Your servant King Benhadad has sent me to ask you whether or not he will recover from his sickness." 
122Kg 8:10 Elisha answered, "The LORD has revealed to me that he will die; but go to him and tell him that he will recover." 
122Kg 8:11 Then Elisha stared at him with a horrified look on his face until Hazael became ill at ease. Suddenly Elisha burst into tears. 
122Kg 8:12 "Why are you crying, sir?" Hazael asked. "Because I know the horrible things you will do against the people of Israel," Elisha answered. "You will set their fortresses on fire, slaughter their finest young men, batter their children to death, and rip open their pregnant women." 
122Kg 8:13 "How could I ever be that powerful?" Hazael asked. "I'm a nobody!" "The LORD has shown me that you will be king of Syria," Elisha replied. 
122Kg 8:14 Hazael went back to Benhadad, who asked him, "What did Elisha say?" "He told me that you would certainly get well," Hazael answered. 
122Kg 8:15 But on the following day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and smothered the king. And Hazael succeeded Benhadad as king of Syria. 
122Kg 8:16 In the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah 
122Kg 8:17 at the age of thirty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. 
122Kg 8:18 His wife was Ahab's daughter, and like the family of Ahab he followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel. He sinned against the LORD, 
122Kg 8:19 but the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, because he had promised his servant David that his descendants would always continue to rule. 
122Kg 8:20 During Jehoram's reign Edom revolted against Judah and became an independent kingdom. 
122Kg 8:21 So Jehoram set out with all his chariots to Zair, where the Edomite army surrounded them. During the night he and his chariot commanders managed to break out and escape, and his soldiers scattered to their homes. 
122Kg 8:22 Edom has been independent of Judah ever since. During this same period the city of Libnah also revolted. 
122Kg 8:23 Everything else that Jehoram did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 8:24 Jehoram died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Ahaziah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 8:25 In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah 
122Kg 8:26 at the age of twenty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother was Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 
122Kg 8:27 Since Ahaziah was related to King Ahab by marriage, he sinned against the LORD, just as Ahab's family did. 
122Kg 8:28 King Ahaziah joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle. 
122Kg 8:29 He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds, and Ahaziah went there to visit him. 
122Kg 9:1 Meanwhile the prophet Elisha called one of the young prophets and said to him, "Get ready and go to Ramoth in Gilead. Take this jar of olive oil with you, 
122Kg 9:2 and when you get there look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a private room away from his companions, 
122Kg 9:3 pour this olive oil on his head, and say, 'The LORD proclaims that he anoints you king of Israel.' Then leave there as fast as you can." 
122Kg 9:4 So the young prophet went to Ramoth, 
122Kg 9:5 where he found the army officers in a conference. He said, "Sir, I have a message for you." Jehu asked, "Which one of us are you speaking to?" "To you, sir," he replied. 
122Kg 9:6 Then the two of them went indoors, and the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, proclaims�� 'I anoint you king of my people Israel. 
122Kg 9:7 You are to kill your master the king, that son of Ahab, so that I may punish Jezebel for murdering my prophets and my other servants. 
122Kg 9:8 All of Ahab's family and descendants are to die; I will get rid of every male in his family, young and old alike. 
122Kg 9:9 I will treat his family as I did the families of King Jeroboam of Israel and of King Baasha of Israel. 
122Kg 9:10 Jezebel will not be buried; her body will be eaten by dogs in the territory of Jezreel.' " After saying this, the young prophet left the room and fled. 
122Kg 9:11 Jehu went back to his fellow officers, who asked him, "Is everything all right? What did that crazy fellow want with you?" "You know what he wanted," Jehu answered. 
122Kg 9:12 "No we don't!" they replied. "Tell us what he said!" "He told me that the LORD proclaims�� 'I anoint you king of Israel.' " 
122Kg 9:13 At once Jehu's fellow officers spread their cloaks at the top of the steps for Jehu to stand on, blew trumpets, and shouted, "Jehu is king!" 
122Kg 9:14 Then Jehu plotted against King Joram, who was in Jezreel, where he had gone to recover from the wounds which he had received in the battle at Ramoth against King Hazael of Syria. 
122Kg 9:15 So Jehu said to his fellow officers, "If you are with me, make sure that no one slips out of Ramoth to go and warn the people in Jezreel." 
122Kg 9:16 Then he got into his chariot and set off for Jezreel. Joram had still not recovered, and King Ahaziah of Judah was there, visiting him. 
122Kg 9:17 A guard on duty in the watchtower at Jezreel saw Jehu and his men approaching. "I see some men riding up!" he called out. Joram replied, "Send a rider to find out if they are friends or enemies." 
122Kg 9:18 The messenger rode out to Jehu and said to him, "The king wants to know if you come as a friend." "That's none of your business!" Jehu answered. "Fall in behind me." The guard on the watchtower reported that the messenger had reached the group but was not returning. 
122Kg 9:19 Another messenger was sent out, who asked Jehu the same question. Again Jehu answered, "That's none of your business! Fall in behind me." 
122Kg 9:20 Once more the guard reported that the messenger had reached the group but was not returning. And he added, "The leader of the group is driving his chariot like a madman, just like Jehu!" 
122Kg 9:21 "Get my chariot ready," King Joram ordered. It was done, and he and King Ahaziah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the field which had belonged to Naboth. 
122Kg 9:22 "Are you coming in peace?" Joram asked him. "How can there be peace," Jehu answered, "when we still have all the witchcraft and idolatry that your mother Jezebel started?" 
122Kg 9:23 "It's treason, Ahaziah!" Joram cried out, as he turned his chariot around and fled. 
122Kg 9:24 Jehu drew his bow, and with all his strength shot an arrow that struck Joram in the back and pierced his heart. Joram fell dead in his chariot, 
122Kg 9:25 and Jehu said to his aide Bidkar, "Get his body and throw it in the field that belonged to Naboth. Remember that when you and I were riding together behind King Joram's father Ahab, the LORD spoke these words against Ahab��
122Kg 9:26 'I saw the murder of Naboth and his sons yesterday. And I promise that I will punish you here in this same field.' So take Joram's body," Jehu ordered his aide, "and throw it in the field that belonged to Naboth, so as to fulfill the LORD's promise." 
122Kg 9:27 King Ahaziah saw what happened, so he fled in his chariot toward the town of Beth Haggan, pursued by Jehu. "Kill him too!" Jehu ordered his men, and they wounded him as he drove his chariot on the road up to Gur, near the town of Ibleam. But he managed to keep on going until he reached the city of Megiddo, where he died. 
122Kg 9:28 His officials took his body back to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in the royal tombs in David's City. 
122Kg 9:29 Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year that Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel. 
122Kg 9:30 Jehu arrived in Jezreel. Jezebel, having heard what had happened, put on eye shadow, arranged her hair, and stood looking down at the street from a window in the palace. 
122Kg 9:31 As Jehu came through the gate, she called out, "You Zimri! You assassin! Why are you here?" 
122Kg 9:32 Jehu looked up and shouted, "Who is on my side?" Two or three palace officials looked down at him from a window, 
122Kg 9:33 and Jehu said to them, "Throw her down!" They threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses. Jehu drove his horses and chariot over her body, 
122Kg 9:34 entered the palace, and had a meal. Only then did he say, "Take that cursed woman and bury her; after all, she is a king's daughter." 
122Kg 9:35 But the men who went out to bury her found nothing except her skull and the bones of her hands and feet. 
122Kg 9:36 When they reported this to Jehu, he said, "This is what the LORD said would happen, when he spoke through his servant Elijah�� 'Dogs will eat Jezebel's body in the territory of Jezreel. 
122Kg 9:37 Her remains will be scattered there like dung, so that no one will be able to identify them.' " 
122Kg 10:1 There were seventy descendants of King Ahab living in the city of Samaria. Jehu wrote a letter and sent copies to the rulers of the city, to the leading citizens, and to the guardians of Ahab's descendants. The letter read��
122Kg 10:2 "You are in charge of the king's descendants, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, weapons, and fortified cities. So then, as soon as you receive this letter, 
122Kg 10:3 you are to choose the best qualified of the king's descendants, make him king, and fight to defend him." 
122Kg 10:4 The rulers of Samaria were terrified. "How can we oppose Jehu," they said, "when neither King Joram nor King Ahaziah could?" 
122Kg 10:5 So the officer in charge of the palace and the official in charge of the city, together with the leading citizens and the guardians, sent this message to Jehu�� "We are your servants, and we are ready to do anything you say. But we will not make anyone king; do whatever you think best." 
122Kg 10:6 Jehu wrote them another letter�� "If you are with me and are ready to follow my orders, bring the heads of King Ahab's descendants to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow." The seventy descendants of King Ahab were under the care of the leading citizens of Samaria, who were bringing them up. 
122Kg 10:7 When Jehu's letter was received, the leaders of Samaria killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 
122Kg 10:8 When Jehu was told that the heads of Ahab's descendants had been brought, he ordered them to be piled up in two heaps at the city gate and to be left there until the following morning. 
122Kg 10:9 In the morning he went out to the gate and said to the people who were there, "I was the one who plotted against King Joram and killed him; you are not responsible for that. But who killed all these? 
122Kg 10:10 This proves that everything that the LORD said about the descendants of Ahab will come true. The LORD has done what he promised through his prophet Elijah." 
122Kg 10:11 Then Jehu put to death all the other relatives of Ahab living in Jezreel, and all his officers, close friends, and priests; not one of them was left alive. 
122Kg 10:12 Jehu left Jezreel to go to Samaria. On the way, at a place called "Shepherds' Camp," 
122Kg 10:13 he met some relatives of the late King Ahaziah of Judah and asked them, "Who are you?" "Ahaziah's relatives," they answered. "We are going to Jezreel to pay our respects to the children of Queen Jezebel and to the rest of the royal family." 
122Kg 10:14 Jehu ordered his men, "Take them alive!" They seized them, and he put them to death near a pit there. There were forty-two people in all, and not one of them was left alive. 
122Kg 10:15 Jehu started out again, and on his way he was met by Jonadab son of Rechab. Jehu greeted him and said, "You and I think alike. Will you support me?" "I will," Jonadab answered. "Give me your hand, then," Jehu replied. They clasped hands, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot, 
122Kg 10:16 saying, "Come with me and see for yourself how devoted I am to the LORD." And they rode on together to Samaria. 
122Kg 10:17 When they arrived there, Jehu killed all of Ahab's relatives, not sparing even one. This is what the LORD had told Elijah would happen. 
122Kg 10:18 Jehu called the people of Samaria together and said, "King Ahab served the god Baal a little, but I will serve him much more. 
122Kg 10:19 Call together all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests. No one is excused; I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal, and whoever is not present will be put to death." (This was a trick on the part of Jehu by which he meant to kill all the worshipers of Baal.) 
122Kg 10:20 Then Jehu ordered, "Proclaim a day of worship in honor of Baal!" The proclamation was made, 
122Kg 10:21 and Jehu sent word throughout all the land of Israel. All who worshiped Baal came; not one of them failed to come. They all went into the temple of Baal, filling it from one end to the other. 
122Kg 10:22 Then Jehu ordered the priest in charge of the sacred robes to bring the robes out and give them to the worshipers. 
122Kg 10:23 After that, Jehu himself went into the temple with Jonadab son of Rechab and said to the people there, "Make sure that only worshipers of Baal are present and that no worshiper of the LORD has come in." 
122Kg 10:24 Then he and Jonadab went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings to Baal. He had stationed eighty men outside the temple and had instructed them�� "You are to kill all these people; anyone who lets one of them escape will pay for it with his life!" 
122Kg 10:25 As soon as Jehu had presented the offerings, he said to the guards and officers, "Go in and kill them all; don't let anyone escape!" They went in with drawn swords, killed them all, and dragged the bodies outside. Then they went on into the inner sanctuary of the temple, 
122Kg 10:26 brought out the sacred pillar that was there, and burned it. 
122Kg 10:27 So they destroyed the sacred pillar and the temple, and turned the temple into a latrine - which it still is today. 
122Kg 10:28 That was how Jehu wiped out the worship of Baal in Israel. 
122Kg 10:29 But he imitated the sin of King Jeroboam, who led Israel into the sin of worshiping the gold bull-calves he set up in Bethel and in Dan. 
122Kg 10:30 The LORD said to Jehu, "You have done to Ahab's descendants everything I wanted you to do. So I promise you that your descendants, down to the fourth generation, will be kings of Israel." 
122Kg 10:31 But Jehu did not obey with all his heart the Law of the LORD, the God of Israel; instead, he followed the example of Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 10:32 At that time the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael of Syria conquered all the Israelite territory 
122Kg 10:33 east of the Jordan, as far south as the town of Aroer on the Arnon River - this included the territories of Gilead and Bashan, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and East Manasseh lived. 
122Kg 10:34 Everything else that Jehu did, including his brave deeds, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 10:35 He died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 10:36 Jehu had ruled in Samaria as king of Israel for twenty-eight years. 
122Kg 11:1 As soon as King Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned of her son's murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family to be killed. 
122Kg 11:2 Only Ahaziah's son Joash escaped. He was about to be killed with the others, but was rescued by his aunt Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's half sister. She took him and his nurse into a bedroom in the Temple and hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. 
122Kg 11:3 For six years Jehosheba took care of the boy and kept him hidden in the Temple, while Athaliah ruled as queen. 
122Kg 11:4 But in the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the officers in charge of the royal bodyguard and of the palace guards, and told them to come to the Temple, where he made them agree under oath to what he planned to do. He showed them King Ahaziah's son Joash 
122Kg 11:5 and gave them the following orders�� "When you come on duty on the Sabbath, one third of you are to guard the palace; 
122Kg 11:6 another third are to stand guard at the Sur Gate, and the other third are to stand guard at the gate behind the other guards. 
122Kg 11:7 The two groups that go off duty on the Sabbath are to stand guard at the Temple to protect the king. 
122Kg 11:8 You are to guard King Joash with drawn swords and stay with him wherever he goes. Anyone who comes near you is to be killed." 
122Kg 11:9 The officers obeyed Jehoiada's instructions and brought their men to him - those going off duty on the Sabbath and those going on duty. 
122Kg 11:10 He gave the officers the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and had been kept in the Temple, 
122Kg 11:11 and he stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple, to protect the king. 
122Kg 11:12 Then Jehoiada led Joash out, placed the crown on his head, and gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship. Then Joash was anointed and proclaimed king. The people clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!" 
122Kg 11:13 Queen Athaliah heard the noise being made by the guards and the people, so she hurried to the Temple, where the crowd had gathered. 
122Kg 11:14 There she saw the new king standing by the column at the entrance of the Temple, as was the custom. He was surrounded by the officers and the trumpeters, and the people were all shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes in distress and shouted, "Treason! Treason!" 
122Kg 11:15 Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area, so he ordered the army officers�� "Take her out between the rows of guards, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her." 
122Kg 11:16 They seized her, took her to the palace, and there at the Horse Gate they killed her. 
122Kg 11:17 The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people make a covenant with the LORD that they would be the LORD's people; he also made a covenant between the king and the people. 
122Kg 11:18 Then the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down; they smashed the altars and the idols, and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Jehoiada put guards on duty at the Temple, 
122Kg 11:19 and then he, the officers, the royal bodyguard, and the palace guards escorted the king from the Temple to the palace, followed by all the people. Joash entered by the Guard Gate and took his place on the throne. 
122Kg 11:20 All the people were filled with happiness, and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been killed in the palace. 
122Kg 11:21 Joash became king of Judah at the age of seven. 
122Kg 12:1 In the seventh year of the reign of King Jehu of Israel, Joash became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother was Zibiah from the city of Beersheba. 
122Kg 12:2 Throughout his life he did what pleased the LORD, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 
122Kg 12:3 However, the pagan places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 
122Kg 12:4 Joash called the priests and ordered them to save up the money paid in connection with the sacrifices in the Temple, both the dues paid for the regular sacrifices and the money given as freewill gifts. 
122Kg 12:5 Each priest was to be responsible for the money brought by those he served, and the money was to be used to repair the Temple, as needed. 
122Kg 12:6 But by the twenty-third year of Joash's reign the priests still had not made any repairs in the Temple. 
122Kg 12:7 So he called in Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them, "Why aren't you repairing the Temple? From now on you are not to keep the money you receive; you must hand it over, so that the repairs can be made." 
122Kg 12:8 The priests agreed to this and also agreed not to make the repairs in the Temple. 
122Kg 12:9 Then Jehoiada took a box, made a hole in the lid, and placed the box by the altar, on the right side as one enters the Temple. The priests on duty at the entrance put in the box all the money given by the worshipers. 
122Kg 12:10 Whenever there was a large amount of money in the box, the royal secretary and the High Priest would come, melt down the silver, and weigh it. 
122Kg 12:11 After recording the exact amount, they would hand the silver over to the men in charge of the work in the Temple, and these would pay the carpenters, the builders, 
122Kg 12:12 the masons, and the stone cutters, buy the timber and the stones used in the repairs, and pay all other necessary expenses. 
122Kg 12:13 None of the money, however, was used to pay for making silver cups, bowls, trumpets, or tools for tending the lamps, or any other article of silver or of gold. 
122Kg 12:14 It was all used to pay the workers and to buy the materials used in the repairs. 
122Kg 12:15 The men in charge of the work were thoroughly honest, so there was no need to require them to account for the funds. 
122Kg 12:16 The money given for the repayment offerings and for the offerings for sin was not deposited in the box; it belonged to the priests. 
122Kg 12:17 At that time King Hazael of Syria attacked the city of Gath and conquered it; then he decided to attack Jerusalem. 
122Kg 12:18 King Joash of Judah took all the offerings that his predecessors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated to the LORD, added to them his own offerings and all the gold in the treasuries of the Temple and the palace, and sent them all as a gift to King Hazael, who then led his army away from Jerusalem. 
122Kg 12:19 Everything else that King Joash did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 12:20 King Joash's officials plotted against him, and two of them, Jozacar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer, killed him at the house built on the land that was filled in on the east side of Jerusalem, on the road that goes down to Silla. 
122Kg 12:21 Joash was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Amaziah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 13:1 In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash son of Ahaziah as king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for seventeen years. 
122Kg 13:2 Like King Jeroboam before him, he sinned against the LORD and led Israel into sin; he never gave up his evil ways. 
122Kg 13:3 So the LORD was angry with Israel, and he allowed King Hazael of Syria and his son Benhadad to defeat Israel time after time. 
122Kg 13:4 Then Jehoahaz prayed to the LORD, and the LORD, seeing how harshly the king of Syria was oppressing the Israelites, answered his prayer. 
122Kg 13:5 The LORD sent Israel a leader, who freed them from the Syrians, and so the Israelites lived in peace, as before. 
122Kg 13:6 But they still did not give up the sins into which King Jeroboam had led Israel, but kept on committing them; and the image of the goddess Asherah remained in Samaria. 
122Kg 13:7 Jehoahaz had no armed forces left except fifty cavalry troops, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because the king of Syria had destroyed the rest, trampling them down like dust. 
122Kg 13:8 Everything else that Jehoahaz did and all his brave deeds are recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 13:9 He died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoash succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of King Joash of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for sixteen years. 
122Kg 13:11 He too sinned against the LORD and followed the evil example of King Jeroboam, who had led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 13:12 Everything else that Jehoash did, including his bravery in the war against King Amaziah of Judah, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 13:13 Jehoash died and was buried in the royal tombs in Samaria, and his son Jeroboam II succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 13:14 The prophet Elisha was sick with a fatal disease, and as he lay dying, King Jehoash of Israel went to visit him. "My father, my father!" he exclaimed as he wept. "You have been the mighty defender of Israel!" 
122Kg 13:15 "Get a bow and some arrows," Elisha ordered him. Jehoash got them, 
122Kg 13:16 and Elisha told him to get ready to shoot. The king did so, and Elisha placed his hands on the king's hands. 
122Kg 13:17 Then, following the prophet's instructions, the king opened the window that faced toward Syria. "Shoot the arrow!" Elisha ordered. As soon as the king shot the arrow, the prophet exclaimed, "You are the LORD's arrow, with which he will win victory over Syria. You will fight the Syrians in Aphek until you defeat them." 
122Kg 13:18 Then Elisha told the king to take the other arrows and strike the ground with them. The king struck the ground three times, and then stopped. 
122Kg 13:19 This made Elisha angry, and he said to the king, "You should have struck five or six times, and then you would have won complete victory over the Syrians; but now you will defeat them only three times." 
122Kg 13:20 Elisha died and was buried. Every year bands of Moabites used to invade the land of Israel. 
122Kg 13:21 One time during a funeral, one of those bands was seen, and the people threw the corpse into Elisha's tomb and ran off. As soon as the body came into contact with Elisha's bones, the man came back to life and stood up. 
122Kg 13:22 King Hazael of Syria oppressed the Israelites during all of Jehoahaz' reign, 
122Kg 13:23 but the LORD was kind and merciful to them. He would not let them be destroyed, but helped them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He has never forgotten his people. 
122Kg 13:24 At the death of King Hazael of Syria his son Benhadad became king. 
122Kg 13:25 Then King Jehoash of Israel defeated Benhadad three times and recaptured the cities that had been taken by Benhadad during the reign of Jehoahaz, the father of Jehoash. 
122Kg 14:1 In the second year of the reign of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz as king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah 
122Kg 14:2 at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem. 
122Kg 14:3 He did what was pleasing to the LORD, but he was not like his ancestor King David; instead, he did what his father Joash had done. 
122Kg 14:4 He did not tear down the pagan places of worship, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 
122Kg 14:5 As soon as Amaziah was firmly in power, he executed the officials who had killed his father, the king. 
122Kg 14:6 However, he did not kill their children but followed what the LORD had commanded in the Law of Moses�� "Parents are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their children, and children are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their parents; people are to be put to death only for a crime they themselves have committed." 
122Kg 14:7 Amaziah killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers in Salt Valley; he captured the city of Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, the name it still has. 
122Kg 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to King Jehoash of Israel, challenging him to fight. 
122Kg 14:9 But King Jehoash sent back the following reply�� "Once a thorn bush on the Lebanon Mountains sent a message to a cedar�� 'Give your daughter in marriage to my son.' A wild animal passed by and trampled the bush down. 
122Kg 14:10 Now Amaziah, you have defeated the Edomites, and you are filled with pride. Be satisfied with your fame and stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and your people?" 
122Kg 14:11 But Amaziah refused to listen, so King Jehoash marched out with his men and fought against him at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
122Kg 14:12 Amaziah's army was defeated, and all his soldiers fled to their homes. 
122Kg 14:13 Jehoash took Amaziah prisoner, advanced on Jerusalem, and tore down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of two hundred yards. 
122Kg 14:14 He took all the silver and gold he could find, all the Temple equipment and all the palace treasures, and carried them back to Samaria. He also took hostages with him. 
122Kg 14:15 Everything else that Jehoash did, including his bravery in the war against King Amaziah of Judah, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 14:16 Jehoash died and was buried in the royal tombs in Samaria, and his son Jeroboam II succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 14:17 King Amaziah of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash of Israel. 
122Kg 14:18 Everything else that Amaziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 14:19 There was a plot in Jerusalem to assassinate Amaziah, so he fled to the city of Lachish, but his enemies followed him there and killed him. 
122Kg 14:20 His body was carried back to Jerusalem on a horse and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. 
122Kg 14:21 The people of Judah then crowned his sixteen-year-old son Uzziah as king. 
122Kg 14:22 Uzziah reconquered and rebuilt Elath after his father's death. 
122Kg 14:23 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah son of Joash as king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for forty-one years. 
122Kg 14:24 He sinned against the LORD, following the wicked example of his predecessor King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 14:25 He reconquered all the territory that had belonged to Israel, from Hamath Pass in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. This was what the LORD, the God of Israel, had promised through his servant the prophet Jonah son of Amittai from Gath Hepher. 
122Kg 14:26 The LORD saw the terrible suffering of the Israelites; there was no one at all to help them. 
122Kg 14:27 But it was not the LORD's purpose to destroy Israel completely and forever, so he rescued them through King Jeroboam II. 
122Kg 14:28 Everything else that Jeroboam II did, his brave battles, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Israel, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 14:29 Jeroboam died and was buried in the royal tombs, and his son Zechariah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Jeroboam II of Israel, Uzziah son of Amaziah became king of Judah 
122Kg 15:2 at the age of sixteen, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
122Kg 15:3 Following the example of his father, he did what was pleasing to the LORD. 
122Kg 15:4 But the pagan places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 
122Kg 15:5 The LORD struck Uzziah with a dreaded skin disease that stayed with him the rest of his life. He lived in a separate house, relieved of all duties, while his son Jotham governed the country. 
122Kg 15:6 Everything else that Uzziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 15:7 Uzziah died and was buried in the royal burial ground in David's City, and his son Jotham succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam II became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for six months. 
122Kg 15:9 He, like his predecessors, sinned against the LORD. He followed the wicked example of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 15:10 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against King Zechariah, assassinated him at Ibleam, and succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:11 Everything else that Zechariah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:12 So the promise was fulfilled which the LORD had made to King Jehu�� "Your descendants down to the fourth generation will be kings of Israel." 
122Kg 15:13 In the thirty-ninth year of the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, Shallum son of Jabesh became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for one month. 
122Kg 15:14 Menahem son of Gadi went from Tirzah to Samaria, assassinated Shallum, and succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:15 Everything else that Shallum did, including an account of his conspiracy, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:16 As Menahem was on his way from Tirzah, he completely destroyed the city of Tappuah, its inhabitants, and the surrounding territory, because the city did not surrender to him. He even ripped open the bellies of all the pregnant women. 
122Kg 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for ten years. 
122Kg 15:18 He sinned against the LORD, for until the day of his death he followed the wicked example of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 15:19 Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, invaded Israel, and Menahem gave him thirty-eight tons of silver to gain his support in strengthening Menahem's power over the country. 
122Kg 15:20 Menahem got the money from the rich men of Israel by forcing each one to contribute fifty pieces of silver. So Tiglath Pileser went back to his own country. 
122Kg 15:21 Everything else that Menahem did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:22 He died and was buried, and his son Pekahiah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:23 In the fiftieth year of the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for two years. 
122Kg 15:24 He sinned against the LORD, following the wicked example of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 15:25 An officer of Pekahiah's forces, Pekah son of Remaliah, plotted with fifty men from Gilead, assassinated Pekahiah in the palace's inner fortress in Samaria, and succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:26 Everything else that Pekahiah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:27 In the fifty-second year of the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for twenty years. 
122Kg 15:28 He sinned against the LORD, following the wicked example of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. 
122Kg 15:29 It was while Pekah was king that Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, captured the cities of Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor, and the territories of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali, and took the people to Assyria as prisoners. 
122Kg 15:30 In the twentieth year of the reign of Jotham son of Uzziah as king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah plotted against King Pekah, assassinated him, and succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 15:31 Everything else that Pekah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:32 In the second year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah as king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah 
122Kg 15:33 at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 
122Kg 15:34 Following the example of his father Uzziah, Jotham did what was pleasing to the LORD. 
122Kg 15:35 But the pagan places of worship were not destroyed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. It was Jotham who built the North Gate of the Temple. 
122Kg 15:36 Everything else that Jotham did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 15:37 It was while he was king that the LORD first sent King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah of Israel to attack Judah. 
122Kg 15:38 Jotham died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 16:1 In the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah as king of Israel, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah 
122Kg 16:2 at the age of twenty, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not follow the good example of his ancestor King David; instead, he did what was not pleasing to the LORD his God 
122Kg 16:3 and followed the example of the kings of Israel. He even sacrificed his own son as a burnt offering to idols, imitating the disgusting practice of the people whom the LORD had driven out of the land as the Israelites advanced. 
122Kg 16:4 At the pagan places of worship, on the hills, and under every shady tree, Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense. 
122Kg 16:5 King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah of Israel attacked Jerusalem and besieged it, but could not defeat Ahaz. 
122Kg 16:6 (At the same time the king of Edom regained control of the city of Elath and drove out the Judeans who lived there. The Edomites settled in Elath and still live there.) 
122Kg 16:7 Ahaz sent men to Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, with this message�� "I am your devoted servant. Come and rescue me from the kings of Syria and of Israel, who are attacking me." 
122Kg 16:8 Ahaz took the silver and gold from the Temple and the palace treasury, and sent it as a present to the emperor. 
122Kg 16:9 Tiglath Pileser, in answer to Ahaz' plea, marched out with his army against Damascus, captured it, killed King Rezin, and took the people to Kir as prisoners. 
122Kg 16:10 When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Emperor Tiglath Pileser, he saw the altar there and sent back to Uriah the priest an exact model of it, down to the smallest details. 
122Kg 16:11 So Uriah built an altar just like it and finished it before Ahaz returned. 
122Kg 16:12 On his return from Damascus, Ahaz saw that the altar was finished, 
122Kg 16:13 so he burned animal sacrifices and grain offerings on it and poured a wine offering and the blood of a fellowship offering on it. 
122Kg 16:14 The bronze altar dedicated to the LORD was between the new altar and the Temple, so Ahaz moved it to the north side of his new altar. 
122Kg 16:15 Then he ordered Uriah�� "Use this large altar of mine for the morning burnt offerings and the evening grain offerings, for the burnt offerings and grain offerings of the king and the people, and for the people's wine offerings. Pour on it the blood of all the animals that are sacrificed. But keep the bronze altar for me to use for divination." 
122Kg 16:16 Uriah did as the king commanded. 
122Kg 16:17 King Ahaz took apart the bronze carts used in the Temple and removed the basins that were on them. He also took the bronze tank from the backs of the twelve bronze bulls and placed it on a stone foundation. 
122Kg 16:18 And in order to please the Assyrian emperor, Ahaz also removed from the Temple the platform for the royal throne and closed up the king's private entrance to the Temple. 
122Kg 16:19 Everything else that King Ahaz did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 16:20 Ahaz died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City, and his son Hezekiah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 17:1 In the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel, and he ruled in Samaria for nine years. 
122Kg 17:2 He sinned against the LORD, but not as much as the kings who had ruled Israel before him. 
122Kg 17:3 Emperor Shalmaneser of Assyria made war against him; Hoshea surrendered to Shalmaneser and paid him tribute every year. 
122Kg 17:4 But one year Hoshea sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, asking for his help, and stopped paying the annual tribute to Assyria. When Shalmaneser learned of this, he had Hoshea arrested and put in prison. 
122Kg 17:5 Then Shalmaneser invaded Israel and besieged Samaria. In the third year of the siege, 
122Kg 17:6 which was the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea, the Assyrian emperor captured Samaria, took the Israelites to Assyria as prisoners, and settled some of them in the city of Halah, some near the Habor River in the district of Gozan and some in the cities of Media. 
122Kg 17:7 Samaria fell because the Israelites sinned against the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the king of Egypt and had led them out of Egypt. They worshiped other gods, 
122Kg 17:8 followed the customs of the people whom the LORD had driven out as his people advanced, and adopted customs introduced by the kings of Israel. 
122Kg 17:9 The Israelites did things that the LORD their God disapproved of. They built pagan places of worship in all their towns, from the smallest village to the largest city. 
122Kg 17:10 On all the hills and under every shady tree they put up stone pillars and images of the goddess Asherah, 
122Kg 17:11 and they burned incense on all the pagan altars, following the practice of the people whom the LORD had driven out of the land. They aroused the LORD's anger with all their wicked deeds 
122Kg 17:12 and disobeyed the LORD's command not to worship idols. 
122Kg 17:13 The LORD had sent his messengers and prophets to warn Israel and Judah�� "Abandon your evil ways and obey my commands, which are contained in the Law I gave to your ancestors and which I handed on to you through my servants the prophets." 
122Kg 17:14 But they would not obey; they were stubborn like their ancestors, who had not trusted in the LORD their God. 
122Kg 17:15 They refused to obey his instructions, they did not keep the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and they disregarded his warnings. They worshiped worthless idols and became worthless themselves, and they followed the customs of the surrounding nations, disobeying the LORD's command not to imitate them. 
122Kg 17:16 They broke all the laws of the LORD their God and made two metal bull-calves to worship; they also made an image of the goddess Asherah, worshiped the stars, and served the god Baal. 
122Kg 17:17 They sacrificed their sons and daughters as burnt offerings to pagan gods; they consulted mediums and fortunetellers, and they devoted themselves completely to doing what is wrong in the LORD's sight, and so aroused his anger. 
122Kg 17:18 The LORD was angry with the Israelites and banished them from his sight, leaving only the kingdom of Judah. 
122Kg 17:19 But even the people of Judah did not obey the laws of the LORD their God; they imitated the customs adopted by the people of Israel. 
122Kg 17:20 The LORD rejected all the Israelites, punishing them and handing them over to cruel enemies until at last he had banished them from his sight. 
122Kg 17:21 After the LORD had separated Israel from Judah, the Israelites made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam caused them to abandon the LORD and led them into terrible sins. 
122Kg 17:22 They followed Jeroboam and continued to practice all the sins he had committed, 
122Kg 17:23 until at last the LORD banished them from his sight, as he had warned through his servants the prophets that he would do. So the people of Israel were taken into exile to Assyria, where they still live. 
122Kg 17:24 The emperor of Assyria took people from the cities of Babylon, Cuth, Ivvah, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the exiled Israelites. They took possession of these cities and lived there. 
122Kg 17:25 When they first settled there, they did not worship the LORD, and so he sent lions, which killed some of them. 
122Kg 17:26 The emperor of Assyria was told that the people he had settled in the cities of Samaria did not know the law of the god of that land, and so the god had sent lions, which were killing them. 
122Kg 17:27 So the emperor commanded�� "Send back one of the priests we brought as prisoners; have him go back and live there, in order to teach the people the law of the god of that land." 
122Kg 17:28 So an Israelite priest who had been deported from Samaria went and lived in Bethel, where he taught the people how to worship the LORD. 
122Kg 17:29 But the people who settled in Samaria continued to make their own idols, and they placed them in the shrines that the Israelites had built. Each different group made idols in the cities they were living in��
122Kg 17:30 the people of Babylon made idols of the god Succoth Benoth; the people of Cuth, idols of Nergal; the people of Hamath, idols of Ashima; 
122Kg 17:31 the people of Ivvah, idols of Nibhaz and Tartak; and the people of Sepharvaim sacrificed their children as burnt offerings to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech. 
122Kg 17:32 These people also worshiped the LORD and chose from among their own number all sorts of people to serve as priests at the pagan places of worship and to offer sacrifices for them there. 
122Kg 17:33 So they worshiped the LORD, but they also worshiped their own gods according to the customs of the countries from which they had come. 
122Kg 17:34 They still carry on their old customs to this day. They do not worship the LORD nor do they obey the laws and commands which he gave to the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel. 
122Kg 17:35 The LORD had made a covenant with them and had ordered them�� "Do not worship other gods; do not bow down to them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them. 
122Kg 17:36 You shall obey me, the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt with great power and strength; you are to bow down to me and offer sacrifices to me. 
122Kg 17:37 You shall always obey the laws and commands that I wrote for you. You shall not obey other gods, 
122Kg 17:38 and you shall not forget the covenant I made with you. 
122Kg 17:39 You shall obey me, the LORD your God, and I will rescue you from your enemies." 
122Kg 17:40 But those people would not listen, and they continued to follow their old customs. 
122Kg 17:41 So those people worshiped the LORD, but they also worshiped their idols; and to this day their descendants continue to do the same. 
122Kg 18:1 In the third year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah as king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah 
122Kg 18:2 at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
122Kg 18:3 Following the example of his ancestor King David, he did what was pleasing to the LORD. 
122Kg 18:4 He destroyed the pagan places of worship, broke the stone pillars, and cut down the images of the goddess Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze snake that Moses had made, which was called Nehushtan. Up to that time the people of Israel had burned incense in its honor. 
122Kg 18:5 Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel; Judah never had another king like him, either before or after his time. 
122Kg 18:6 He was faithful to the LORD and never disobeyed him, but carefully kept all the commands that the LORD had given Moses. 
122Kg 18:7 So the LORD was with him, and he was successful in everything he did. He rebelled against the emperor of Assyria and refused to submit to him. 
122Kg 18:8 He defeated the Philistines and raided their settlements, from the smallest village to the largest city, including Gaza and its surrounding territory. 
122Kg 18:9 In the fourth year of Hezekiah's reign - which was the seventh year of King Hoshea's reign over Israel - Emperor Shalmaneser of Assyria invaded Israel and besieged Samaria. 
122Kg 18:10 In the third year of the siege Samaria fell; this was the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign and the ninth year of Hoshea's reign. 
122Kg 18:11 The Assyrian emperor took the Israelites to Assyria as prisoners and settled some of them in the city of Halah, some near the Habor River in the district of Gozan, and some in the cities of Media. 
122Kg 18:12 Samaria fell because the Israelites did not obey the LORD their God, but broke the covenant he had made with them and disobeyed all the laws given by Moses, the servant of the LORD. They would not listen and they would not obey. 
122Kg 18:13 In the fourteenth year of the reign of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and conquered them. 
122Kg 18:14 Hezekiah sent a message to Sennacherib, who was in Lachish�� "I have done wrong; please stop your attack, and I will pay whatever you demand." The emperor's answer was that Hezekiah should send him ten tons of silver and one ton of gold. 
122Kg 18:15 Hezekiah sent him all the silver in the Temple and in the palace treasury; 
122Kg 18:16 he also stripped the gold from the temple doors and the gold with which he himself had covered the doorposts, and he sent it all to Sennacherib. 
122Kg 18:17 The Assyrian emperor sent a large army from Lachish to attack Hezekiah at Jerusalem; it was commanded by his three highest officials. When they arrived at Jerusalem, they occupied the road where the cloth makers work by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. 
122Kg 18:18 Then they sent for King Hezekiah, and three of his officials went out to meet them�� Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace; Shebna, the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, who was in charge of the records. 
122Kg 18:19 One of the Assyrian officials told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident. 
122Kg 18:20 He demanded, "Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might? Who do you think will help you rebel against Assyria? 
122Kg 18:21 You are expecting Egypt to help you, but that would be like using a reed as a walking stick - it would break and jab your hand. That is what the king of Egypt is like when anyone relies on him." 
122Kg 18:22 The Assyrian official went on, "Or will you tell me that you are relying on the LORD your God? It was the LORD's shrines and altars that Hezekiah destroyed, when he told the people of Judah and Jerusalem to worship only at the altar in Jerusalem. 
122Kg 18:23 I will make a bargain with you in the name of the emperor. I will give you two thousand horses if you can find that many men to ride them! 
122Kg 18:24 You are no match for even the lowest ranking Assyrian official, and yet you expect the Egyptians to send you chariots and cavalry! 
122Kg 18:25 Do you think I have attacked your country and destroyed it without the LORD's help? The LORD himself told me to attack it and destroy it." 
122Kg 18:26 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the official, "Speak Aramaic to us, sir. We understand it. Don't speak Hebrew; all the people on the wall are listening." 
122Kg 18:27 He replied, "Do you think you and the king are the only ones the emperor sent me to say all these things to? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall, who will have to eat their excrement and drink their urine, just as you will." 
122Kg 18:28 Then the official stood up and shouted in Hebrew, "Listen to what the emperor of Assyria is telling you! 
122Kg 18:29 He warns you not to let Hezekiah deceive you. Hezekiah can't save you. 
122Kg 18:30 And don't let him persuade you to rely on the LORD. Don't think that the LORD will save you and that he will stop our Assyrian army from capturing your city. 
122Kg 18:31 Don't listen to Hezekiah. The emperor of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. You will all be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells - 
122Kg 18:32 until the emperor resettles you in a country much like your own, where there are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread; it is a land of olives, olive oil, and honey. If you do what he commands, you will not die, but live. Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the LORD will rescue you. 
122Kg 18:33 Did the gods of any other nations save their countries from the emperor of Assyria? 
122Kg 18:34 Where are they now, the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did anyone save Samaria? 
122Kg 18:35 When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our emperor? Then what makes you think the LORD can save Jerusalem?" 
122Kg 18:36 The people kept quiet, just as King Hezekiah had told them to; they did not say a word. 
122Kg 18:37 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes in grief, and went and reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said. 
122Kg 19:1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes in grief, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple of the LORD. 
122Kg 19:2 He sent Eliakim, the official in charge of the palace, Shebna, the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They also were wearing sackcloth. 
122Kg 19:3 This is the message which he told them to give Isaiah�� "Today is a day of suffering; we are being punished and are in disgrace. We are like a woman who is ready to give birth, but is too weak to do it. 
122Kg 19:4 The Assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living God. May the LORD your God hear these insults and punish those who spoke them. So pray to God for those of our people who survive." 
122Kg 19:5 When Isaiah received King Hezekiah's message, 
122Kg 19:6 he sent back this answer�� "The LORD tells you not to let the Assyrians frighten you with their claims that he cannot save you. 
122Kg 19:7 The LORD will cause the emperor to hear a rumor that will make him go back to his own country, and the LORD will have him killed there." 
122Kg 19:8 The Assyrian official learned that the emperor had left Lachish and was fighting against the nearby city of Libnah; so he went there to consult him. 
122Kg 19:9 Word reached the Assyrians that the Egyptian army, led by King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, was coming to attack them. When the emperor heard this, he sent a letter to King Hezekiah of Judah 
122Kg 19:10 to tell him, "The god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands, but don't let that deceive you. 
122Kg 19:11 You have heard what an Assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy. Do you think that you can escape? 
122Kg 19:12 My ancestors destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and killed the people of Betheden who lived in Telassar, and none of their gods could save them. 
122Kg 19:13 Where are the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?" 
122Kg 19:14 King Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went to the Temple, placed the letter there in the presence of the LORD, 
122Kg 19:15 and prayed, "O LORD, the God of Israel, seated on your throne above the winged creatures, you alone are God, ruling all the kingdoms of the world. You created the earth and the sky. 
122Kg 19:16 Now, LORD, look at what is happening to us. Listen to all the things that Sennacherib is saying to insult you, the living God. 
122Kg 19:17 We all know, LORD, that the emperors of Assyria have destroyed many nations, made their lands desolate, 
122Kg 19:18 and burned up their gods - which were no gods at all, only images of wood and stone made by human hands. 
122Kg 19:19 Now, LORD our God, rescue us from the Assyrians, so that all the nations of the world will know that only you, O LORD, are God." 
122Kg 19:20 Then Isaiah sent a message telling King Hezekiah that in answer to the king's prayer 
122Kg 19:21 the LORD had said, "The city of Jerusalem laughs at you, Sennacherib, and makes fun of you. 
122Kg 19:22 Whom do you think you have been insulting and ridiculing? You have been disrespectful to me, the holy God of Israel. 
122Kg 19:23 You sent your messengers to boast to me that with all your chariots you had conquered the highest mountains of Lebanon. You boasted that there you cut down the tallest cedars and the finest cypress trees and that you reached the deepest parts of the forests. 
122Kg 19:24 You boasted that you dug wells and drank water in foreign lands and that the feet of your soldiers tramped the Nile River dry. 
122Kg 19:25 "Have you never heard that I planned all this long ago? And now I have carried it out. I gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble. 
122Kg 19:26 The people who lived there were powerless; they were frightened and stunned. They were like grass in a field or weeds growing on a roof when the hot east wind blasts them. 
122Kg 19:27 "But I know everything about you, what you do and where you go. I know how you rage against me. 
122Kg 19:28 I have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours, and now I will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth, and take you back by the same road you came." 
122Kg 19:29 Then Isaiah said to King Hezekiah, "Here is a sign of what will happen. This year and next you will have only wild grain to eat, but the following year you will be able to plant your grain and harvest it, and plant vines and eat grapes. 
122Kg 19:30 Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit. 
122Kg 19:31 There will be people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive, because the LORD is determined to make this happen. 
122Kg 19:32 "And this is what the LORD has said about the Assyrian emperor�� 'He will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it. No soldiers with shields will come near the city, and no siege mounds will be built around it. 
122Kg 19:33 He will go back by the same road he came, without entering this city. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
122Kg 19:34 I will defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.' " 
122Kg 19:35 That night an angel of the LORD went to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 soldiers. At dawn the next day there they lay, all dead! 
122Kg 19:36 Then the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh. 
122Kg 19:37 One day, when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords and then escaped to the land of Ararat. Another of his sons, Esarhaddon, succeeded him as emperor. 
122Kg 20:1 About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and said to him, "The LORD tells you that you are to put everything in order, because you will not recover. Get ready to die." 
122Kg 20:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed��
122Kg 20:3 "Remember, LORD, that I have served you faithfully and loyally and that I have always tried to do what you wanted me to." And he began to cry bitterly. 
122Kg 20:4 Isaiah left the king, but before he had passed through the central courtyard of the palace the LORD told him 
122Kg 20:5 to go back to Hezekiah, ruler of the LORD's people, and say to him, "I, the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you, and in three days you will go to the Temple. 
122Kg 20:6 I will let you live fifteen years longer. I will rescue you and this city Jerusalem from the emperor of Assyria. I will defend this city, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David." 
122Kg 20:7 Then Isaiah told the king's attendants to put on his boil a paste made of figs, and he would get well. 
122Kg 20:8 King Hezekiah asked, "What is the sign to prove that the LORD will heal me and that three days later I will be able to go to the Temple?" 
122Kg 20:9 Isaiah replied, "The LORD will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise. Now, would you prefer to have the shadow on the stairway go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?" 
122Kg 20:10 Hezekiah answered, "It's easy to have the shadow go forward ten steps! Have it go back ten steps." 
122Kg 20:11 Isaiah prayed to the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back ten steps on the stairway set up by King Ahaz. 
122Kg 20:12 About that same time the king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been sick, so he sent him a letter and a present. 
122Kg 20:13 Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth - his silver and gold, his spices and perfumes, and all his military equipment. There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them. 
122Kg 20:14 Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, "Where did these men come from and what did they say to you?" Hezekiah answered, "They came from a very distant country, from Babylonia." 
122Kg 20:15 "What did they see in the palace?" "They saw everything. There is nothing in the storerooms that I didn't show them." 
122Kg 20:16 Isaiah then told the king, "The LORD Almighty says that 
122Kg 20:17 a time is coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylonia. Nothing will be left. 
122Kg 20:18 Some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylonia." 
122Kg 20:19 King Hezekiah understood this to mean that there would be peace and security during his lifetime, so he replied, "The message you have given me from the LORD is good." 
122Kg 20:20 Everything else that King Hezekiah did, his brave deeds, and an account of how he built a reservoir and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 20:21 Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. His mother was Hephzibah. 
122Kg 21:2 Following the disgusting practices of the nations whom the LORD had driven out of the land as his people advanced, Manasseh sinned against the LORD. 
122Kg 21:3 He rebuilt the pagan places of worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he built altars for the worship of Baal and made an image of the goddess Asherah, as King Ahab of Israel had done. Manasseh also worshiped the stars. 
122Kg 21:4 He built pagan altars in the Temple, the place that the LORD had said was where he should be worshiped. 
122Kg 21:5 In the two courtyards of the Temple he built altars for the worship of the stars. 
122Kg 21:6 He sacrificed his son as a burnt offering. He practiced divination and magic and consulted fortunetellers and mediums. He sinned greatly against the LORD and stirred up his anger. 
122Kg 21:7 He placed the symbol of the goddess Asherah in the Temple, the place about which the LORD had said to David and his son Solomon�� "Here in Jerusalem, in this Temple, is the place that I have chosen out of all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel as the place where I am to be worshiped. 
122Kg 21:8 And if the people of Israel will obey all my commands and keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them, then I will not allow them to be driven out of the land that I gave to their ancestors." 
122Kg 21:9 But the people of Judah did not obey the LORD, and Manasseh led them to commit even greater sins than those committed by the nations whom the LORD had driven out of the land as his people advanced. 
122Kg 21:10 Through his servants the prophets the LORD said, 
122Kg 21:11 "King Manasseh has done these disgusting things, things far worse than what the Canaanites did; and with his idols he has led the people of Judah into sin. 
122Kg 21:12 So I, the LORD God of Israel, will bring such a disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that everyone who hears about it will be stunned. 
122Kg 21:13 I will punish Jerusalem as I did Samaria, as I did King Ahab of Israel and his descendants. I will wipe Jerusalem clean of its people, as clean as a plate that has been wiped and turned upside down. 
122Kg 21:14 I will abandon the people who survive, and will hand them over to their enemies, who will conquer them and plunder their land. 
122Kg 21:15 I will do this to my people because they have sinned against me and have stirred up my anger from the time their ancestors came out of Egypt to this day." 
122Kg 21:16 Manasseh killed so many innocent people that the streets of Jerusalem were flowing with blood; he did this in addition to leading the people of Judah into idolatry, causing them to sin against the LORD. 
122Kg 21:17 Everything else that Manasseh did, including the sins he committed, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 21:18 Manasseh died and was buried in the palace garden, the garden of Uzza, and his son Amon succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for two years. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz from the town of Jotbah. 
122Kg 21:20 Like his father Manasseh, he sinned against the LORD; 
122Kg 21:21 he imitated his father's actions, and he worshiped the idols that his father had worshiped. 
122Kg 21:22 He rejected the LORD, the God of his ancestors, and disobeyed the LORD's commands. 
122Kg 21:23 Amon's officials plotted against him and assassinated him in the palace. 
122Kg 21:24 The people of Judah killed Amon's assassins and made his son Josiah king. 
122Kg 21:25 Everything else that Amon did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 21:26 Amon was buried in the tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for thirty-one years. His mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from the town of Bozkath. 
122Kg 22:2 Josiah did what was pleasing to the LORD; he followed the example of his ancestor King David, strictly obeying all the laws of God. 
122Kg 22:3 In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the court secretary Shaphan, the son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, to the Temple with the order��
122Kg 22:4 "Go to the High Priest Hilkiah and get a report on the amount of money that the priests on duty at the entrance to the Temple have collected from the people. 
122Kg 22:5 Tell him to give the money to the men who are in charge of the repairs in the Temple. They are to pay 
122Kg 22:6 the carpenters, the builders, and the masons, and buy the timber and the stones used in the repairs. 
122Kg 22:7 The men in charge of the work are thoroughly honest, so there is no need to require them to account for the funds." 
122Kg 22:8 Shaphan delivered the king's order to Hilkiah, and Hilkiah told him that he had found the book of the Law in the Temple. Hilkiah gave him the book, and Shaphan read it. 
122Kg 22:9 Then he went back to the king and reported�� "Your servants have taken the money that was in the Temple and have handed it over to the men in charge of the repairs." 
122Kg 22:10 And then he said, "I have here a book that Hilkiah gave me." And he read it aloud to the king. 
122Kg 22:11 When the king heard the book being read, he tore his clothes in dismay, 
122Kg 22:12 and gave the following order to Hilkiah the priest, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, to Achbor son of Micaiah, to Shaphan, the court secretary, and to Asaiah, the king's attendant��
122Kg 22:13 "Go and consult the LORD for me and for all the people of Judah about the teachings of this book. The LORD is angry with us because our ancestors have not done what this book says must be done." 
122Kg 22:14 Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to consult a woman named Huldah, a prophet who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. (Her husband Shallum, the son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas, was in charge of the Temple robes.) They described to her what had happened, 
122Kg 22:15 and she told them to go back to the king and give him 
122Kg 22:16 the following message from the LORD�� "I am going to punish Jerusalem and all its people, as written in the book that the king has read. 
122Kg 22:17 They have rejected me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and so have stirred up my anger by all they have done. My anger is aroused against Jerusalem, and it will not die down. 
122Kg 22:18 As for the king himself, this is what I, the LORD God of Israel, say�� You listened to what is written in the book, 
122Kg 22:19 and you repented and humbled yourself before me, tearing your clothes and weeping, when you heard how I threatened to punish Jerusalem and its people. I will make it a terrifying sight, a place whose name people will use as a curse. But I have heard your prayer, 
122Kg 22:20 and the punishment which I am going to bring on Jerusalem will not come until after your death. I will let you die in peace." The men returned to King Josiah with this message. 
122Kg 23:1 King Josiah summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, 
122Kg 23:2 and together they went to the Temple, accompanied by the priests and the prophets and all the rest of the people, rich and poor alike. Before them all the king read aloud the whole book of the covenant which had been found in the Temple. 
122Kg 23:3 He stood by the royal column and made a covenant with the LORD to obey him, to keep his laws and commands with all his heart and soul, and to put into practice the demands attached to the covenant, as written in the book. And all the people promised to keep the covenant. 
122Kg 23:4 Then Josiah ordered the High Priest Hilkiah, his assistant priests, and the guards on duty at the entrance to the Temple to bring out of the Temple all the objects used in the worship of Baal, of the goddess Asherah, and of the stars. The king burned all these objects outside the city near Kidron Valley and then had the ashes taken to Bethel. 
122Kg 23:5 He removed from office the priests that the kings of Judah had ordained to offer sacrifices on the pagan altars in the cities of Judah and in places near Jerusalem - all the priests who offered sacrifices to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars. 
122Kg 23:6 He removed from the Temple the symbol of the goddess Asherah, took it out of the city to Kidron Valley, burned it, pounded its ashes to dust, and scattered it over the public burying ground. 
122Kg 23:7 He destroyed the living quarters in the Temple occupied by the temple prostitutes. (It was there that women wove robes used in the worship of Asherah.) 
122Kg 23:8 He brought to Jerusalem the priests who were in the cities of Judah, and throughout the whole country he desecrated the altars where they had offered sacrifices. He also tore down the altars dedicated to the goat demons near the gate built by Joshua, the city governor, which was to the left of the main gate as one enters the city. 
122Kg 23:9 Those priests were not allowed to serve in the Temple, but they could eat the unleavened bread provided for their fellow priests. 
122Kg 23:10 King Josiah also desecrated Topheth, the pagan place of worship in Hinnom Valley, so that no one could sacrifice his son or daughter as a burnt offering to the god Molech. 
122Kg 23:11 He also removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the worship of the sun, and he burned the chariots used in this worship. (These were kept in the temple courtyard, near the gate and not far from the living quarters of Nathan Melech, a high official.) 
122Kg 23:12 The altars which the kings of Judah had built on the palace roof above King Ahaz' quarters, King Josiah tore down, along with the altars put up by King Manasseh in the two courtyards of the Temple; he smashed the altars to bits and threw them into Kidron Valley. 
122Kg 23:13 Josiah desecrated the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Olives, for the worship of disgusting idols - Astarte the goddess of Sidon, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Molech the god of Ammon. 
122Kg 23:14 King Josiah broke the stone pillars to pieces, cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and the ground where they had stood he covered with human bones. 
122Kg 23:15 Josiah also tore down the place of worship in Bethel, which had been built by King Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into sin. Josiah pulled down the altar, broke its stones into pieces, and pounded them to dust; he also burned the image of Asherah. 
122Kg 23:16 Then Josiah looked around and saw some tombs there on the hill; he had the bones taken out of them and burned on the altar. In this way he desecrated the altar, doing what the prophet had predicted long before during the festival as King Jeroboam was standing by the altar. King Josiah looked around and saw the tomb of the prophet who had made this prediction. 
122Kg 23:17 "Whose tomb is that?" he asked. The people of Bethel answered, "It is the tomb of the prophet who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done to this altar." 
122Kg 23:18 "Leave it as it is," Josiah ordered. "His bones are not to be moved." So his bones were not moved, neither were those of the prophet who had come from Samaria. 
122Kg 23:19 In every city of Israel King Josiah tore down all the pagan places of worship which had been built by the kings of Israel, who thereby aroused the LORD's anger. He did to all those altars what he had done in Bethel. 
122Kg 23:20 He killed all the pagan priests on the altars where they served, and he burned human bones on every altar. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
122Kg 23:21 King Josiah ordered the people to celebrate the Passover in honor of the LORD their God, as written in the book of the covenant. 
122Kg 23:22 No Passover like this one had ever been celebrated by any of the kings of Israel or of Judah, since the time when judges ruled the nation. 
122Kg 23:23 Now at last, in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, the Passover was celebrated in Jerusalem. 
122Kg 23:24 In order to enforce the laws written in the book that the High Priest Hilkiah had found in the Temple, King Josiah removed from Jerusalem and the rest of Judah all the mediums and fortunetellers, and all the household gods, idols, and all other pagan objects of worship. 
122Kg 23:25 There had never been a king like him before, who served the LORD with all his heart, mind, and strength, obeying all the Law of Moses; nor has there been a king like him since. 
122Kg 23:26 But the LORD's fierce anger had been aroused against Judah by what King Manasseh had done, and even now it did not die down. 
122Kg 23:27 The LORD said, "I will do to Judah what I have done to Israel�� I will banish the people of Judah from my sight, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and the Temple, the place I said was where I should be worshiped." 
122Kg 23:28 Everything else that King Josiah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 23:29 While Josiah was king, King Neco of Egypt led an army to the Euphrates River to help the emperor of Assyria. King Josiah tried to stop the Egyptian army at Megiddo and was killed in battle. 
122Kg 23:30 His officials placed his body in a chariot and took it back to Jerusalem, where he was buried in the royal tombs. The people of Judah chose Josiah's son Joahaz and anointed him king. 
122Kg 23:31 Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from the city of Libnah. 
122Kg 23:32 Following the example of his ancestors, he sinned against the LORD. 
122Kg 23:33 His reign ended when King Neco of Egypt took him prisoner in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, and made Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold as tribute. 
122Kg 23:34 King Neco made Josiah's son Eliakim king of Judah as successor to Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Joahaz was taken to Egypt by King Neco, and there he died. 
122Kg 23:35 King Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people in proportion to their wealth, in order to raise the amount needed to pay the tribute demanded by the king of Egypt. 
122Kg 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah from the town of Rumah. 
122Kg 23:37 Following the example of his ancestors, Jehoiakim sinned against the LORD. 
122Kg 24:1 While Jehoiakim was king, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded Judah, and for three years Jehoiakim was forced to submit to his rule; then he rebelled. 
122Kg 24:2 The LORD sent armed bands of Babylonians, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites against Jehoiakim to destroy Judah, as the LORD had said through his servants the prophets that he would do. 
122Kg 24:3 This happened at the LORD's command, in order to banish the people of Judah from his sight because of all the sins that King Manasseh had committed, 
122Kg 24:4 and especially because of all the innocent people he had killed. The LORD could not forgive Manasseh for that. 
122Kg 24:5 Everything that Jehoiakim did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 24:6 Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king. 
122Kg 24:7 The king of Egypt and his army never marched out of Egypt again, because the king of Babylonia now controlled all the territory that had belonged to Egypt, from the Euphrates River to the northern border of Egypt. 
122Kg 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. His mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
122Kg 24:9 Following the example of his father, Jehoiachin sinned against the LORD. 
122Kg 24:10 It was during his reign that the Babylonian army, commanded by King Nebuchadnezzar's officers, marched against Jerusalem and besieged it. 
122Kg 24:11 During the siege Nebuchadnezzar himself came to Jerusalem, 
122Kg 24:12 and King Jehoiachin, along with his mother, his sons, his officers, and the palace officials, surrendered to the Babylonians. In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign he took Jehoiachin prisoner 
122Kg 24:13 and carried off to Babylon all the treasures in the Temple and the palace. As the LORD had foretold, Nebuchadnezzar broke up all the gold utensils which King Solomon had made for use in the Temple. 
122Kg 24:14 Nebuchadnezzar carried away as prisoners the people of Jerusalem, all the royal princes, and all the leading men, ten thousand in all. He also deported all the skilled workers, including the blacksmiths, leaving only the poorest of the people behind in Judah. 
122Kg 24:15 Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylon as a prisoner, together with Jehoiachin's mother, his wives, his officials, and the leading men of Judah. 
122Kg 24:16 Nebuchadnezzar deported all the important men to Babylonia, seven thousand in all, and one thousand skilled workers, including the blacksmiths, all of them able-bodied men fit for military duty. 
122Kg 24:17 Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah king of Judah and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
122Kg 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from the city of Libnah. 
122Kg 24:19 King Zedekiah sinned against the LORD, just as King Jehoiakim had done. 
122Kg 24:20 The LORD became so angry with the people of Jerusalem and Judah that he banished them from his sight. 
122Kg 25:1 Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, and so Nebuchadnezzar came with all his army and attacked Jerusalem on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign. They set up camp outside the city, built siege walls around it, 
122Kg 25:2 and kept it under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year. 
122Kg 25:3 On the ninth day of the fourth month of that same year, when the famine was so bad that the people had nothing left to eat, 
122Kg 25:4 the city walls were broken through. Although the Babylonians were surrounding the city, all the soldiers escaped during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and fled in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
122Kg 25:5 But the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah, captured him in the plains near Jericho, and all his soldiers deserted him. 
122Kg 25:6 Zedekiah was taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
122Kg 25:7 While Zedekiah was looking on, his sons were put to death; then Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah's eyes put out, placed him in chains, and took him to Babylon. 
122Kg 25:8 On the seventh day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, Nebuzaradan, adviser to the king and commander of his army, entered Jerusalem. 
122Kg 25:9 He burned down the Temple, the palace, and the houses of all the important people in Jerusalem, 
122Kg 25:10 and his soldiers tore down the city walls. 
122Kg 25:11 Then Nebuzaradan took away to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, the remaining skilled workers, and those who had deserted to the Babylonians. 
122Kg 25:12 But he left in Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and put them to work in the vineyards and fields. 
122Kg 25:13 The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze columns and the carts that were in the Temple, together with the large bronze tank, and they took all the bronze to Babylon. 
122Kg 25:14 They also took away the shovels and the ash containers used in cleaning the altar, the tools used in tending the lamps, the bowls used for catching the blood from the sacrifices, the bowls used for burning incense, and all the other bronze articles used in the Temple service. 
122Kg 25:15 They took away everything that was made of gold or silver, including the small bowls and the pans used for carrying live coals. 
122Kg 25:16 The bronze objects that King Solomon had made for the Temple - the two columns, the carts, and the large tank - were too heavy to weigh. 
122Kg 25:17 The two columns were identical�� each one was 27 feet high, with a bronze capital on top, 4 1/2 feet high. All around each capital was a bronze grillwork decorated with pomegranates made of bronze. 
122Kg 25:18 In addition, Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners Seraiah the High Priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three other important Temple officials. 
122Kg 25:19 From the city he took the officer who had been in command of the troops, five of the king's personal advisers who were still in the city, the commander's assistant, who was in charge of military records, and sixty other important men. 
122Kg 25:20 Nebuzaradan took them to the king of Babylonia, who was in the city of Riblah 
122Kg 25:21 in the territory of Hamath. There the king had them beaten and put to death. So the people of Judah were carried away from their land into exile. 
122Kg 25:22 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, governor of Judah, and placed him in charge of all those who had not been taken away to Babylonia. 
122Kg 25:23 When the Judean officers and soldiers who had not surrendered heard about this, they joined Gedaliah at Mizpah. These officers were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth from the town of Netophah, and Jezaniah from Maacah. 
122Kg 25:24 Gedaliah said to them, "I give you my word that there is no need for you to be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Settle in this land, serve the king of Babylonia, and all will go well with you." 
122Kg 25:25 But in the seventh month of that year, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, a member of the royal family, went to Mizpah with ten men, attacked Gedaliah, and killed him. He also killed the Israelites and Babylonians who were there with him. 
122Kg 25:26 Then all the Israelites, rich and poor alike, together with the army officers, left and went to Egypt, because they were afraid of the Babylonians. 
122Kg 25:27 In the year that Evilmerodach became king of Babylonia, he showed kindness to King Jehoiachin of Judah by releasing him from prison. This happened on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin had been taken away as prisoner. 
122Kg 25:28 Evilmerodach treated him kindly and gave him a position of greater honor than he gave the other kings who were exiles with him in Babylonia. 
122Kg 25:29 So Jehoiachin was permitted to change from his prison clothes and to dine at the king's table for the rest of his life. 
122Kg 25:30 Each day, for as long as he lived, he was given a regular allowance for his needs.

131Ch 5:21 They captured from the enemy 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys, and took 100,000 prisoners of war.

131Ch 10:1 The Philistines fought a battle against the Israelites on Mount Gilboa. Many Israelites were killed there, and the rest of them, including King Saul and his sons, fled. 
131Ch 10:2 But the Philistines caught up with them and killed three of Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
131Ch 10:3 The fighting was heavy around Saul, and he was hit by enemy arrows and badly wounded. 
131Ch 10:4 He said to the young man carrying his weapons, "Draw your sword and kill me, to keep these godless Philistines from gloating over me." But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it. 
131Ch 10:5 The young man saw that Saul was dead, so he too threw himself on his sword and died. 
131Ch 10:6 So Saul and his three sons all died together, and none of his descendants ever ruled. 
131Ch 10:7 When the Israelites who lived in Jezreel Valley heard that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and ran off. Then the Philistines came and occupied them. 
131Ch 10:8 The day after the battle the Philistines went to plunder the corpses, and they found the bodies of Saul and his sons lying on Mount Gilboa. 
131Ch 10:9 They cut off Saul's head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers with them throughout Philistia to tell the good news to their idols and to their people. 
131Ch 10:10 They put his weapons in one of their temples and hung his head in the temple of their god Dagon. 
131Ch 10:11 When the people of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
131Ch 10:12 the bravest men went and got the bodies of Saul and his sons and took them to Jabesh. They buried them there under an oak and fasted for seven days. 
131Ch 10:13 Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD. He disobeyed the LORD's commands; he tried to find guidance by consulting the spirits of the dead 
131Ch 10:14 instead of consulting the LORD. So the LORD killed him and gave control of the kingdom to David son of Jesse. 
131Ch 11:1 All the people of Israel went to David at Hebron and said to him, "We are your own flesh and blood. 
131Ch 11:2 In the past, even when Saul was still our king, you led the people of Israel in battle, and the LORD your God promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler." 
131Ch 11:3 So all the leaders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them, they anointed him, and he became king of Israel, just as the LORD had promised through Samuel. 
131Ch 11:4 King David and all the Israelites went and attacked the city of Jerusalem. It was then known as Jebus, and the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land, were still living there. 
131Ch 11:5 The Jebusites told David he would never get inside the city, but David captured their fortress of Zion, and it became known as "David's City." 
131Ch 11:6 David said, "The first man to kill a Jebusite will be commander of the army!" Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, led the attack and became commander. 
131Ch 11:7 Because David went to live in the fortress, it came to be called "David's City." 
131Ch 11:8 He rebuilt the city, starting at the place where land was filled in on the east side of the hill, and Joab restored the rest of the city. 
131Ch 11:9 David grew stronger and stronger, because the LORD Almighty was with him. 
131Ch 11:10 This is the list of David's famous soldiers. Together with the rest of the people of Israel, they helped him become king, as the LORD had promised, and they kept his kingdom strong. 
131Ch 11:11 First was Jashobeam of the clan of Hachmon, the leader of "The Three." He fought with his spear against three hundred men and killed them all in one battle. 
131Ch 11:12 Next among the famous "Three" was Eleazar son of Dodo, of the clan of Ahoh. 
131Ch 11:13 He fought on David's side against the Philistines at the battle of Pas Dammim. He was in a barley field when the Israelites started to run away, 
131Ch 11:14 so he and his men took a stand in the middle of the field and fought the Philistines. The LORD gave him a great victory. 
131Ch 11:15 One day three of the thirty leading soldiers went to a rock where David was staying near Adullam Cave, while a band of Philistines was camping in Rephaim Valley. 
131Ch 11:16 At that time David was on a fortified hill, and a group of Philistines had occupied Bethlehem. 
131Ch 11:17 David got homesick and said, "How I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem!" 
131Ch 11:18 The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp, drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it; instead he poured it out as an offering to the LORD 
131Ch 11:19 and said, "I could never drink this! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives!" So he refused to drink it. These were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers. 
131Ch 11:20 Joab's brother Abishai was the leader of "The Famous Thirty." He fought with his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and became famous among "The Thirty." 
131Ch 11:21 He was the most famous of "The Thirty" and became their leader, but he was not as famous as "The Three." 
131Ch 11:22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel was a famous soldier; he did many brave deeds, including killing two great Moabite warriors. He once went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
131Ch 11:23 He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man seven and a half feet tall, who was armed with a gigantic spear. Benaiah attacked him with a club, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with it. 
131Ch 11:24 Those were the brave deeds of Benaiah, who was one of "The Thirty." 
131Ch 11:25 He was outstanding among "The Thirty," but not as famous as "The Three." David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

131Ch 12:13 Jeremiah, and Machbannai.
131Ch 12:14 Some of these men from the tribe of Gad were senior officers in command of a thousand men, and others were junior officers in command of a hundred. 
131Ch 12:15 In the first month of one year, the time when the Jordan River overflowed its banks, they crossed the river, scattering the people who lived in the valleys both east and west of the river. 
131Ch 12:16 Once a group of men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah went out to the fort where David was. 
131Ch 12:17 David went to meet them and said, "If you are coming as friends to help me, you are welcome here. Join us! But if you intend to betray me to my enemies, even though I have not tried to hurt you, the God of our ancestors will know it and punish you." 
131Ch 12:18 God's spirit took control of one of them, Amasai, who later became the commander of "The Thirty," and he called out, "David son of Jesse, we are yours! Success to you and those who help you! God is on your side." David welcomed them and made them officers in his army. 
131Ch 12:19 Some soldiers from the tribe of Manasseh went over to David's side when he was marching out with the Philistines to fight King Saul. Actually he did not help the Philistines, for their kings were afraid that he would betray them to his former master Saul, so they sent him back to Ziklag. 
131Ch 12:20 These are the soldiers from Manasseh who went over to David's side when he was returning�� Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. In Manasseh they had all commanded units of a thousand men. 
131Ch 12:21 They served David as officers over his troops, because they were all outstanding soldiers. Later they were officers in the Israelite army. 
131Ch 12:22 Almost every day new men joined David's forces, so that his army was soon enormous. 
131Ch 12:23 When David was at Hebron, many trained soldiers joined his army to help make him king in place of Saul, as the LORD had promised. Their numbers were as follows��
131Ch 12:24 Judah�� 6,800 well-equipped men, armed with shields and spears;
131Ch 12:25 Simeon�� 7,100 well-trained men; 
131Ch 12:26 Levi�� 4,600 men;
131Ch 12:27 Followers of Jehoiada, descendant of Aaron�� 3,700 men; 
131Ch 12:28 Relatives of Zadok, an able young fighter�� 22 leading men;
131Ch 12:29 Benjamin (Saul's own tribe)�� 3,000 men (most of the people of Benjamin had remained loyal to Saul);
131Ch 12:30 Ephraim�� 20,800 men famous in their own clans;
131Ch 12:31 West Manasseh�� 18,000 men chosen to go and make David king;
131Ch 12:32 Issachar�� 200 leaders, together with the men under their command (these leaders knew what Israel should do and the best time to do it);
131Ch 12:33 Zebulun�� 50,000 loyal and reliable men ready to fight, trained to use all kinds of weapons;
131Ch 12:34 Naphtali�� 1,000 leaders, together with 37,000 men armed with shields and spears;
131Ch 12:35 Dan�� 28,600 trained men; 
131Ch 12:36 Asher�� 40,000 men ready for battle; 
131Ch 12:37 Tribes east of the Jordan - Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh�� 120,000 men trained to use all kinds of weapons.
131Ch 12:38 All these soldiers, ready for battle, went to Hebron, determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the people of Israel were united in the same purpose. 
131Ch 12:39 They spent three days there with David, feasting on the food and drink which their relatives had prepared for them. 
131Ch 12:40 From as far away as the northern tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, people came bringing donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen loaded with food - flour, figs, raisins, wine, and olive oil. They also brought cattle and sheep to kill and eat. All this was an expression of the joy that was felt throughout the whole country. 
131Ch 13:1 King David consulted with all the officers in command of units of a thousand men and units of a hundred men. 
131Ch 13:2 Then he announced to all the people of Israel, "If you give your approval and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send messengers to the rest of our people and to the priests and Levites in their towns, and tell them to assemble here with us. 
131Ch 13:3 Then we will go and get God's Covenant Box, which was ignored while Saul was king." 
131Ch 13:4 The people were pleased with the suggestion and agreed to it. 
131Ch 13:5 So David assembled the people of Israel from all over the country, from the Egyptian border in the south to Hamath Pass in the north, in order to bring the Covenant Box from Kiriath Jearim to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 13:6 David and the people went to the city of Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, in the territory of Judah, to get the Covenant Box of God, which bears the name of the LORD enthroned above the winged creatures. 
131Ch 13:7 At Abinadab's house they brought out the Covenant Box and put it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio guided the cart, 
131Ch 13:8 while David and all the people danced with all their might to honor God. They sang and played musical instruments - harps, drums, cymbals, and trumpets. 
131Ch 13:9 As they came to the threshing place of Chidon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Covenant Box. 
131Ch 13:10 At once the LORD became angry with Uzzah and killed him for touching the Box. He died there in God's presence, 
131Ch 13:11 and so that place has been called Perez Uzzah ever since. David was furious because the LORD had punished Uzzah in anger. 
131Ch 13:12 Then David was afraid of God and said, "How can I take the Covenant Box with me now?" 
131Ch 13:13 So David did not take it with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he left it at the house of a man named Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath. 
131Ch 13:14 It stayed there three months, and the LORD blessed Obed Edom's family and everything that belonged to him. 
131Ch 14:1 King Hiram of Tyre sent a trade mission to David; he provided him with cedar logs and with stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace. 
131Ch 14:2 And so David realized that the LORD had established him as king of Israel and was making his kingdom prosperous for the sake of his people. 
131Ch 14:3 There in Jerusalem, David married more wives and had more sons and daughters. 
131Ch 14:4 The following children were born to him in Jerusalem�� Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
131Ch 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
131Ch 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
131Ch 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 
131Ch 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had now been made king over the whole country of Israel, their army went out to capture him. So David marched out to meet them. 
131Ch 14:9 The Philistines arrived at Rephaim Valley and began plundering. 
131Ch 14:10 David asked God, "Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give me the victory?" The LORD answered, "Yes, attack! I will give you the victory!" 
131Ch 14:11 So David attacked them at Baal Perazim and defeated them. He said, "God has used me to break through the enemy army like a flood." So that place is called Baal Perazim. 
131Ch 14:12 When the Philistines fled, they left their idols behind, and David gave orders for them to be burned. 
131Ch 14:13 Soon the Philistines returned to the valley and started plundering it again. 
131Ch 14:14 Once more David consulted God, who answered, "Don't attack them from here, but go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees. 
131Ch 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the treetops, then attack, because I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army." 
131Ch 14:16 David did what God had commanded, and so he drove the Philistines back from Gibeon all the way to Gezer. 
131Ch 14:17 David's fame spread everywhere, and the LORD made every nation afraid of him. 
131Ch 15:1 For his own use, David built houses in David's City. He also prepared a place for God's Covenant Box and put up a tent for it. 
131Ch 15:2 Then he said, "Only Levites should carry the Covenant Box, because they are the ones the LORD chose to carry it and to serve him forever." 
131Ch 15:3 So David summoned all the people of Israel to Jerusalem in order to bring the Covenant Box to the place he had prepared for it. 
131Ch 15:4 Next he sent for the descendants of Aaron and for the Levites. 
131Ch 15:5 From the Levite clan of Kohath came Uriel, in charge of 120 members of his clan; 
131Ch 15:6 from the clan of Merari came Asaiah, in charge of 220; 
131Ch 15:7 from the clan of Gershon, Joel, in charge of 130; 
131Ch 15:8 from the clan of Elizaphan, Shemaiah, in charge of 200; 
131Ch 15:9 from the clan of Hebron, Eliel, in charge of 80; 
131Ch 15:10 and from the clan of Uzziel, Amminadab, in charge of 112. 
131Ch 15:11 David called in the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the six Levites, Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
131Ch 15:12 He said to the Levites, "You are the leaders of the Levite clans. Purify yourselves and your fellow Levites, so that you can bring the Covenant Box of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it. 
131Ch 15:13 Because you were not there to carry it the first time, the LORD our God punished us for not worshiping him as we should have done." 
131Ch 15:14 Then the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to move the Covenant Box of the LORD God of Israel. 
131Ch 15:15 The Levites carried it on poles on their shoulders, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
131Ch 15:16 David commanded the leaders of the Levites to assign various Levites to sing and to play joyful music on harps and cymbals. 
131Ch 15:17 From the clans of singers they chose the following men to play the brass cymbals�� Heman son of Joel, his relative Asaph son of Berechiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah, of the clan of Merari. To assist them they chose the following Levites to play the high-pitched harps��
131Ch 15:18 Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah. 
131Ch 15:19 To play the low-pitched harps they chose the following Levites��
131Ch 15:20 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Azaziah, 
131Ch 15:21 and the Temple guards, Obed Edom and Jeiel.
131Ch 15:22 Because of his skill in music Chenaniah was chosen to be in charge of the levitical musicians. 
131Ch 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah, along with Obed Edom and Jehiah, were chosen as guards for the Covenant Box. 
131Ch 15:24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were chosen to blow trumpets in front of the Covenant Box. 
131Ch 15:25 So King David, the leaders of Israel, and the military commanders went to the house of Obed Edom to get the Covenant Box, and they had a great celebration. 
131Ch 15:26 They sacrificed seven bulls and seven sheep, to make sure that God would help the Levites who were carrying the Covenant Box. 
131Ch 15:27 David was wearing a robe made of the finest linen, and so were the musicians, Chenaniah their leader, and the Levites who carried the Box. David also wore a linen ephod. 
131Ch 15:28 So all the Israelites accompanied the Covenant Box up to Jerusalem with shouts of joy, the sound of trumpets, horns, and cymbals, and the music of harps. 
131Ch 15:29 As the Box was being brought into the city, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and leaping for joy, and she was disgusted with him. 
131Ch 16:1 They took the Covenant Box to the tent which David had prepared for it and put it inside. Then they offered sacrifices and fellowship offerings to God. 
131Ch 16:2 After David had finished offering the sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD 
131Ch 16:3 and distributed food to them all. He gave each man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a piece of roasted meat, and some raisins. 
131Ch 16:4 David appointed some of the Levites to lead the worship of the LORD, the God of Israel, in front of the Covenant Box, by singing and praising him. 
131Ch 16:5 Asaph was appointed leader, with Zechariah as his assistant. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed Edom, and Jeiel were to play harps. Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
131Ch 16:6 and two priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, were to blow trumpets regularly in front of the Covenant Box. 
131Ch 16:7 It was then that David first gave Asaph and the other Levites the responsibility for singing praises to the LORD. 
131Ch 16:8 Give thanks to the LORD, proclaim his greatness; tell the nations what he has done. 
131Ch 16:9 Sing praise to the LORD; tell the wonderful things he has done. 
131Ch 16:10 Be glad that we belong to him; let all who worship him rejoice! 
131Ch 16:11 Go to the LORD for help, and worship him continually. 
131Ch 16:12 You descendants of Jacob, God's servant, descendants of Israel, whom God chose, 
131Ch 16:13 remember the miracles that God performed and the judgments that he gave. 
131Ch 16:14 The LORD is our God; his commands are for all the world. 
131Ch 16:15 Never forget God's covenant, which he made to last forever, 
131Ch 16:16 the covenant he made with Abraham, the promise he made to Isaac. 
131Ch 16:17 The LORD made a covenant with Jacob, one that will last forever. 
131Ch 16:18 "I will give you the land of Canaan," he said. "It will be your own possession." 
131Ch 16:19 God's people were few in number, strangers in the land of Canaan. 
131Ch 16:20 They wandered from country to country, from one kingdom to another. 
131Ch 16:21 But God let no one oppress them; to protect them, he warned the kings��
131Ch 16:22 "Don't harm my chosen servants; do not touch my prophets." 
131Ch 16:23 Sing to the LORD, all the world! Proclaim every day the good news that he has saved us. 
131Ch 16:24 Proclaim his glory to the nations, his mighty deeds to all peoples. 
131Ch 16:25 The LORD is great and is to be highly praised; he is to be honored more than all the gods. 
131Ch 16:26 The gods of all other nations are only idols, but the LORD created the heavens. 
131Ch 16:27 Glory and majesty surround him, power and joy fill his Temple. 
131Ch 16:28 Praise the LORD, all people on earth, praise his glory and might. 
131Ch 16:29 Praise the LORD's glorious name; bring an offering and come into his Temple. Bow down before the Holy One when he appears; 
131Ch 16:30 tremble before him, all the earth! The earth is set firmly in place and cannot be moved. 
131Ch 16:31 Be glad, earth and sky! Tell the nations that the LORD is king. 
131Ch 16:32 Roar, sea, and every creature in you; be glad, fields, and everything in you! 
131Ch 16:33 The trees in the woods will shout for joy when the LORD comes to rule the earth. 
131Ch 16:34 Give thanks to the LORD, because he is good; his love is eternal. 
131Ch 16:35 Say to him, "Save us, O God our Savior; gather us together; rescue us from the nations, so that we may be thankful and praise your holy name." 
131Ch 16:36 Praise the LORD, the God of Israel! Praise him now and forever! Then all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. 
131Ch 16:37 King David put Asaph and the other Levites in permanent charge of the worship that was held at the place where the Covenant Box was kept. They were to perform their duties there day by day. 
131Ch 16:38 Obed Edom son of Jeduthun and sixty-eight men of his clan were to assist them. Hosah and Obed Edom were in charge of guarding the gates. 
131Ch 16:39 Zadok the priest and his fellow priests, however, were in charge of the worship of the LORD at the place of worship in Gibeon. 
131Ch 16:40 Every morning and evening they were to burn sacrifices whole on the altar in accordance with what was written in the Law which the LORD gave to Israel. 
131Ch 16:41 There with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the others who were specifically chosen to sing praises to the LORD for his eternal love. 
131Ch 16:42 Heman and Jeduthun also had charge of the trumpets and cymbals and the other instruments which were played when the songs of praise were sung. The members of Jeduthun's clan were in charge of guarding the gates. 
131Ch 16:43 Then everyone went home, and David went home to spend some time with his family. 
131Ch 17:1 King David was now living in his palace. One day he sent for the prophet Nathan and said to him, "Here I am living in a house built of cedar, but the LORD's Covenant Box is kept in a tent!" 
131Ch 17:2 Nathan answered, "Do whatever you have in mind, because God is with you." 
131Ch 17:3 But that night God said to Nathan, 
131Ch 17:4 "Go and tell my servant David that I say to him, 'You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in. 
131Ch 17:5 From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now I have never lived in a temple; I have always lived in tents and moved from place to place. 
131Ch 17:6 In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.' 
131Ch 17:7 "So tell my servant David that I, the LORD Almighty, say to him, 'I took you from looking after sheep in the fields and made you the ruler of my people Israel. 
131Ch 17:8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have defeated all your enemies as you advanced. I will make you as famous as the greatest leaders in the world. 
131Ch 17:9 I have chosen a place for my people Israel and have settled them there, where they will live without being oppressed any more. Ever since they entered this land they have been attacked by violent people, but this will not happen again. 
131Ch 17:10 I promise to defeat all your enemies and to give you descendants. 
131Ch 17:11 When you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will make one of your sons king and will keep his kingdom strong. 
131Ch 17:12 He will be the one to build a temple for me, and I will make sure that his dynasty continues forever. 
131Ch 17:13 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not withdraw my support from him as I did from Saul, whom I removed so that you could be king. 
131Ch 17:14 I will put him in charge of my people and my kingdom forever. His dynasty will never end.' " 
131Ch 17:15 Nathan told David everything that God had revealed to him. 
131Ch 17:16 Then King David went into the Tent of the LORD's presence, sat down, and prayed, "I am not worthy of what you have already done for me, LORD God, nor is my family. 
131Ch 17:17 Yet now you are doing even more; you have made promises about my descendants in the years to come, and you, LORD God, are already treating me like someone great. 
131Ch 17:18 What more can I say to you! You know me well, and yet you honor me, your servant. 
131Ch 17:19 It was your will and purpose to do this for me and to show me my future greatness. 
131Ch 17:20 LORD, there is none like you; we have always known that you alone are God. 
131Ch 17:21 There is no other nation on earth like Israel, whom you rescued from slavery to make them your own people. The great and wonderful things you did for them spread your fame throughout the world. You rescued your people from Egypt and drove out other nations as your people advanced. 
131Ch 17:22 You have made Israel your own people forever, and you, LORD, have become their God. 
131Ch 17:23 "And now, O LORD, fulfill for all time the promise you made about me and my descendants, and do what you said you would. 
131Ch 17:24 Your fame will be great, and people will forever say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel.' And you will preserve my dynasty for all time. 
131Ch 17:25 I have the courage to pray this prayer to you, my God, because you have revealed all this to me, your servant, and have told me that you will make my descendants kings. 
131Ch 17:26 You, LORD, are God, and you have made this wonderful promise to me. 
131Ch 17:27 I ask you to bless my descendants so that they will continue to enjoy your favor. You, LORD, have blessed them, and your blessing will rest on them forever." 
131Ch 18:1 Some time later King David attacked the Philistines again and defeated them. He took out of their control the city of Gath and its surrounding villages. 
131Ch 18:2 He also defeated the Moabites, who became his subjects and paid taxes to him. 
131Ch 18:3 Next, David attacked King Hadadezer of the Syrian state of Zobah, near the territory of Hamath, because Hadadezer was trying to gain control of the territory by the upper Euphrates River. 
131Ch 18:4 David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand cavalry troops, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled all the rest. 
131Ch 18:5 When the Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer, David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men. 
131Ch 18:6 Then he set up military camps in their territory, and they became his subjects and paid taxes to him. The LORD made David victorious everywhere. 
131Ch 18:7 David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 18:8 He also took a great quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Kun, cities ruled by Hadadezer. (Solomon later used this bronze to make the tank, the columns, and the bronze utensils for the Temple.) 
131Ch 18:9 King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated Hadadezer's entire army. 
131Ch 18:10 So he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for his victory over Hadadezer, against whom Toi had fought many times. Joram brought David presents made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
131Ch 18:11 King David dedicated them for use in worship, along with the silver and gold he took from the nations he conquered - Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek. 
131Ch 18:12 Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, defeated the Edomites in Salt Valley and killed eighteen thousand of them. 
131Ch 18:13 He set up military camps throughout Edom, and the people there became King David's subjects. The LORD made David victorious everywhere. 
131Ch 18:14 David ruled over all Israel and made sure that his people were always treated fairly and justly. 
131Ch 18:15 Abishai's brother Joab was commander of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
131Ch 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was court secretary; 
131Ch 18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; and King David's sons held high positions in his service. 
131Ch 19:1 Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
131Ch 19:2 King David said, "I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me." So David sent messengers to express his sympathy. When they arrived in Ammon and called on King Hanun, 
131Ch 19:3 the Ammonite leaders said to the king, "Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the land, so that he can conquer it!" 
131Ch 19:4 Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away. 
131Ch 19:5 They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again. 
131Ch 19:6 King Hanun and the Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they paid nearly forty tons of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Upper Mesopotamia and from the Syrian states of Maacah and Zobah. 
131Ch 19:7 The thirty-two thousand chariots they hired and the army of the king of Maacah came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites too came out from all their cities and got ready to fight. 
131Ch 19:8 When David heard what was happening, he sent out Joab and the whole army. 
131Ch 19:9 The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, and the kings who had come to help took up their position in the open countryside. 
131Ch 19:10 Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians. 
131Ch 19:11 He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites. 
131Ch 19:12 Joab said to him, "If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you. 
131Ch 19:13 Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD's will be done." 
131Ch 19:14 Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled. 
131Ch 19:15 When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab went back to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 19:16 The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, so they brought troops from the Syrian states on the east side of the Euphrates River and placed them under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
131Ch 19:17 When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and put them in position facing the Syrians. The fighting began, 
131Ch 19:18 and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven thousand Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand foot soldiers. They also killed the Syrian commander, Shobach. 
131Ch 19:19 When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. {\cf2 (19:20) The Syrians were never again willing to help the Ammonites.
131Ch 20:1 The following spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, Joab led out the army and invaded the land of Ammon; King David, however, stayed in Jerusalem. They besieged the city of Rabbah, attacked it, and destroyed it. 
131Ch 20:2 The Ammonite idol Molech had a gold crown which weighed about seventy-five pounds. In it there was a jewel, which David took and put in his own crown. He also took a large amount of loot from the city. 
131Ch 20:3 He took the people of the city and put them to work with saws, iron hoes, and axes. He did the same to the people of all the other towns of Ammon. Then he and his men returned to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 20:4 Later on, war broke out again with the Philistines at Gezer. This was when Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Sippai, and the Philistines were defeated. 
131Ch 20:5 There was another battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath from Gath, whose spear had a shaft as thick as the bar on a weaver's loom. 
131Ch 20:6 Another battle took place at Gath, where there was a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was a descendant of the ancient giants. 
131Ch 20:7 He defied the Israelites, and Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shammah, killed him. 
131Ch 20:8 These three, who were killed by David and his men, were descendants of the giants at Gath. 
131Ch 21:1 Satan wanted to bring trouble on the people of Israel, so he made David decide to take a census. 
131Ch 21:2 David gave orders to Joab and the other officers, "Go through Israel, from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are." 
131Ch 21:3 Joab answered, "May the LORD make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now! Your Majesty, they are all your servants. Why do you want to do this and make the whole nation guilty?" 
131Ch 21:4 But the king made Joab obey the order. Joab went out, traveled through the whole country of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 21:5 He reported to King David the total number of men capable of military service�� 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah. 
131Ch 21:6 Because Joab disapproved of the king's command, he did not take any census of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin. 
131Ch 21:7 God was displeased with what had been done, so he punished Israel. 
131Ch 21:8 David said to God, "I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly." 
131Ch 21:9 Then the LORD said to Gad, David's prophet, 
131Ch 21:10 "Go and tell David that I am giving him three choices. I will do whichever he chooses." 
131Ch 21:11 Gad went to David, told him what the LORD had said, and asked, "Which is it to be? 
131Ch 21:12 Three years of famine? Or three months of running away from the armies of your enemies? Or three days during which the LORD attacks you with his sword and sends an epidemic on your land, using his angel to bring death throughout Israel? What answer shall I give the LORD?" 
131Ch 21:13 David replied to Gad, "I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people. Let the LORD himself be the one to punish me, because he is merciful." 
131Ch 21:14 So the LORD sent an epidemic on the people of Israel, and seventy thousand of them died. 
131Ch 21:15 Then he sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but he changed his mind and said to the angel, "Stop! That's enough!" The angel was standing by the threshing place of Araunah, a Jebusite. 
131Ch 21:16 David saw the angel standing in midair, holding his sword in his hand, ready to destroy Jerusalem. Then David and the leaders of the people - all of whom were wearing sackcloth - bowed low, with their faces touching the ground. 
131Ch 21:17 David prayed, "O God, I am the one who did wrong. I am the one who ordered the census. What have these poor people done? LORD, my God, punish me and my family, and spare your people." 
131Ch 21:18 The angel of the LORD told Gad to command David to go and build an altar to the LORD at Araunah's threshing place. 
131Ch 21:19 David obeyed the LORD's command and went, as Gad had told him to. 
131Ch 21:20 There at the threshing place Araunah and his four sons were threshing wheat, and when they saw the angel, the sons ran and hid. 
131Ch 21:21 As soon as Araunah saw King David approaching, he left the threshing place and bowed low, with his face touching the ground. 
131Ch 21:22 David said to him, "Sell me your threshing place, so that I can build an altar to the LORD, to stop the epidemic. I'll give you the full price." 
131Ch 21:23 "Take it, Your Majesty," Araunah said, "and do whatever you wish. Here are these oxen to burn as an offering on the altar, and here are the threshing boards to use as fuel, and wheat to give as an offering. I give it all to you." 
131Ch 21:24 But the king answered, "No, I will pay you the full price. I will not give as an offering to the LORD something that belongs to you, something that costs me nothing." 
131Ch 21:25 And he paid Araunah six hundred gold coins for the threshing place. 
131Ch 21:26 He built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He prayed, and the LORD answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn the sacrifices on the altar. 
131Ch 21:27 The LORD told the angel to put his sword away, and the angel obeyed. 
131Ch 21:28 David saw by this that the LORD had answered his prayer, so he offered sacrifices on the altar at Araunah's threshing place. 
131Ch 21:29 The Tent of the LORD's presence which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar on which sacrifices were burned were still at the place of worship at Gibeon at this time; 
131Ch 21:30 but David was not able to go there to worship God, because he was afraid of the sword of the LORD's angel. 
131Ch 22:1 So David said, "This is where the Temple of the LORD God will be. Here is the altar where the people of Israel are to offer burnt offerings." 
131Ch 22:2 King David gave orders for all the foreigners living in the land of Israel to assemble, and he put them to work. Some of them prepared stone blocks for building the Temple. 
131Ch 22:3 He supplied a large amount of iron for making nails and clamps for the wooden gates, and so much bronze that no one could weigh it. 
131Ch 22:4 He had the people of Tyre and Sidon bring him a large number of cedar logs. 
131Ch 22:5 David thought, "The Temple that my son Solomon is to build must be splendid and world-famous. But he is young and inexperienced, so I must make preparations for it." So David got large amounts of the materials ready before he died. 
131Ch 22:6 He sent for his son Solomon and commanded him to build a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel. 
131Ch 22:7 David said to him, "Son, I wanted to build a temple to honor the LORD my God. 
131Ch 22:8 But the LORD told me that I had killed too many people and fought too many wars. And so, because of all the bloodshed I have caused, he would not let me build a temple for him. 
131Ch 22:9 He did, however, make me a promise. He said, 'You will have a son who will rule in peace, because I will give him peace from all his enemies. His name will be Solomon, because during his reign I will give Israel peace and security. 
131Ch 22:10 He will build a temple for me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. His dynasty will rule Israel forever.' " 
131Ch 22:11 David continued, "Now, son, may the LORD your God be with you, and may he keep his promise to make you successful in building a temple for him. 
131Ch 22:12 And may the LORD your God give you insight and wisdom so that you may govern Israel according to his Law. 
131Ch 22:13 If you obey all the laws which the LORD gave to Moses for Israel, you will be successful. Be determined and confident, and don't let anything make you afraid. 
131Ch 22:14 As for the Temple, by my efforts I have accumulated almost four thousand tons of gold and nearly forty thousand tons of silver to be used in building it. Besides that, there is an unlimited supply of bronze and iron. I also have wood and stone ready, but you must get more. 
131Ch 22:15 You have many workers. There are stonecutters to work in the quarries, and there are masons and carpenters, as well as a large number of skilled workers of every sort who can work 
131Ch 22:16 with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you." 
131Ch 22:17 David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon. 
131Ch 22:18 He said, "The LORD your God has been with you and given you peace on all sides. He let me conquer all the people who used to live in this land, and they are now subject to you and to the LORD. 
131Ch 22:19 Now serve the LORD your God with all your heart and soul. Start building the Temple, so that you can place in it the Covenant Box of the LORD and all the other sacred objects used in worshiping him." 
131Ch 23:1 When David was very old, he made his son Solomon king of Israel. 
131Ch 23:2 King David brought together all the Israelite leaders and all the priests and Levites. 
131Ch 23:3 He took a census of all the male Levites aged thirty or older. The total was thirty-eight thousand. 
131Ch 23:4 The king assigned twenty-four thousand to administer the work of the Temple, six thousand to keep records and decide disputes, 
131Ch 23:5 four thousand to do guard duty, and four thousand to praise the LORD, using the musical instruments provided by the king for this purpose. 
131Ch 23:6 David divided the Levites into three groups, according to their clans�� Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
131Ch 23:7 Gershon had two sons�� Ladan and Shimei. 
131Ch 23:8 Ladan had three sons�� Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel, 
131Ch 23:9 who were the heads of the clans descended from Ladan. (Shimei had three sons�� Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.) 
131Ch 23:10 Shimei had four sons�� Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah, in order of age. 
131Ch 23:11 Jeush and Beriah did not have many descendants, so they were counted as one clan. 
131Ch 23:12 Kohath had four sons�� Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
131Ch 23:13 His oldest son, Amram, was the father of Aaron and Moses. (Aaron and his descendants were set apart to be in charge of the sacred objects forever, to burn incense in the worship of the LORD, to serve him, and to bless the people in his name. 
131Ch 23:14 But the sons of Moses, the man of God, were included among the Levites.) 
131Ch 23:15 Moses had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. 
131Ch 23:16 The leader among Gershom's sons was Shebuel. 
131Ch 23:17 Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, but Rehabiah had many descendants. 
131Ch 23:18 Kohath's second son, Izhar, had a son, Shelomith, the head of the clan. 
131Ch 23:19 Kohath's third son, Hebron, had four sons�� Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam. 
131Ch 23:20 Kohath's fourth son, Uzziel, had two sons, Micah and Isshiah. 
131Ch 23:21 Merari had two sons, Mahli and Mushi. Mahli also had two sons, Eleazar and Kish, 
131Ch 23:22 but Eleazar died without having any sons, only daughters. His daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish. 
131Ch 23:23 Merari's second son, Mushi, had three sons�� Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth. 
131Ch 23:24 These were the descendants of Levi, by clans and families, every one of them registered by name. Each of his descendants, twenty years of age or older, had a share in the work of the LORD's Temple. 
131Ch 23:25 David said, "The LORD God of Israel has given peace to his people, and he himself will live in Jerusalem forever. 
131Ch 23:26 So there is no longer any need for the Levites to carry the Tent of the LORD's presence and all the equipment used in worship." 
131Ch 23:27 On the basis of David's final instructions all Levites were registered for service when they reached the age of twenty, 
131Ch 23:28 and were assigned the following duties�� to help the priests descended from Aaron with the Temple worship, to take care of its courtyards and its rooms, and to keep undefiled everything that is sacred; 
131Ch 23:29 to be responsible for the bread offered to God, the flour used in offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the baked offerings, and the flour mixed with olive oil; to weigh and measure the Temple offerings; 
131Ch 23:30 and to praise and glorify the LORD every morning and every evening 
131Ch 23:31 and whenever offerings to the LORD are burned on the Sabbath, the New Moon Festival, and other festivals. Rules were made specifying the number of Levites assigned to do this work each time. The Levites were assigned the duty of worshiping the LORD for all time. 
131Ch 23:32 They were given the responsibility of taking care of the Tent of the LORD's presence and the Temple, and of assisting their relatives, the priests descended from Aaron, in the Temple worship. 
131Ch 24:1 These are the groups to which the descendants of Aaron belong. Aaron had four sons�� Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
131Ch 24:2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and left no descendants, so their brothers Eleazar and Ithamar became priests. 
131Ch 24:3 King David organized the descendants of Aaron into groups according to their duties. He was assisted in this by Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and by Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar. 
131Ch 24:4 The descendants of Eleazar were organized into sixteen groups, while the descendants of Ithamar were organized into eight; this was done because there were more male heads of families among the descendants of Eleazar. 
131Ch 24:5 Since there were Temple officials and spiritual leaders among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar, assignments were made by drawing lots. 
131Ch 24:6 The descendants of Eleazar and of Ithamar took turns drawing lots. Then they were registered by Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite secretary. The king, his officials, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of the priestly families and of the Levite families, were all witnesses. 
131Ch 24:7 This is the order in which the twenty-four family groups were given their assignments�� 1) Jehoiarib; 2) Jedaiah; 
131Ch 24:8 3) Harim; 4) Seorim; 
131Ch 24:9 5) Malchijah; 6) Mijamin;

131Ch 24:16 19) Pethahiah; 20) Jehezkel; 
131Ch 24:17 21) Jachin; 22) Gamul; 
131Ch 24:18 23) Delaiah; 24) Maaziah. 
131Ch 24:19 These men were registered according to their assignments for going to the Temple and performing the duties established by their ancestor Aaron in obedience to the commands of the LORD God of Israel. 
131Ch 24:20 These are other heads of families descended from Levi�� Jehdeiah, a descendant of Amram through Shebuel; 
131Ch 24:21 Isshiah, a descendant of Rehabiah; 
131Ch 24:22 Jahath, a descendant of Izhar through Shelomith; 
131Ch 24:23 Jeriah, Amariah, Jehaziel, and Jekameam, sons of Hebron, in order of age; 
131Ch 24:24 Shamir, a descendant of Uzziel through Micah; 
131Ch 24:25 Zechariah, a descendant of Uzziel through Isshiah, Micah's brother; 
131Ch 24:26 Mahli, Mushi, and Jaaziah, descendants of Merari. 
131Ch 24:27 Jaaziah had three sons�� Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 
131Ch 24:28 Mahli had two sons, Eleazar and Kish.
131Ch 24:29 Eleazar had no sons, but Kish had one son, Jerahmeel.
131Ch 24:30 Mushi had three sons�� Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth. These are the families of the Levites. 
131Ch 24:31 The head of each family and one of his younger brothers drew lots for their assignments, just as their relatives, the priests descended from Aaron, had done. King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites were witnesses. 
131Ch 25:1 King David and the leaders of the Levites chose the following Levite clans to lead the worship services�� Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. They were to proclaim God's messages, accompanied by the music of harps and cymbals. This is the list of persons chosen to lead the worship, with the type of service that each group performed��
131Ch 25:2 The four sons of Asaph�� Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. They were under the direction of Asaph, who proclaimed God's messages whenever the king commanded. 
131Ch 25:3 The six sons of Jeduthun�� Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. Under the direction of their father they proclaimed God's message, accompanied by the music of harps, and sang praise and thanks to the LORD.

131Ch 25:5 God gave to Heman, the king's prophet, these fourteen sons and also three daughters, as he had promised, in order to give power to Heman. 
131Ch 25:6 All of his sons played cymbals and harps under their father's direction, to accompany the Temple worship. And Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under orders from the king. 
131Ch 25:7 All these twenty-four men were experts; and their fellow Levites were trained musicians. There were 288 men in all. 
131Ch 25:8 To determine the assignment of duties they all drew lots, whether they were young or old, experts or beginners. 
131Ch 25:9 These 288 men were divided according to families into twenty-four groups of twelve, with a leader in charge of each group. This is the order in which they were on duty�� 1) Joseph of the family of Asaph; 2) Gedaliah; 
131Ch 25:10 3) Zaccur;

131Ch 26:1 These are the assignments of work for the Levites who served as Temple guards. From the clan of Korah there was Meshelemiah son of Kore, of the family of Asaph. 
131Ch 26:2 He had seven sons, listed in order of age�� Zechariah, Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,

131Ch 26:9 Meshelemiah's family furnished eighteen qualified men. 
131Ch 26:10 From the clan of Merari there was Hosah, who had four sons�� Shimri (his father made him the leader, even though he was not the oldest son), 
131Ch 26:11 Hilkiah, Tebaliah, and Zechariah. In all there were thirteen members of Hosah's family who were Temple guards. 
131Ch 26:12 The Temple guards were divided into groups, according to families, and they were assigned duties in the Temple, just as the other Levites were. 
131Ch 26:13 Each family, regardless of size, drew lots to see which gate it would be responsible for. 
131Ch 26:14 Shelemiah drew the east gate, and his son Zechariah, a man who always gave good advice, drew the north gate. 
131Ch 26:15 Obed Edom was allotted the south gate, and his sons were allotted to guard the storerooms. 
131Ch 26:16 Shuppim and Hosah were allotted the west gate and the Shallecheth Gate on the upper road. Guard duty was divided into assigned periods, one after another. 
131Ch 26:17 On the east, six guards were on duty each day, on the north, four, and on the south, four. Four guards were stationed at the storerooms daily, two at each storeroom. 
131Ch 26:18 Near the western pavilion there were four guards by the road and two at the pavilion itself. 
131Ch 26:19 This is the assignment of guard duty to the clan of Korah and the clan of Merari. 
131Ch 26:20 Others of their fellow Levites were in charge of the Temple treasury and the storerooms for gifts dedicated to God. 
131Ch 26:21 Ladan, one of the sons of Gershon, was the ancestor of several family groups, including the family of his son Jehiel.

131Ch 26:24 Shebuel, of the clan of Moses' son Gershom, was the chief official responsible for the Temple treasury.

131Ch 26:26 Shelomith and the members of his family were in charge of all the gifts dedicated to God by King David, the heads of families, leaders of clan groups, and army officers. 
131Ch 26:27 They took some of the loot they captured in battle and dedicated it for use in the Temple.

131Ch 26:32 King David chose twenty-seven hundred outstanding heads of families from Jeriah's relatives and put them in charge of administering all religious and civil matters in Israel east of the Jordan River - the territories of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh.

131Ch 27:23 King David did not take a census of the people who were under the age of twenty, because of the LORD's promise to make the people of Israel as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
131Ch 27:24 Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, began to take a census, but he did not complete it. God punished Israel because of this census, so the final figures were never recorded in King David's official records. 
131Ch 27:25 This is the list of those who administered the royal property�� Royal storerooms�� Azmaveth son of Adiel, Local storerooms�� Jonathan son of Uzziah, 
131Ch 27:26 Farm labor�� Ezri son of Chelub, 
131Ch 27:27 Vineyards�� Shimei from Ramah, Wine cellars�� Zabdi from Shepham,

131Ch 27:30 Camels�� Obil, an Ishmaelite Donkeys�� Jehdeiah from Meronoth,
131Ch 27:31 Sheep and goats�� Jaziz, a Hagrite.
131Ch 27:32 Jonathan, King David's uncle, was a skillful adviser and a scholar. He and Jehiel son of Hachmoni were in charge of the education of the king's sons. 
131Ch 27:33 Ahithophel was adviser to the king, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend and counselor. 
131Ch 27:34 After Ahithophel died, Abiathar and Jehoiada son of Benaiah became advisers. Joab was commander of the royal army. 
131Ch 28:1 King David commanded all the officials of Israel to assemble in Jerusalem. So all the officials of the tribes, the officials who administered the work of the kingdom, the leaders of the clans, the supervisors of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and his sons - indeed all the palace officials, leading soldiers, and important men - gathered in Jerusalem. 
131Ch 28:2 David stood before them and addressed them�� "My friends, listen to me. I wanted to build a permanent home for the Covenant Box, the footstool of the LORD our God. I have made preparations for building a temple to honor him, 
131Ch 28:3 but he has forbidden me to do it, because I am a soldier and have shed too much blood. 
131Ch 28:4 The LORD, the God of Israel, chose me and my descendants to rule Israel forever. He chose the tribe of Judah to provide leadership, and out of Judah he chose my father's family. From all that family it was his pleasure to take me and make me king over all Israel. 
131Ch 28:5 He gave me many sons, and out of them all he chose Solomon to rule over Israel, the LORD's kingdom. 
131Ch 28:6 "The LORD said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who will build my Temple. I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
131Ch 28:7 I will make his kingdom last forever if he continues to obey carefully all my laws and commands as he does now.' 
131Ch 28:8 "So now, my people, in the presence of our God and of this assembly of all Israel, the LORD's people, I charge you to obey carefully everything that the LORD our God has commanded us, so that you may continue to possess this good land and so that you may hand it on to succeeding generations forever." 
131Ch 28:9 And to Solomon he said, "My son, I charge you to acknowledge your father's God and to serve him with an undivided heart and a willing mind. He knows all our thoughts and desires. If you go to him, he will accept you; but if you turn away from him, he will abandon you forever. 
131Ch 28:10 You must realize that the LORD has chosen you to build his holy Temple. Now do it - and do it with determination." 
131Ch 28:11 David gave Solomon the plans for all the Temple buildings, for the storerooms and all the other rooms, and for the Most Holy Place, where sins are forgiven. 
131Ch 28:12 He also gave him the plans for all he had in mind for the courtyards and the rooms around them, and for the storerooms for the Temple equipment and the gifts dedicated to the LORD. 
131Ch 28:13 David also gave him the plans for organizing the priests and Levites to perform their duties, to do the work of the Temple, and to take care of all the Temple utensils. 
131Ch 28:14 He gave instructions as to how much silver and gold was to be used for making the utensils, 
131Ch 28:15 for each lamp and lampstand, 
131Ch 28:16 for the silver tables, and for each gold table on which were placed the loaves of bread offered to God. 
131Ch 28:17 He also gave instructions as to how much pure gold was to be used in making forks, bowls, and jars, how much silver and gold in making dishes, 
131Ch 28:18 and how much pure gold in making the altar on which incense was burned and in making the chariot for the winged creatures that spread their wings over the LORD's Covenant Box. 
131Ch 28:19 King David said, "All this is contained in the plan written according to the instructions which the LORD himself gave me to carry out." 
131Ch 28:20 King David said to his son Solomon, "Be confident and determined. Start the work and don't let anything stop you. The LORD God, whom I serve, will be with you. He will not abandon you, but he will stay with you until you finish the work to be done on his Temple. 
131Ch 28:21 The priests and the Levites have been assigned duties to perform in the Temple. Workers with every kind of skill are eager to help you, and all the people and their leaders are at your command." 
131Ch 29:1 King David announced to the whole assembly�� "My son Solomon is the one whom God has chosen, but he is still young and lacks experience. The work to be done is tremendous, because this is not a palace for people but a temple for the LORD God. 
131Ch 29:2 I have made every effort to prepare materials for the Temple - gold, silver, bronze, iron, timber, precious stones and gems, stones for mosaics, and quantities of marble. 
131Ch 29:3 Over and above all this that I have provided, I have given silver and gold from my personal property because of my love for God's Temple. 
131Ch 29:4 I have given 115 tons of the finest gold and 265 tons of pure silver for decorating the walls of the Temple 
131Ch 29:5 and for all the objects which the skilled workers are to make. Now who else is willing to give a generous offering to the LORD?" 
131Ch 29:6 Then the heads of the clans, the officials of the tribes, the commanders of the army, and the administrators of the royal property volunteered to give 
131Ch 29:7 the following for the work on the Temple�� 190 tons of gold, 380 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 3,750 tons of iron. 
131Ch 29:8 Those who had precious stones gave them to the Temple treasury, which was administered by Jehiel of the Levite clan of Gershon. 
131Ch 29:9 The people had given willingly to the LORD, and they were happy that so much had been given. King David also was extremely happy. 
131Ch 29:10 There in front of the whole assembly King David praised the LORD. He said, "LORD God of our ancestor Jacob, may you be praised forever and ever! 
131Ch 29:11 You are great and powerful, glorious, splendid, and majestic. Everything in heaven and earth is yours, and you are king, supreme ruler over all. 
131Ch 29:12 All riches and wealth come from you; you rule everything by your strength and power; and you are able to make anyone great and strong. 
131Ch 29:13 Now, our God, we give you thanks, and we praise your glorious name. 
131Ch 29:14 "Yet my people and I cannot really give you anything, because everything is a gift from you, and we have only given back what is yours already. 
131Ch 29:15 You know, O LORD, that we pass through life like exiles and strangers, as our ancestors did. Our days are like a passing shadow, and we cannot escape death. 
131Ch 29:16 O LORD, our God, we have brought together all this wealth to build a temple to honor your holy name, but it all came from you and all belongs to you. 
131Ch 29:17 I know that you test everyone's heart and are pleased with people of integrity. In honesty and sincerity I have willingly given all this to you, and I have seen how your people who are gathered here have been happy to bring offerings to you. 
131Ch 29:18 LORD God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, keep such devotion forever strong in your people's hearts and keep them always faithful to you. 
131Ch 29:19 Give my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to obey everything that you command and to build the Temple for which I have made these preparations." 
131Ch 29:20 Then David commanded the people, "Praise the LORD your God!" And the whole assembly praised the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and they bowed low and gave honor to the LORD and also to the king. 
131Ch 29:21 The following day they killed animals as sacrifices, dedicating them to the LORD, and then gave them to the people to eat. In addition, they sacrificed a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, which they burned whole on the altar. They also brought the offerings of wine. 
131Ch 29:22 So that day they were very happy as they ate and drank in the presence of the LORD. For a second time they proclaimed Solomon king. In the name of the LORD they anointed him as their ruler and Zadok as priest. 
131Ch 29:23 So Solomon succeeded his father David on the throne which the LORD had established. He was a successful king, and the whole nation of Israel obeyed him. 
131Ch 29:24 All the officials and soldiers, and even all of David's other sons, promised to be loyal to Solomon as king. 
131Ch 29:25 The LORD made the whole nation stand in awe of Solomon, and he made him more glorious than any other king that had ruled Israel. 
131Ch 29:26 David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel 
131Ch 29:27 for forty years. He ruled in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three. 
131Ch 29:28 He died at a ripe old age, wealthy and respected, and his son Solomon succeeded him as king. 
131Ch 29:29 The history of King David from beginning to end is recorded in the records of the three prophets, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. 
131Ch 29:30 The records tell how he ruled, how powerful he was, and all the things that happened to him, to Israel, and to the surrounding kingdoms. 
14
142Ch 1:1 Solomon, the son of King David, took firm control of the kingdom of Israel, and the LORD his God blessed him and made him very powerful. 
142Ch 1:2 King Solomon gave an order to all the officers in charge of units of a thousand men and of a hundred men, all the government officials, all the heads of families, and all the rest of the people, 
142Ch 1:3 commanding them to go with him to the place of worship at Gibeon. They went there because that was where the Tent of the LORD's presence was located, which Moses, the LORD's servant, had made in the wilderness. 
142Ch 1:4 (The Covenant Box, however, was in Jerusalem, kept in a tent which King David had set up when he brought the Box from Kiriath Jearim.) 
142Ch 1:5 The bronze altar which had been made by Bezalel, the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, was also in Gibeon in front of the Tent of the LORD's presence. King Solomon and all the people worshiped the LORD there. 
142Ch 1:6 In front of the Tent the king worshiped the LORD by offering sacrifices on the bronze altar; he had a thousand animals killed and burned whole on it. 
142Ch 1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon and asked, "What would you like me to give you?" 
142Ch 1:8 Solomon answered, "You always showed great love for my father David, and now you have let me succeed him as king. 
142Ch 1:9 O LORD God, fulfill the promise you made to my father. You have made me king over a people who are so many that they cannot be counted, 
142Ch 1:10 so give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?" 
142Ch 1:11 God replied to Solomon, "You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth or treasure or fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king. 
142Ch 1:12 I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again." 
142Ch 1:13 So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon, where the Tent of the LORD's presence was, and returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled over Israel. 
142Ch 1:14 He built up a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem, and the rest he stationed in various other cities. 
142Ch 1:15 During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
142Ch 1:16 The king's agents controlled the export of horses from Musri and Cilicia, 
142Ch 1:17 and the export of chariots from Egypt. They supplied the Hittite and Syrian kings with horses and chariots, selling chariots for 600 pieces of silver each and horses for 150 each. 
142Ch 2:1 King Solomon decided to build a temple where the LORD would be worshiped, and also to build a palace for himself. 
142Ch 2:2 He put 70,000 men to work transporting materials, and 80,000 to work cutting stone in the hill country. There were 3,600 others responsible for supervising the work. 
142Ch 2:3 Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre�� "Do business with me as you did with my father, King David, when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace. 
142Ch 2:4 I am building a temple to honor the LORD my God. It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices, where we will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously, and where we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other holy days honoring the LORD our God. He has commanded Israel to do this forever. 
142Ch 2:5 I intend to build a great temple, because our God is greater than any other god. 
142Ch 2:6 Yet no one can really build a temple for God, because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him. How then can I build a temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God? 
142Ch 2:7 Now send me a man with skill in engraving, in working gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in making blue, purple, and red cloth. He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected. 
142Ch 2:8 I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours 
142Ch 2:9 in preparing large quantities of timber, because this temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent. 
142Ch 2:10 As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you 100,000 bushels of wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil." 
142Ch 2:11 King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply. He wrote, "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king. 
142Ch 2:12 Praise the LORD God of Israel, Creator of heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, full of understanding and skill, who now plans to build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself. 
142Ch 2:13 I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram. 
142Ch 2:14 His mother was a member of the tribe of Dan and his father was a native of Tyre. He knows how to make things out of gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood. He can work with blue, purple, and red cloth, and with linen. He can do all sorts of engraving and can follow any design suggested to him. Let him work with your skilled workers and with those who worked for your father, King David. 
142Ch 2:15 So now send us the wheat, barley, wine, and olive oil that you promised. 
142Ch 2:16 In the mountains of Lebanon we will cut down all the cedars you need, tie them together in rafts, and float them by sea as far as Joppa. From there you can take them to Jerusalem." 
142Ch 2:17 King Solomon took a census of all the foreigners living in the land of Israel, similar to the census his father David had taken. There were 153,600 resident foreigners. 
142Ch 2:18 He assigned 70,000 of them to transport materials and 80,000 to cut stones in the mountains, and appointed 3,600 supervisors to make sure the work was done. 
142Ch 3:1 King David, Solomon's father, had already prepared a place for the Temple. It was in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared to David, at the place which Araunah the Jebusite had used as a threshing place. King Solomon began the construction 
142Ch 3:2 in the second month of the fourth year that he was king. 
142Ch 3:3 The Temple which King Solomon built was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. 
142Ch 3:4 The entrance room was the full width of the Temple, 30 feet, and was 180 feet high. The inside of the room was overlaid with pure gold. 
142Ch 3:5 The main room was paneled with cedar and overlaid with fine gold, in which were worked designs of palm trees and chain patterns. 
142Ch 3:6 The king decorated the Temple with beautiful precious stones and with gold imported from the land of Parvaim. 
142Ch 3:7 He used the gold to overlay the Temple walls, the rafters, the entryways, and the doors. On the walls the workers carved designs of winged creatures. 
142Ch 3:8 The inner room, called the Most Holy Place, was 30 feet long and 30 feet wide, which was the full width of the Temple. Twenty-five tons of gold were used to cover the walls of the Most Holy Place; 
142Ch 3:9 twenty ounces of gold were used for making nails, and the walls of the upper rooms were also covered with gold. 
142Ch 3:10 The king also had his workers make two winged creatures out of metal, cover them with gold, and place them in the Most Holy Place, 
142Ch 3:11 where they stood side by side facing the entrance.
142Ch 3:12 Each had two wings, each wing 7 1/2 feet long, 
142Ch 3:13 which were spread out so that they touched each other in the center of the room and reached to the wall on either side of the room, stretching across the full width of 30 feet.
142Ch 3:14 A curtain for the Most Holy Place was made of linen and of other material, which was dyed blue, purple, and red, with designs of the winged creatures worked into it. 
142Ch 3:15 The king had two columns made, each one 52 feet tall, and placed them in front of the Temple. Each one had a capital 7 1/2 feet tall. 
142Ch 3:16 The tops of the columns were decorated with a design of interwoven chains and one hundred bronze pomegranates. 
142Ch 3:17 The columns were set at the sides of the Temple entrance�� the one on the south side was named Jachin and the one on the north side was named Boaz. 
142Ch 4:1 King Solomon had a bronze altar made, which was 30 feet square and 15 feet high. 
142Ch 4:2 He also made a round tank of bronze, 7 1/2 feet deep, 15 feet in diameter, and 45 feet in circumference. 
142Ch 4:3 All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations, one above the other. The decorations were in the shape of bulls, which had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank. 
142Ch 4:4 The tank rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward, three facing in each direction. 
142Ch 4:5 The sides of the tank were 3 inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about 15,000 gallons. 
142Ch 4:6 They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing. 
142Ch 4:7 They made ten gold lampstands according to the usual pattern, and ten tables, and placed them in the main room of the Temple, 
142Ch 4:8 five lampstands and five tables on each side. They also made a hundred gold bowls.
142Ch 4:9 They made an inner courtyard for the priests, and also an outer courtyard. The doors in the gates between the courtyards were covered with bronze. 
142Ch 4:10 The tank was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple. 
142Ch 4:11 Huram also made pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed all the objects that he had promised King Solomon he would make for the Temple�� 
142Ch 4:12 The two columns The two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the columns The design of interwoven chains on each capital 
142Ch 4:13 The 400 bronze pomegranates arranged in two rows around the design of each capital 
142Ch 4:14 The ten carts The ten basins The tank The twelve bulls supporting the tank.
142Ch 4:15 The pots, shovels, and forks Huram the master metalworker made all these objects out of polished bronze,
142Ch 4:16 as King Solomon had commanded, for use in the Temple of the LORD. 
142Ch 4:17 The king had them all made in the foundry between Sukkoth and Zeredah in the Jordan Valley. 
142Ch 4:18 So many objects were made that no one determined the total weight of the bronze used. 
142Ch 4:19 King Solomon also had gold furnishings made for the Temple�� the altar and the tables for the bread offered to God; 
142Ch 4:20 the lampstands and the lamps of fine gold that were to burn in front of the Most Holy Place, according to plan; 
142Ch 4:21 the flower decorations, the lamps, and the tongs; 
142Ch 4:22 the lamp snuffers, the bowls, the dishes for incense, and the pans used for carrying live coals. All these objects were made of pure gold. The outer doors of the Temple and the doors to the Most Holy Place were overlaid with gold. 
142Ch 5:1 When King Solomon finished all the work on the Temple, he placed in the Temple storerooms all the things that his father David had dedicated to the LORD - the silver, gold, and other articles. 
142Ch 5:2 Then King Solomon summoned all the leaders of the tribes and clans of Israel to assemble in Jerusalem, in order to take the LORD's Covenant Box from Zion, David's City, to the Temple. 
142Ch 5:3 They all assembled at the time of the Festival of Shelters. 
142Ch 5:4 When all the leaders had gathered, then the Levites lifted the Covenant Box 
142Ch 5:5 and carried it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites also moved the Tent of the LORD's presence and all its equipment to the Temple. 
142Ch 5:6 King Solomon and all the people of Israel assembled in front of the Covenant Box and sacrificed a large number of sheep and cattle - too many to count. 
142Ch 5:7 Then the priests carried the Covenant Box of the LORD into the Temple and put it in the Most Holy Place, beneath the winged creatures. 
142Ch 5:8 Their outstretched wings covered the Box and the poles it was carried by. 
142Ch 5:9 The ends of the poles could be seen by anyone standing directly in front of the Most Holy Place, but from nowhere else. (The poles are still there today.) 
142Ch 5:10 There was nothing inside the Covenant Box except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there at Mount Sinai, when the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel as they were coming from Egypt. 
142Ch 5:11 All the priests present, regardless of the group to which they belonged, had consecrated themselves. And all the Levite musicians - Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, and the members of their clans - were wearing linen clothing. 
142Ch 5:12 The Levites stood near the east side of the altar with cymbals and harps, and with them were 120 priests playing trumpets. 
142Ch 5:13 The singers were accompanied in perfect harmony by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, as they praised the LORD singing�� "Praise the LORD, because he is good, And his love is eternal." 
142Ch 5:14 As the priests were leaving the Temple, it was suddenly filled with a cloud shining with the dazzling light of the LORD's presence, and they could not continue the service of worship. 
142Ch 6:1 Then King Solomon prayed, "LORD, you have chosen to live in clouds and darkness. 
142Ch 6:2 Now I have built a majestic temple for you, a place for you to live in forever." 
142Ch 6:3 All the people of Israel were standing there. The king turned to face them and asked God's blessing on them. 
142Ch 6:4 He said, "Praise the LORD God of Israel! He has kept the promise he made to my father David when he said to him, 
142Ch 6:5 'From the time I brought my people out of Egypt until now, I did not choose any city in the land of Israel as the place to build a temple where I would be worshiped, and I did not choose anyone to lead my people Israel. 
142Ch 6:6 But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place where I will be worshiped, and you, David, to rule my people.' " 
142Ch 6:7 And Solomon continued, "My father David planned to build a temple for the worship of the LORD God of Israel, 
142Ch 6:8 but the LORD said to him, 'You were right in wanting to build a temple for me, 
142Ch 6:9 but you will never build it. It is your son, your own son, who will build my temple.' 
142Ch 6:10 "Now the LORD has kept his promise�� I have succeeded my father as king of Israel, and I have built a temple for the worship of the LORD God of Israel. 
142Ch 6:11 I have placed in the Temple the Covenant Box, which contains the stone tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with the people of Israel." 
142Ch 6:12 Then in the presence of the people Solomon went and stood in front of the altar and raised his arms in prayer. 
142Ch 6:13 (Solomon had made a bronze platform and put it in the middle of the courtyard. It was eight feet square and five feet high. He mounted this platform, knelt down where everyone could see him, and raised his hands toward heaven.) 
142Ch 6:14 He prayed, " LORD God of Israel, in all heaven and earth there is no god like you. You keep your covenant with your people and show them your love when they live in wholehearted obedience to you. 
142Ch 6:15 You have kept the promise you made to my father David; today every word has been fulfilled. 
142Ch 6:16 Now, LORD God of Israel, keep the other promise you made to my father when you told him that there would always be one of his descendants ruling as king of Israel, provided that they carefully obeyed your Law just as he did. 
142Ch 6:17 So now, LORD God of Israel, let everything come true that you promised to your servant David. 
142Ch 6:18 "But can you, O God, really live on earth among men and women? Not even all of heaven is large enough to hold you, so how can this Temple that I have built be large enough? 
142Ch 6:19 LORD my God, I am your servant. Listen to my prayer and grant the requests I make to you. 
142Ch 6:20 Watch over this Temple day and night. You have promised that this is where you will be worshiped, so hear me when I face this Temple and pray. 
142Ch 6:21 Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when they face this place and pray. In your home in heaven hear us and forgive us. 
142Ch 6:22 "When people are accused of wronging others and are brought to your altar in this Temple to take an oath that they are innocent, 
142Ch 6:23 O LORD, listen in heaven and judge your servants. Punish the guilty ones as they deserve and acquit the innocent. 
142Ch 6:24 "When your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you and then when they turn to you and come to this Temple, humbly praying to you for forgiveness, 
142Ch 6:25 listen to them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people and bring them back to the land which you gave to them and to their ancestors. 
142Ch 6:26 "When you hold back the rain because your people have sinned against you and then when they repent and face this Temple, humbly praying to you, 
142Ch 6:27 O LORD, listen to them in heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, the people of Israel, and teach them to do what is right. Then, O LORD, send rain on this land of yours, which you gave to your people as a permanent possession. 
142Ch 6:28 "When there is famine in the land or an epidemic or the crops are destroyed by scorching winds or swarms of locusts, or when your people are attacked by their enemies, or when there is disease or sickness among them, 
142Ch 6:29 listen to their prayers. If any of your people Israel, out of heartfelt sorrow, stretch out their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
142Ch 6:30 hear their prayer. Listen to them in your home in heaven and forgive them. You alone know the thoughts of the human heart. Deal with each of us as we deserve, 
142Ch 6:31 so that your people may honor you and obey you all the time they live in the land which you gave to our ancestors. 
142Ch 6:32 "When foreigners who live in a distant land hear how great and powerful you are and how you are always ready to act, and then they come to pray at this Temple, 
142Ch 6:33 listen to their prayers. In heaven, where you live, hear them and do what they ask you to do, so that all the peoples of the world may know you and obey you, as your people Israel do. Then they will know that this Temple I have built is where you are to be worshiped. 
142Ch 6:34 "When you command your people to go into battle against their enemies and they pray to you, wherever they are, facing this city which you have chosen and this Temple which I have built for you, 
142Ch 6:35 listen to their prayers. Hear them in heaven and give them victory. 
142Ch 6:36 "When your people sin against you - and there is no one who does not sin - and in your anger you let their enemies defeat them and take them as prisoners to some other land, even if that land is far away, 
142Ch 6:37 listen to your people's prayers. If there in that land they repent and pray to you, confessing how sinful and wicked they have been, hear their prayers, O LORD. 
142Ch 6:38 If in that land they truly and sincerely repent and pray to you as they face toward this land which you gave to our ancestors, this city which you have chosen, and this Temple which I have built for you, 
142Ch 6:39 then listen to their prayers. In your home in heaven hear them and be merciful to them and forgive all the sins of your people. 
142Ch 6:40 "Now, O my God, look on us and listen to the prayers offered in this place. 
142Ch 6:41 Rise up now, LORD God, and with the Covenant Box, the symbol of your power, enter the Temple and stay here forever. Bless your priests in all they do, and may all your people be happy because of your goodness to them. 
142Ch 6:42 LORD God, do not reject the king you have chosen. Remember the love you had for your servant David." 
142Ch 7:1 When King Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and burned up the sacrifices that had been offered, and the dazzling light of the LORD's presence filled the Temple. 
142Ch 7:2 Because the Temple was full of the dazzling light, the priests could not enter it. 
142Ch 7:3 When the people of Israel saw the fire fall from heaven and the light fill the Temple, they fell face downward on the pavement, worshiping God and praising him for his goodness and his eternal love. 
142Ch 7:4 Then Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the LORD. 
142Ch 7:5 He sacrificed 22,000 head of cattle and 120,000 sheep as fellowship offerings. And so he and all the people dedicated the Temple. 
142Ch 7:6 The priests stood in the places that were assigned to them, and facing them stood the Levites, praising the LORD with the musical instruments that King David had provided and singing the hymn, "His Love Is Eternal!" as they had been commissioned by David. The priests blew trumpets while all the people stood. 
142Ch 7:7 Solomon consecrated the central part of the courtyard, the area in front of the Temple, and then offered there the sacrifices burned whole, the grain offerings, and the fat from the fellowship offerings. He did this because the bronze altar which he had made was too small for all these offerings. 
142Ch 7:8 Solomon and all the people of Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters for seven days. There was a huge crowd of people from as far away as Hamath Pass in the north and the Egyptian border in the south. 
142Ch 7:9 They had spent seven days for the dedication of the altar and then seven more days for the festival. On the last day they had a closing celebration, 
142Ch 7:10 and on the following day, the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people home. They were happy about all the blessings that the LORD had given to his people Israel, to David, and to Solomon. 
142Ch 7:11 After King Solomon had finished the Temple and the palace, successfully completing all his plans for them, 
142Ch 7:12 the LORD appeared to him at night. He said to him, "I have heard your prayer, and I accept this Temple as the place where sacrifices are to be offered to me. 
142Ch 7:13 Whenever I hold back the rain or send locusts to eat up the crops or send an epidemic on my people, 
142Ch 7:14 if they pray to me and repent and turn away from the evil they have been doing, then I will hear them in heaven, forgive their sins, and make their land prosperous again. 
142Ch 7:15 I will watch over this Temple and be ready to hear all the prayers that are offered here, 
142Ch 7:16 because I have chosen it and consecrated it as the place where I will be worshiped forever. I will watch over it and protect it for all time. 
142Ch 7:17 If you serve me faithfully as your father David did, obeying my laws and doing everything I have commanded you, 
142Ch 7:18 I will keep the promise I made to your father David when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by his descendants. 
142Ch 7:19 But if you and your people ever disobey the laws and commands I have given you and worship other gods, 
142Ch 7:20 then I will remove you from the land that I gave you, and I will abandon this Temple that I have consecrated as the place where I am to be worshiped. People everywhere will ridicule it and treat it with contempt. 
142Ch 7:21 "The Temple is now greatly honored, but then everyone who passes by it will be amazed and will ask, 'Why did the LORD do this to this land and this Temple?' 
142Ch 7:22 People will answer, 'It is because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt. They gave their allegiance to other gods and worshiped them. That is why the LORD has brought this disaster on them.' " 
142Ch 8:1 It took Solomon twenty years to build the Temple and his palace. 
142Ch 8:2 He also rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given him, and sent Israelites to settle in them. 
142Ch 8:3 He captured the territory of Hamath and Zobah 
142Ch 8:4 and fortified the city of Palmyra in the desert. He rebuilt all the cities in Hamath that were centers for storing supplies. 
142Ch 8:5 Solomon also rebuilt the following cities�� Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon (fortified cities with gates that could be barred), 
142Ch 8:6 the city of Baalath, all the cities where he stored supplies, and the cities where his horses and chariots were stationed. He carried out all his plans for building in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout the territory that he ruled over. 
142Ch 8:7 Solomon employed at forced labor all the descendants of the people of Canaan whom the Israelites had not killed when they took possession of the land. 
142Ch 8:8 These included Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, whose descendants continue to be slaves down to the present time. 
142Ch 8:9 Israelites were not used at forced labor, but served as soldiers, officers, chariot commanders, and cavalry troops. 
142Ch 8:10 There were 250 officials in charge of the forced labor working on the various building projects. 
142Ch 8:11 Solomon moved his wife, the daughter of the king of Egypt, from David's City to a house he built for her. He said, "She must not live in the palace of King David of Israel, because any place where the Covenant Box has been is holy." 
142Ch 8:12 Solomon offered sacrifices to the LORD on the altar which he had built in front of the Temple. 
142Ch 8:13 He offered burnt offerings according to the requirements of the Law of Moses for each holy day�� Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and the three annual festivals - the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters. 
142Ch 8:14 Following the rules laid down by his father David, he organized the daily work of the priests and of the Levites who assisted the priests in singing hymns and in doing their work. He also organized the Temple guards in sections for performing their daily duties at each gate, in accordance with the commands of David, the man of God. 
142Ch 8:15 The instructions which David had given the priests and the Levites concerning the storehouses and other matters were carried out in detail. 
142Ch 8:16 By this time all of Solomon's projects had been completed. From the laying of the foundation of the LORD's Temple to its completion, all the work had been successful. 
142Ch 8:17 Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and Elath, ports on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, in the land of Edom. 
142Ch 8:18 King Hiram sent him ships under the command of his own officers and with experienced sailors. They sailed with Solomon's officers to the land of Ophir and brought back to Solomon about sixteen tons of gold. 
142Ch 9:1 The queen of Sheba heard of King Solomon's fame, and she traveled to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She brought with her a large group of attendants, as well as camels loaded with spices, jewels, and a large amount of gold. When she and Solomon met, she asked him all the questions that she could think of. 
142Ch 9:2 He answered them all; there was nothing too difficult for him to explain. 
142Ch 9:3 The queen of Sheba heard Solomon's wisdom and saw the palace he had built. 
142Ch 9:4 She saw the food that was served at his table, the living quarters for his officials, the organization of his palace staff and the uniforms they wore, the clothing of the servants who waited on him at feasts, and the sacrifices he offered in the Temple. It left her breathless and amazed. 
142Ch 9:5 She said to the king, "What I heard in my own country about you and your wisdom is true! 
142Ch 9:6 I did not believe what they told me until I came and saw for myself. I had not heard of even half your wisdom. You are even wiser than people say. 
142Ch 9:7 How fortunate are those who serve you, who are always in your presence and are privileged to hear your wise sayings! 
142Ch 9:8 Praise the LORD your God! He has shown how pleased he is with you by making you king, to rule in his name. Because he loves his people Israel and wants to preserve them forever, he has made you their king so that you can maintain law and justice." 
142Ch 9:9 She presented to King Solomon the gifts she had brought�� almost five tons of gold and a very large amount of spices and jewels. There have never been any other spices as fine as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
142Ch 9:10 (The sailors of King Hiram and of King Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought juniper wood and jewels. 
142Ch 9:11 Solomon used the wood to make stairs for the Temple and for his palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like that had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.) 
142Ch 9:12 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she asked for. This was in addition to what he gave her in exchange for the gifts she brought to him. Then she and her attendants returned to the land of Sheba. 
142Ch 9:13 Every year King Solomon received over twenty-five tons of gold, 
142Ch 9:14 in addition to the taxes paid by the traders and merchants. The kings of Arabia and the governors of the Israelite districts also brought him silver and gold. 
142Ch 9:15 Solomon made two hundred large shields, each of which was covered with about fifteen pounds of beaten gold, 
142Ch 9:16 and three hundred smaller shields, each covered with about eight pounds of beaten gold. He had them all placed in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon. 
142Ch 9:17 The king also had a large throne made. Part of it was covered with ivory and the rest of it was covered with pure gold. 
142Ch 9:18 Six steps led up to the throne, and there was a footstool attached to it, covered with gold. There were arms on each side of the throne, and the figure of a lion stood at each side. 
142Ch 9:19 Twelve figures of lions were on the steps, one at either end of each step. No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom. 
142Ch 9:20 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's day. 
142Ch 9:21 He had a fleet of ocean-going ships sailing with King Hiram's fleet. Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys. 
142Ch 9:22 King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king in the world. 
142Ch 9:23 They all consulted him, to hear the wisdom that God had given him. 
142Ch 9:24 Each of them brought Solomon gifts - articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year. 
142Ch 9:25 King Solomon also had four thousand stalls for his chariots and horses, and had twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem and the rest he stationed in various other cities. 
142Ch 9:26 He was supreme ruler of all the kings in the territory from the Euphrates River to Philistia and the Egyptian border. 
142Ch 9:27 During his reign silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah. 
142Ch 9:28 Solomon imported horses from Musri and from every other country. 
142Ch 9:29 The rest of the history of Solomon from beginning to end is recorded in The History of Nathan the Prophet,in The Prophecy of Ahijah of Shiloh,and in The Visions of Iddo the Prophet,which also deal with the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel.
142Ch 9:30 Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
142Ch 9:31 He died and was buried in David's City, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the people of northern Israel had gathered to make him king. 
142Ch 10:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had gone to Egypt to escape from King Solomon, heard this news, he returned home. 
142Ch 10:3 The people of the northern tribes sent for him, and they all went together to Rehoboam and said to him, 
142Ch 10:4 "Your father placed heavy burdens on us. If you make these burdens lighter and make life easier for us, we will be your loyal subjects." 
142Ch 10:5 Rehoboam replied, "Give me three days to consider the matter. Then come back." So the people left. 
142Ch 10:6 King Rehoboam consulted the older men who had served as his father Solomon's advisers. "What answer do you advise me to give these people?" he asked. 
142Ch 10:7 They replied, "If you are kind to these people and try to please them by giving a considerate answer, they will always serve you loyally." 
142Ch 10:8 But he ignored the advice of the older men and went instead to the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his advisers. 
142Ch 10:9 "What do you advise me to do?" he asked. "What shall I say to the people who are asking me to make their burdens lighter?" 
142Ch 10:10 They replied, "This is what you should tell them�� 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.' 
142Ch 10:11 Tell them, 'My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!' " 
142Ch 10:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to King Rehoboam, as he had instructed them. 
142Ch 10:13 The king ignored the advice of the older men and spoke harshly to the people, 
142Ch 10:14 as the younger men had advised. He said, "My father placed heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. He beat you with whips; I'll flog you with bullwhips!" 
142Ch 10:15 It was the will of the LORD God to bring about what he had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh. This is why the king did not pay any attention to the people. 
142Ch 10:16 When the people saw that the king would not listen to them, they shouted, "Down with David and his family! What have they ever done for us? People of Israel, let's go home! Let Rehoboam look out for himself !" So the people of Israel rebelled, 
142Ch 10:17 leaving Rehoboam as king only of the people who lived in the territory of Judah. 
142Ch 10:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoniram, who was in charge of the forced labor, to go to the Israelites, but they stoned him to death. At this, Rehoboam hurriedly got in his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 10:19 Ever since that time the people of the northern kingdom of Israel have been in rebellion against the dynasty of David. 
142Ch 11:1 When King Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he called together 180,000 of the best soldiers from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. He intended to go to war and restore his control over the northern tribes of Israel. 
142Ch 11:2 But the LORD told the prophet Shemaiah 
142Ch 11:3 to give this message to King Rehoboam and to all the people of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin��
142Ch 11:4 "Do not attack your own relatives. Go home, all of you. What has happened is my will." They obeyed the LORD's command and did not go to fight Jeroboam. 
142Ch 11:5 Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and had fortifications built for the following cities of Judah and Benjamin��
142Ch 11:6 Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
142Ch 11:7 Bethzur, Soco, Adullam, 
142Ch 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
142Ch 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
142Ch 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. 
142Ch 11:11 He had them strongly fortified and appointed a commander for each of them, and in each one he placed supplies of food, olive oil, and wine, 
142Ch 11:12 and also shields and spears. In this way he kept Judah and Benjamin under his control. 
142Ch 11:13 From all the territory of Israel priests and Levites came south to Judah. 
142Ch 11:14 The Levites abandoned their pastures and other land and moved to Judah and Jerusalem, because King Jeroboam of Israel and his successors would not let them serve as priests of the LORD. 
142Ch 11:15 Jeroboam appointed priests of his own to serve at the pagan places of worship and to worship demons and the idols he made in the form of bull-calves. 
142Ch 11:16 From all the tribes of Israel people who sincerely wanted to worship the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem, so that they could offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 11:17 This strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon and lived as they had under the rule of King David and King Solomon. 
142Ch 11:18 Rehoboam married Mahalath, whose father was Jerimoth son of David and whose mother was Abihail, the daughter of Eliab and granddaughter of Jesse. 
142Ch 11:19 They had three sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
142Ch 11:20 Later he married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and they had four sons�� Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
142Ch 11:21 In all, Rehoboam had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Of all his wives and concubines he loved Maacah best, 
142Ch 11:22 and he favored her son Abijah over all his other children, choosing him as the one to succeed him as king. 
142Ch 11:23 Rehoboam wisely assigned responsibilities to his sons and stationed them throughout Judah and Benjamin in the fortified cities. He provided generously for them and also secured many wives for them. 
142Ch 12:1 As soon as Rehoboam had established his authority as king, he and all his people abandoned the Law of the LORD. 
142Ch 12:2 In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign their disloyalty to the LORD was punished. King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem 
142Ch 12:3 with an army of twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand cavalry, and more soldiers than could be counted, including Libyan, Sukkite, and Ethiopian troops. 
142Ch 12:4 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and advanced as far as Jerusalem. 
142Ch 12:5 Shemaiah the prophet went to King Rehoboam and the Judean leaders who had gathered in Jerusalem to escape Shishak. He said to them, "This is the LORD's message to you�� 'You have abandoned me, so now I have abandoned you to Shishak.' " 
142Ch 12:6 The king and the leaders admitted that they had sinned, and they said, "What the LORD is doing is just." 
142Ch 12:7 When the LORD saw this, he spoke again to Shemaiah and said to him, "Because they admit their sin, I will not destroy them. But when Shishak attacks, they will barely survive. Jerusalem will not feel the full force of my anger, 
142Ch 12:8 but Shishak will conquer them, and they will learn the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers." 
142Ch 12:9 King Shishak came to Jerusalem and took the treasures from the Temple and from the palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that King Solomon had made. 
142Ch 12:10 To replace them, Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the officers responsible for guarding the palace gates. 
142Ch 12:11 Every time the king went to the Temple, the guards carried the shields and then returned them to the guardroom. 
142Ch 12:12 Because he submitted to the LORD, the LORD's anger did not completely destroy him, and things went well for Judah. 
142Ch 12:13 Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem and increased his power as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he ruled for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the territory of Israel as the place where he was to be worshiped. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah, from the land of Ammon. 
142Ch 12:14 He did what was evil, because he did not try to find the LORD's will. 
142Ch 12:15 Rehoboam's acts from beginning to end and his family records are found in The History of Shemaiah the Prophet and The History of Iddo the Prophet.Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly at war with each other.
142Ch 12:16 Rehoboam died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Abijah succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 13:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam of Israel, Abijah became king of Judah, 
142Ch 13:2 and he ruled three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Micaiah daughter of Uriel, from the city of Gibeah. War broke out between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
142Ch 13:3 Abijah raised an army of 400,000 soldiers, and Jeroboam opposed him with an army of 800,000. 
142Ch 13:4 The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim. King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites�� "Listen to me!" he said. 
142Ch 13:5 "Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, made an unbreakable covenant with David, giving him and his descendants kingship over Israel forever? 
142Ch 13:6 Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against Solomon, his king. 
142Ch 13:7 Later he gathered together a group of worthless scoundrels, and they forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon, who was too young and inexperienced to resist them. 
142Ch 13:8 Now you propose to fight against the royal authority that the LORD gave to David's descendants. You have a huge army and have with you the gold bull-calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods. 
142Ch 13:9 You drove out the LORD's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and you drove out the Levites. In their place you appointed priests in the same way that other nations do. Anybody who comes along with a bull or seven sheep can get himself consecrated as a priest of those so-called gods of yours. 
142Ch 13:10 "But we still serve the LORD our God and have not abandoned him. Priests descended from Aaron perform their duties, and Levites assist them. 
142Ch 13:11 Every morning and every evening they offer him incense and animal sacrifices burned whole. They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean, and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lampstand. We do what the LORD has commanded, but you have abandoned him. 
142Ch 13:12 God himself is our leader and his priests are here with trumpets, ready to blow them and call us to battle against you. People of Israel, don't fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors! You can't win!" 
142Ch 13:13 Meanwhile Jeroboam had sent some of his troops to ambush the Judean army from the rear, while the rest faced them from the front. 
142Ch 13:14 The Judeans looked around and saw that they were surrounded. They cried to the LORD for help, and the priests blew the trumpets. 
142Ch 13:15 The Judeans gave a loud shout, and led by Abijah, they attacked; God defeated Jeroboam and the Israelite army. 
142Ch 13:16 The Israelites fled from the Judeans, and God let the Judeans overpower them. 
142Ch 13:17 Abijah and his army dealt the Israelites a crushing defeat - half a million of Israel's best soldiers were killed. 
142Ch 13:18 And so the people of Judah were victorious over Israel, because they relied on the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 13:19 Abijah pursued Jeroboam's army and occupied some of his cities�� Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the villages near each of these cities. 
142Ch 13:20 Jeroboam never regained his power during Abijah's reign. Finally the LORD struck him down, and he died. 
142Ch 13:21 Abijah, however, grew more powerful. He had fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
142Ch 13:22 The rest of the history of Abijah, what he said and what he did, is written in The History of Iddo the Prophet.
142Ch 14:1 King Abijah died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Asa succeeded him as king, and under Asa the land enjoyed peace for ten years. 
142Ch 14:2 Asa pleased the LORD, his God, by doing what was right and good. 
142Ch 14:3 He removed the foreign altars and the pagan places of worship, broke down the sacred stone columns, and cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah. 
142Ch 14:4 He commanded the people of Judah to do the will of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his teachings and commands. 
142Ch 14:5 Because he abolished the pagan places of worship and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, the kingdom was at peace under his rule. 
142Ch 14:6 He built fortifications for the cities of Judah during this time, and for several years there was no war, because the LORD gave him peace. 
142Ch 14:7 He told the people of Judah, "Let us fortify the cities by building walls and towers, and gates that can be shut and barred. We have control of the land because we have done the will of the LORD our God. He has protected us and given us security on every side." And so they built and prospered. 
142Ch 14:8 King Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, armed with shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin, armed with shields and bows. All of them were brave, well-trained men. 
142Ch 14:9 An Ethiopian named Zerah invaded Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots and advanced as far as Mareshah. 
142Ch 14:10 Asa went out to fight him, and both sides took up their positions at Zephathah Valley near Mareshah. 
142Ch 14:11 Asa prayed to the LORD his God, "O LORD, you can help a weak army as easily as a powerful one. Help us now, O LORD our God, because we are relying on you, and in your name we have come out to fight against this huge army. LORD, you are our God; no one can hope to defeat you." 
142Ch 14:12 The LORD defeated the Ethiopian army when Asa and the Judean army attacked them. They fled, 
142Ch 14:13 and Asa and his troops pursued them as far as Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians were killed that the army was unable to rally and fight. They were overpowered by the LORD and his army, and the army took large amounts of loot. 
142Ch 14:14 Then they were able to destroy the cities in the area around Gerar, because the people there were terrified of the LORD. The army plundered all those cities and captured large amounts of loot. 
142Ch 14:15 They also attacked the camps of some shepherds, capturing large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 15:1 The spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded, 
142Ch 15:2 and he went to meet King Asa. He called out, "Listen to me, King Asa, and all you people of Judah and Benjamin! The LORD is with you as long as you are with him. If you look for him, he will let you find him, but if you turn away, he will abandon you. 
142Ch 15:3 For a long time Israel lived without the true God, without priests to teach them, and without a law. 
142Ch 15:4 But when trouble came, they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel. They searched for him and found him. 
142Ch 15:5 In those days no one could come and go in safety, because there was trouble and disorder in every land. 
142Ch 15:6 One nation oppressed another nation, and one city oppressed another city, because God was bringing trouble and distress on them. 
142Ch 15:7 But you must be strong and not be discouraged. The work that you do will be rewarded." 
142Ch 15:8 When Asa heard the prophecy that Azariah son of Oded had spoken, he was encouraged. He did away with all the idols in the land of Judah and Benjamin and all the idols in the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He also repaired the altar of the LORD that stood in the Temple courtyard. 
142Ch 15:9 Many people had come over to Asa's side from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, and were living in his kingdom, because they had seen that the LORD was with him. Asa summoned all of them and the people of Judah and Benjamin. 
142Ch 15:10 They assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year that Asa was king. 
142Ch 15:11 On that day they offered sacrifices to the LORD from the loot they had brought back�� seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep. 
142Ch 15:12 They made a covenant in which they agreed to worship the LORD, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul. 
142Ch 15:13 Anyone, young or old, male or female, who did not worship him was to be put to death. 
142Ch 15:14 In a loud voice they took an oath in the LORD's name that they would keep the covenant, and then they shouted and blew trumpets. 
142Ch 15:15 All the people of Judah were happy because they had made this covenant with all their heart. They took delight in worshiping the LORD, and he accepted them and gave them peace on every side. 
142Ch 15:16 King Asa removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol of the fertility goddess Asherah. Asa cut down the idol, chopped it up, and burned the pieces in Kidron Valley. 
142Ch 15:17 Even though Asa did not destroy all the pagan places of worship in the land, he remained faithful to the LORD all his life. 
142Ch 15:18 He placed in the Temple all the objects his father Abijah had dedicated to God, as well as the gold and silver objects that he himself dedicated. 
142Ch 15:19 There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of his reign. 
142Ch 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and started to fortify Ramah in order to cut off all traffic in and out of Judah. 
142Ch 16:2 So Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple and the palace and sent it to Damascus, to King Benhadad of Syria, with this message��
142Ch 16:3 "Let us be allies, as our fathers were. This silver and gold is a present for you. Now break your alliance with King Baasha of Israel so that he will have to pull his troops out of my territory." 
142Ch 16:4 Benhadad agreed to Asa's proposal and sent his commanding officers and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah, and all the cities of Naphtali where supplies were stored. 
142Ch 16:5 When King Baasha heard what was happening, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work. 
142Ch 16:6 Then King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah, and they used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah. 
142Ch 16:7 At that time the prophet Hanani went to King Asa and said, "Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Israel has escaped from you. 
142Ch 16:8 Didn't the Ethiopians and the Libyans have large armies with many chariots and cavalry troops? But because you relied on the LORD, he gave you victory over them. 
142Ch 16:9 The LORD keeps close watch over the whole world, to give strength to those whose hearts are loyal to him. You have acted foolishly, and so from now on you will always be at war." 
142Ch 16:10 This made Asa so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains. It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly. 
142Ch 16:11 All the events of Asa's reign from beginning to end are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king, he was crippled by a severe foot disease; but even then he did not turn to the LORD for help, but to doctors. 
142Ch 16:13 Two years later he died 
142Ch 16:14 and was buried in the rock tomb which he had carved out for himself in David's City. They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial, and they built a huge bonfire to mourn his death. 
142Ch 17:1 Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa as king and strengthened his position against Israel. 
142Ch 17:2 He stationed troops in the fortified cities of Judah, in the Judean countryside, and in the cities which Asa had captured in the territory of Ephraim. 
142Ch 17:3 The LORD blessed Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father's early life and did not worship Baal. 
142Ch 17:4 He served his father's God, obeyed God's commands, and did not act the way the kings of Israel did. 
142Ch 17:5 The LORD gave Jehoshaphat firm control over the kingdom of Judah, and all the people brought him gifts, so that he became wealthy and highly honored. 
142Ch 17:6 He took pride in serving the LORD and destroyed all the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah in Judah. 
142Ch 17:7 In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah�� Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah. 
142Ch 17:8 They were accompanied by nine Levites and two priests. The Levites were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and the priests were Elishama and Jehoram. 
142Ch 17:9 They took the book of the Law of the LORD and went through all the towns of Judah, teaching it to the people. 
142Ch 17:10 The LORD made all the surrounding kingdoms afraid to go to war against King Jehoshaphat. 
142Ch 17:11 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat a large amount of silver and other gifts, and some Arabs brought him 7,700 sheep and 7,700 goats. 
142Ch 17:12 So Jehoshaphat continued to grow more and more powerful. Throughout Judah he built fortifications and cities, 
142Ch 17:13 where supplies were stored in huge amounts. In Jerusalem he stationed outstanding officers, 
142Ch 17:14 according to their clans. Adnah was the commander of the troops from the clans of Judah, and he had 300,000 soldiers under him. 
142Ch 17:15 Second in rank was Jehohanan, with 280,000 soldiers, 
142Ch 17:16 and third was Amasiah son of Zichri, with 200,000. (Amasiah had volunteered to serve the LORD.) 
142Ch 17:17 The commander of the troops from the clans of Benjamin was Eliada, an outstanding soldier, in command of 200,000 men armed with shields and bows. 
142Ch 17:18 His second in command was Jehozabad with 180,000 men, well-equipped for battle. 
142Ch 17:19 These soldiers served the king in Jerusalem, and in addition he stationed others in the other fortified cities of Judah. 
142Ch 18:1 When King Jehoshaphat of Judah became rich and famous, he arranged a marriage between a member of his family and the family of King Ahab of Israel. 
142Ch 18:2 A number of years later Jehoshaphat went to the city of Samaria to visit Ahab. To honor Jehoshaphat and those with him, Ahab had a large number of sheep and cattle slaughtered for a feast. He tried to persuade Jehoshaphat to join him in attacking the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
142Ch 18:3 He asked, "Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am ready when you are, and so is my army. We will join you." 
142Ch 18:4 Then he added, "But first let's consult the LORD." 
142Ch 18:5 So Ahab called in the prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked them, "Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?" "Attack it," they answered. "God will give you victory." 
142Ch 18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there another prophet through whom we can consult the LORD?" 
142Ch 18:7 Ahab answered, "There is one more, Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad." "You shouldn't say that!" Jehoshaphat replied. 
142Ch 18:8 So King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once. 
142Ch 18:9 The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
142Ch 18:10 One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab, "This is what the LORD says, 'With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.' " 
142Ch 18:11 All the other prophets said the same thing. "March against Ramoth and you will win," they said. "The LORD will give you victory." 
142Ch 18:12 Meanwhile, the official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, "All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king, and you had better do the same." 
142Ch 18:13 But Micaiah answered, "By the living LORD I will say what my God tells me to!" 
142Ch 18:14 When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?" "Attack!" Micaiah answered. "Of course you'll win. The LORD will give you victory." 
142Ch 18:15 But Ahab replied, "When you speak to me in the name of the LORD, tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?" 
142Ch 18:16 Micaiah answered, "I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'These men have no leader; let them go home in peace.' " 
142Ch 18:17 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me; it's always something bad!" 
142Ch 18:18 Micaiah went on�� "Now listen to what the LORD says! I saw the LORD sitting on his throne in heaven, with all his angels standing beside him. 
142Ch 18:19 The LORD asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and get killed at Ramoth?' Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else, 
142Ch 18:20 until a spirit stepped forward, approached the LORD, and said, 'I will deceive him.' 'How?' the LORD asked. 
142Ch 18:21 The spirit replied, 'I will go and make all of Ahab's prophets tell lies.' The LORD said, 'Go and deceive him. You will succeed.' " 
142Ch 18:22 And Micaiah concluded�� "This is what has happened. The LORD has made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he himself has decreed that you will meet with disaster!" 
142Ch 18:23 Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah, slapped his face, and asked, "Since when did the LORD's spirit leave me and speak to you?" 
142Ch 18:24 "You will find out when you go into some back room to hide," Micaiah replied. 
142Ch 18:25 Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers, "Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash. 
142Ch 18:26 Tell them to throw him in prison and to put him on bread and water until I return safely." 
142Ch 18:27 "If you return safely," Micaiah exclaimed, "then the LORD has not spoken through me!" And he added, "Listen, everyone, to what I have said!" 
142Ch 18:28 Then King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to attack the city of Ramoth in Gilead. 
142Ch 18:29 Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself, but you wear your royal garments." So the king of Israel went into battle in disguise. 
142Ch 18:30 The king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders to attack no one else except the king of Israel. 
142Ch 18:31 So when they saw King Jehoshaphat, they all thought that he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat gave a shout, and the LORD God rescued him and turned the attack away from him. 
142Ch 18:32 The chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, so they stopped pursuing him. 
142Ch 18:33 By chance, however, a Syrian soldier shot an arrow which struck King Ahab between the joints of his armor. "I'm wounded!" he cried out to his chariot driver. "Turn around and pull out of the battle!" 
142Ch 18:34 While the battle raged on, King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. At sunset he died. 
142Ch 19:1 King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 19:2 A prophet, Jehu son of Hanani, went to meet the king and said to him, "Do you think it is right to help those who are wicked and to take the side of those who hate the LORD? What you have done has brought the LORD's anger on you. 
142Ch 19:3 But even so, there is some good in you. You have removed all the symbols of the goddess Asherah which people worshiped, and you have tried to follow God's will." 
142Ch 19:4 Even though King Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, he traveled regularly among the people, from Beersheba in the south to the edge of the hill country of Ephraim in the north, in order to call the people back to the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 19:5 He appointed judges in each of the fortified cities of Judah 
142Ch 19:6 and instructed them�� "Be careful in pronouncing judgment; you are not acting on human authority, but on the authority of the LORD, and he is with you when you pass sentence. 
142Ch 19:7 Honor the LORD and act carefully, because the LORD our God does not tolerate fraud or partiality or the taking of bribes." 
142Ch 19:8 In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and some of the leading citizens as judges in cases involving a violation of the Law of the LORD or legal disputes between inhabitants of the city. 
142Ch 19:9 He gave them the following instructions�� "You must perform your duties in reverence for the LORD, faithfully obeying him in everything you do. 
142Ch 19:10 Whenever your fellow citizens from any of the cities bring before you a case of homicide or any other violation of a law or commandment, you must instruct them carefully how to conduct themselves during the trial, so that they do not become guilty of sinning against the LORD. Unless you do, you and your fellow citizens will feel the force of the LORD's anger. But if you do your duty, you will not be guilty. 
142Ch 19:11 Amariah the High Priest will have final authority in all religious cases, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, governor of Judah, will have final authority in all civil cases. The Levites have the responsibility of seeing that the decisions of the courts are carried out. Be courageous and carry out these instructions, and may the LORD be on the side of the right!" 
142Ch 20:1 Some time later the armies of Moab and Ammon, together with their allies, the Meunites, invaded Judah. 
142Ch 20:2 Some messengers came and announced to King Jehoshaphat�� "A large army from Edom has come from the other side of the Dead Sea to attack you. They have already captured Hazazon Tamar." (This is another name for Engedi.) 
142Ch 20:3 Jehoshaphat was frightened and prayed to the LORD for guidance. Then he gave orders for a fast to be observed throughout the country. 
142Ch 20:4 From every city of Judah people hurried to Jerusalem to ask the LORD for guidance, 
142Ch 20:5 and they and the people of Jerusalem gathered in the new courtyard of the Temple. King Jehoshaphat went and stood before them 
142Ch 20:6 and prayed aloud, "O LORD God of our ancestors, you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world. You are powerful and mighty, and no one can oppose you. 
142Ch 20:7 You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs forever. 
142Ch 20:8 They have lived here and have built a temple to honor you, knowing 
142Ch 20:9 that if any disaster struck them to punish them - a war, an epidemic, or a famine - then they could come and stand in front of this Temple where you are worshiped. They could pray to you in their trouble, and you would hear them and rescue them. 
142Ch 20:10 "Now the people of Ammon, Moab, and Edom have attacked us. When our ancestors came out of Egypt, you did not allow them to enter those lands, so our ancestors went around them and did not destroy them. 
142Ch 20:11 This is how they repay us - they come to drive us out of the land that you gave us. 
142Ch 20:12 You are our God! Punish them, for we are helpless in the face of this large army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but we look to you for help." 
142Ch 20:13 All the men of Judah, with their wives and children, were standing there at the Temple. 
142Ch 20:14 The spirit of the LORD came upon a Levite who was present in the crowd. His name was Jahaziel son of Zechariah; he was a member of the clan of Asaph and was descended from Asaph through Mattaniah, Jeiel, and Benaiah. 
142Ch 20:15 Jahaziel said, "Your Majesty and all you people of Judah and Jerusalem, the LORD says that you must not be discouraged or be afraid to face this large army. The battle depends on God, not on you. 
142Ch 20:16 Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz. You will meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel. 
142Ch 20:17 You will not have to fight this battle. Just take up your positions and wait; you will see the LORD give you victory. People of Judah and Jerusalem, do not hesitate or be afraid. Go out to battle, and the LORD will be with you!" 
142Ch 20:18 Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low, with his face touching the ground, and all the people bowed with him and worshiped the LORD. 
142Ch 20:19 The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised the LORD, the God of Israel. 
142Ch 20:20 Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa. As they were starting out, Jehoshaphat addressed them with these words�� "People of Judah and Jerusalem! Put your trust in the LORD your God, and you will stand your ground. Believe what his prophets tell you, and you will succeed." 
142Ch 20:21 After consulting with the people, the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army, singing�� "Praise the LORD! His love is eternal!" 
142Ch 20:22 When they began to sing, the LORD threw the invading armies into a panic. 
142Ch 20:23 The Ammonites and the Moabites attacked the Edomite army and completely destroyed it, and then they turned on each other in savage fighting. 
142Ch 20:24 When the Judean army reached a tower that was in the desert, they looked toward the enemy and saw that they were all lying on the ground dead. Not one had escaped. 
142Ch 20:25 Jehoshaphat and his troops moved in to take the loot, and they found many cattle, supplies, clothing, and other valuable objects. They spent three days gathering the loot, but there was so much that they could not take everything. 
142Ch 20:26 On the fourth day they assembled in Beracah Valley and praised the LORD for all he had done. That is why the valley is called "Beracah." 
142Ch 20:27 Jehoshaphat led his troops back to Jerusalem in triumph, because the LORD had defeated their enemies. 
142Ch 20:28 When they reached the city, they marched to the Temple to the music of harps and trumpets. 
142Ch 20:29 Every nation that heard how the LORD had defeated Israel's enemies was terrified, 
142Ch 20:30 so Jehoshaphat ruled in peace, and God gave him security on every side. 
142Ch 20:31 Jehoshaphat had become king of Judah at the age of thirty-five and had ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
142Ch 20:32 Like his father Asa before him, he did what was right in the sight of the LORD; 
142Ch 20:33 but the pagan places of worship were not destroyed. The people still did not turn wholeheartedly to the worship of the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 20:34 Everything else that Jehoshaphat did, from the beginning of his reign to its end, is recorded in The History of Jehu Son of Hanani,which is a part of The History of the Kings of Israel.
142Ch 20:35 At one time King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who did many wicked things. 
142Ch 20:36 At the port of Eziongeber they built ocean-going ships. 
142Ch 20:37 But Eliezer son of Dodavahu, from the town of Mareshah, warned Jehoshaphat, "Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have built." And the ships were wrecked and never sailed. 
142Ch 21:1 Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 21:2 Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah had six brothers�� Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. 
142Ch 21:3 Their father gave them large amounts of gold, silver, and other valuable possessions, and placed each one in charge of one of the fortified cities of Judah. But because Jehoram was the oldest, Jehoshaphat made him his successor. 
142Ch 21:4 When Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom, he had all his brothers killed, and also some Israelite officials. 
142Ch 21:5 Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. 
142Ch 21:6 He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel, because he had married one of Ahab's daughters. He sinned against the LORD, 
142Ch 21:7 but the LORD was not willing to destroy the dynasty of David, because he had made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would always continue to rule. 
142Ch 21:8 During Jehoram's reign Edom revolted against Judah and became an independent kingdom. 
142Ch 21:9 So Jehoram and his officers set out with chariots and invaded Edom. There the Edomite army surrounded them, but during the night they managed to break out and escape. 
142Ch 21:10 Edom has been independent of Judah ever since. During this same period the city of Libnah also revolted, because Jehoram had abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors. 
142Ch 21:11 He even built pagan places of worship in the Judean highlands and led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to sin against the LORD. 
142Ch 21:12 The prophet Elijah sent Jehoram a letter, which read as follows�� "The LORD, the God of your ancestor David, condemns you, because you did not follow the example of your father, King Jehoshaphat, or that of your grandfather, King Asa. 
142Ch 21:13 Instead, you have followed the example of the kings of Israel and have led the people of Judah and Jerusalem into being unfaithful to God, just as Ahab and his successors led Israel into unfaithfulness. You even murdered your brothers, who were better men than you are. 
142Ch 21:14 As a result, the LORD will severely punish your people, your children, and your wives, and will destroy your possessions. 
142Ch 21:15 You yourself will suffer a painful intestinal disease that will grow worse day by day." 
142Ch 21:16 Some Philistines and Arabs lived near where some Ethiopians had settled along the coast. The LORD caused them to go to war against Jehoram. 
142Ch 21:17 They invaded Judah, looted the royal palace, and carried off as prisoners all the king's wives and sons except Ahaziah, his youngest son. 
142Ch 21:18 Then after all this, the LORD brought on the king a painful disease of the intestines. 
142Ch 21:19 For almost two years it grew steadily worse until finally the king died in agony. His subjects did not light a bonfire in mourning for him as had been done for his ancestors. 
142Ch 21:20 Jehoram had become king at the age of thirty-two and had ruled in Jerusalem for eight years. Nobody was sorry when he died. They buried him in David's City, but not in the royal tombs. 
142Ch 22:1 Some Arabs had led a raid and killed all of King Jehoram's sons except Ahaziah, the youngest. So now the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah king as his father's successor. 
142Ch 22:2 Ahaziah became king at the age of twenty-two, and he ruled in Jerusalem for one year.
142Ch 22:3 Ahaziah also followed the example of King Ahab's family, since his mother Athaliah - the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel - gave him advice that led him into evil.
142Ch 22:4 He sinned against the LORD, because after his father's death other members of King Ahab's family became his advisers, and they led to his downfall. 
142Ch 22:5 Following their advice, he joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle. 
142Ch 22:6 He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds, and Ahaziah went there to visit him. 
142Ch 22:7 God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziah's downfall. While Ahaziah was there, he and Joram were confronted by a man named Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had chosen to destroy the dynasty of Ahab. 
142Ch 22:8 As Jehu was carrying out God's sentence on the dynasty, he came across a group made up of Judean leaders and of Ahaziah's nephews that had accompanied Ahaziah on his visit. Jehu killed them all. 
142Ch 22:9 A search was made for Ahaziah, and he was found hiding in Samaria. They took him to Jehu and put him to death. But they did bury his body out of respect for his grandfather King Jehoshaphat, who had done all he could to serve the LORD. No member of Ahaziah's family was left who could rule the kingdom. 
142Ch 22:10 As soon as King Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned of her son's murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family of Judah to be killed. 
142Ch 22:11 Ahaziah had a half sister, Jehosheba, who was married to a priest named Jehoiada. She secretly rescued one of Ahaziah's sons, Joash, took him away from the other princes who were about to be murdered and hid him and a nurse in a bedroom at the Temple. By keeping him hidden, she saved him from death at the hands of Athaliah. 
142Ch 22:12 For six years he remained there in hiding, while Athaliah ruled as queen. 
142Ch 23:1 After waiting six years Jehoiada the priest decided that it was time to take action. He made a pact with five army officers�� Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri. 
142Ch 23:2 They traveled to all the cities of Judah and brought back with them to Jerusalem the Levites and all the heads of the clans. 
142Ch 23:3 They all gathered in the Temple, and there they made a covenant with Joash, the king's son. Jehoiada said to them, "Here is the son of the late king. He is now to be king, as the LORD promised that King David's descendants would be. 
142Ch 23:4 This is what we will do. When the priests and Levites come on duty on the Sabbath, one third of them will guard the Temple gates, 
142Ch 23:5 another third will guard the royal palace, and the rest will be stationed at the Foundation Gate. All the people will assemble in the Temple courtyard. 
142Ch 23:6 No one is to enter the Temple buildings except the priests and the Levites who are on duty. They may enter, because they are consecrated, but the rest of the people must obey the LORD's instructions and stay outside. 
142Ch 23:7 The Levites are to stand guard around the king, with their swords drawn, and are to stay with the king wherever he goes. Anyone who tries to enter the Temple is to be killed." 
142Ch 23:8 The Levites and the people of Judah carried out Jehoiada's instructions. The men were not dismissed when they went off duty on the Sabbath, so the commanders had available both those coming on duty and those going off. 
142Ch 23:9 Jehoiada gave the officers the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and had been kept in the Temple. 
142Ch 23:10 He stationed the men with drawn swords all around the front of the Temple, to protect the king. 
142Ch 23:11 Then Jehoiada led Joash out, placed the crown on his head, and gave him a copy of the laws governing kingship. And so he was made king. Jehoiada the priest and his sons anointed Joash, and everyone shouted, "Long live the king!" 
142Ch 23:12 Athaliah heard the people cheering for the king, so she hurried to the Temple, where the crowd had gathered. 
142Ch 23:13 There she saw the new king at the Temple entrance, standing by the column reserved for kings and surrounded by the army officers and the trumpeters. All the people were shouting joyfully and blowing trumpets, and the Temple musicians with their instruments were leading the celebration. She tore her clothes in distress and shouted, "Treason! Treason!" 
142Ch 23:14 Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area, so he called out the army officers and said, "Take her out between the rows of guards, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her." 
142Ch 23:15 They seized her, took her to the palace, and there at the Horse Gate they killed her. 
142Ch 23:16 The priest Jehoiada had King Joash and the people join him in making a covenant that they would be the LORD's people. 
142Ch 23:17 Then they all went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols there and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
142Ch 23:18 Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple. They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David and to burn the sacrifices offered to the LORD in accordance with the Law of Moses. They were also in charge of the music and the celebrations. 
142Ch 23:19 Jehoiada also put guards on duty at the Temple gates to keep out anyone who was ritually unclean. 
142Ch 23:20 The army officers, the leading citizens, the officials, and all the rest of the people joined Jehoiada in a procession that brought the king from the Temple to the palace. They entered by the main gate, and the king took his place on the throne. 
142Ch 23:21 All the people were filled with happiness, and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been killed. 
142Ch 24:1 Joash became king of Judah at the age of seven, and he ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother was Zibiah from the city of Beersheba. 
142Ch 24:2 He did what was pleasing to the LORD as long as Jehoiada the priest was alive. 
142Ch 24:3 Jehoiada chose two wives for King Joash, and they bore him sons and daughters. 
142Ch 24:4 After he had been king for a while, Joash decided to have the Temple repaired. 
142Ch 24:5 He ordered the priests and the Levites to go to the cities of Judah and collect from all the people enough money to make the annual repairs on the Temple. He told them to act promptly, but the Levites delayed, 
142Ch 24:6 so he called in Jehoiada, their leader, and demanded, "Why haven't you seen to it that the Levites collect from Judah and Jerusalem the tax which Moses, the servant of the LORD, required the people to pay for support of the Tent of the LORD's presence?" 
142Ch 24:7 (The followers of Athaliah, that corrupt woman, had damaged the Temple and had used many of the sacred objects in the worship of Baal.) 
142Ch 24:8 The king ordered the Levites to make a box for contributions and to place it at the Temple gate. 
142Ch 24:9 They sent word throughout Jerusalem and Judah for everyone to bring to the LORD the tax which Moses, God's servant, had first collected in the wilderness. 
142Ch 24:10 This pleased the people and their leaders, and they brought their tax money and filled the box with it. 
142Ch 24:11 Every day the Levites would take the box to the royal official who was in charge of it. Whenever it was full, the royal secretary and the High Priest's representative would take the money out and return the box to its place. And so they collected a large sum of money. 
142Ch 24:12 The king and Jehoiada would give the money to those who were in charge of repairing the Temple, and they hired stonemasons, carpenters, and metalworkers to make the repairs. 
142Ch 24:13 All of them worked hard, and they restored the Temple to its original condition, as solid as ever. 
142Ch 24:14 When the repairs were finished, the remaining gold and silver was given to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to have bowls and other utensils made for the Temple. As long as Jehoiada was alive, sacrifices were offered regularly at the Temple. 
142Ch 24:15 After reaching the very old age of a hundred and thirty, he died. 
142Ch 24:16 They buried him in the royal tombs in David's City in recognition of the service he had done for the people of Israel, for God, and for the Temple. 
142Ch 24:17 But once Jehoiada was dead, the leaders of Judah persuaded King Joash to listen to them instead. 
142Ch 24:18 And so the people stopped worshiping in the Temple of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and began to worship idols and the images of the goddess Asherah. Their guilt for these sins brought the LORD's anger on Judah and Jerusalem. 
142Ch 24:19 The LORD sent prophets to warn them to return to him, but the people refused to listen. 
142Ch 24:20 Then the spirit of God took control of Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood where the people could see him and called out, "The LORD God asks why you have disobeyed his commands and are bringing disaster on yourselves! You abandoned him, so he has abandoned you!" 
142Ch 24:21 King Joash joined in a conspiracy against Zechariah, and on the king's orders the people stoned Zechariah in the Temple courtyard. 
142Ch 24:22 The king forgot about the loyal service that Zechariah's father Jehoiada had given him, and he had Zechariah killed. As Zechariah was dying, he called out, "May the LORD see what you are doing and punish you!" 
142Ch 24:23 When autumn came that year, the Syrian army attacked Judah and Jerusalem, killed all the leaders, and took large amounts of loot back to Damascus. 
142Ch 24:24 The Syrian army was small, but the LORD let them defeat a much larger Judean army because the people had abandoned him, the LORD God of their ancestors. In this way King Joash was punished. 
142Ch 24:25 He was severely wounded, and when the enemy withdrew, two of his officials plotted against him and killed him in his bed to avenge the murder of the son of Jehoiada the priest. He was buried in David's City, but not in the royal tombs. 
142Ch 24:26 (Those who plotted against him were Zabad, the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith.) 
142Ch 24:27 The Commentary on the Book of Kings contains the stories of the sons of Joash, the prophecies spoken against him, and the record of how he rebuilt the Temple. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
142Ch 25:1 Amaziah became king at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem. 
142Ch 25:2 He did what was pleasing to the LORD, but did it reluctantly. 
142Ch 25:3 As soon as he was firmly in power, he executed the officials who had murdered his father. 
142Ch 25:4 He did not, however, execute their children, but followed what the LORD had commanded in the Law of Moses�� "Parents are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their children, and children are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their parents; people are to be put to death only for crimes they themselves have committed." 
142Ch 25:5 King Amaziah organized all the men of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin into army units, according to the clans they belonged to, and placed officers in command of units of a thousand and units of a hundred. This included all men twenty years of age or older, 300,000 in all. They were picked troops, ready for battle, skilled in using spears and shields. 
142Ch 25:6 In addition, he hired 100,000 soldiers from Israel at a cost of about four tons of silver. 
142Ch 25:7 But a prophet went to the king and said to him, "Don't take these Israelite soldiers with you. The LORD is not with these people from the Northern Kingdom. 
142Ch 25:8 You may think that they will make you stronger in battle, but it is God who has the power to give victory or defeat, and he will let your enemies defeat you." 
142Ch 25:9 Amaziah asked the prophet, "But what about all that silver I have already paid for them?" The prophet replied, "The LORD can give you back more than that!" 
142Ch 25:10 So Amaziah sent the hired troops away and told them to go home. At this they went home, bitterly angry with the people of Judah. 
142Ch 25:11 Amaziah summoned up his courage and led his army to Salt Valley. There they fought and killed ten thousand Edomite soldiers 
142Ch 25:12 and captured another ten thousand. They took the prisoners to the top of the cliff at the city of Sela and threw them off, so that they were killed on the rocks below. 
142Ch 25:13 Meanwhile the Israelite soldiers that Amaziah had not allowed to go into battle with him attacked the Judean cities between Samaria and Beth Horon, killed three thousand men, and captured quantities of loot. 
142Ch 25:14 When Amaziah returned from defeating the Edomites, he brought their idols back with him, set them up, worshiped them, and burned incense to them. 
142Ch 25:15 This made the LORD angry, so he sent a prophet to Amaziah. The prophet demanded, "Why have you worshiped foreign gods that could not even save their own people from your power?" 
142Ch 25:16 "Since when," Amaziah interrupted, "have we made you adviser to the king? Stop talking, or I'll have you killed!" The prophet stopped, but not before saying, "Now I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done all this and have ignored my advice." 
142Ch 25:17 King Amaziah of Judah and his advisers plotted against Israel. He then sent a message to King Jehoash of Israel, who was the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu, challenging him to fight. 
142Ch 25:18 Jehoash sent this answer to Amaziah�� "Once a thorn bush in the Lebanon Mountains sent a message to a cedar�� 'Give your daughter in marriage to my son.' A wild animal passed by and trampled the bush down. 
142Ch 25:19 Now Amaziah, you boast that you have defeated the Edomites, but I advise you to stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and your people?" 
142Ch 25:20 But Amaziah refused to listen. It was God's will for Amaziah to be defeated, because he had worshiped the Edomite idols. 
142Ch 25:21 So King Jehoash of Israel went into battle against King Amaziah of Judah. They met at Beth Shemesh in Judah, 
142Ch 25:22 the Judean army was defeated, and the soldiers fled to their homes. 
142Ch 25:23 Jehoash captured Amaziah and took him to Jerusalem. There he tore down the city wall from Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, a distance of two hundred yards. 
142Ch 25:24 He took back to Samaria as loot all the gold and silver in the Temple, the Temple equipment guarded by the descendants of Obed Edom, and the palace treasures. He also took hostages with him. 
142Ch 25:25 King Amaziah of Judah outlived King Jehoash of Israel by fifteen years. 
142Ch 25:26 All the other things that Amaziah did from the beginning to the end of his reign are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 25:27 Ever since the time when he rebelled against the LORD, there had been a plot against him in Jerusalem. Finally he fled to the city of Lachish, but his enemies followed him there and killed him. 
142Ch 25:28 His body was carried to Jerusalem on a horse, and he was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. 
142Ch 26:1 All the people of Judah chose Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son Uzziah to succeed his father as king. 
142Ch 26:2 (It was after the death of Amaziah that Uzziah recaptured Elath and rebuilt the city.) 
142Ch 26:3 Uzziah became king at the age of sixteen, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem. 
142Ch 26:4 Following the example of his father, he did what was pleasing to the LORD. 
142Ch 26:5 As long as Zechariah, his religious adviser, was living, he served the LORD faithfully, and God blessed him. 
142Ch 26:6 Uzziah went to war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls of the cities of Gath, Jamnia, and Ashdod, and built fortified cities near Ashdod and in the rest of Philistia. 
142Ch 26:7 God helped him defeat the Philistines, the Arabs living at Gurbaal, and the Meunites. 
142Ch 26:8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and he became so powerful that his fame spread even to Egypt. 
142Ch 26:9 Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem by building towers at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and where the wall turned. 
142Ch 26:10 He also built fortified towers in the open country and dug many cisterns, because he had large herds of livestock in the western foothills and plains. Because he loved farming, he encouraged the people to plant vineyards in the hill country and to farm the fertile land. 
142Ch 26:11 He had a large army ready for battle. Its records were kept by his secretaries Jeiel and Maaseiah under the supervision of Hananiah, a member of the king's staff. 
142Ch 26:12 The army was commanded by 2,600 officers. 
142Ch 26:13 Under them were 307,500 soldiers able to fight effectively for the king against his enemies. 
142Ch 26:14 Uzziah supplied the army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and arrows, and stones for slinging. 
142Ch 26:15 In Jerusalem his inventors made equipment for shooting arrows and for throwing large stones from the towers and corners of the city wall. His fame spread everywhere, and he became very powerful because of the help he received from God. 
142Ch 26:16 But when King Uzziah became strong, he grew arrogant, and that led to his downfall. He defied the LORD his God by going into the Temple to burn incense on the altar of incense. 
142Ch 26:17 Azariah the priest, accompanied by eighty strong and courageous priests, followed the king 
142Ch 26:18 to resist him. They said, "Uzziah! You have no right to burn incense to the LORD. Only the priests who are descended from Aaron have been consecrated to do this. Leave this holy place. You have offended the LORD God, and you no longer have his blessing." 
142Ch 26:19 Uzziah was standing there in the Temple beside the incense altar and was holding an incense burner. He became angry with the priests, and immediately a dreaded skin disease broke out on his forehead. 
142Ch 26:20 Azariah and the other priests stared at the king's forehead in horror and then forced him to leave the Temple. He hurried to get out, because the LORD had punished him. 
142Ch 26:21 For the rest of his life King Uzziah was ritually unclean because of his disease. Unable to enter the Temple again, he lived in his own house, relieved of all duties, while his son Jotham governed the country. 
142Ch 26:22 The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz recorded all the other things that King Uzziah did during his reign. 
142Ch 26:23 Uzziah died and was buried in the royal burial ground, but because of his disease he was not buried in the royal tombs. His son Jotham succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 27:1 Jotham became king at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. His mother was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
142Ch 27:2 He did what was pleasing to the LORD, just as his father had done; but unlike his father he did not sin by burning incense in the Temple. The people, however, went on sinning. 
142Ch 27:3 It was Jotham who built the North Gate of the Temple and did extensive work on the city wall in the area of Jerusalem called Ophel. 
142Ch 27:4 In the mountains of Judah he built cities, and in the forests he built forts and towers. 
142Ch 27:5 He fought against the king of Ammon and his army and defeated them. Then he forced the Ammonites to pay him the following tribute each year for three years�� four tons of silver, fifty thousand bushels of wheat, and fifty thousand bushels of barley. 
142Ch 27:6 Jotham grew powerful because he faithfully obeyed the LORD his God. 
142Ch 27:7 The other events of Jotham's reign, his wars, and his policies, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 27:8 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. 
142Ch 27:9 He died and was buried in David's City and his son Ahaz succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 28:1 Ahaz became king at the age of twenty, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not follow the good example of his ancestor King David; instead, he did what was not pleasing to the LORD 
142Ch 28:2 and followed the example of the kings of Israel. He had metal images of Baal made, 
142Ch 28:3 burned incense in Hinnom Valley, and even sacrificed his own sons as burnt offerings to idols, imitating the disgusting practice of the people whom the LORD had driven out of the land as the Israelites advanced. 
142Ch 28:4 At the pagan places of worship, on the hills, and under every shady tree Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense. 
142Ch 28:5 Because King Ahaz sinned, the LORD his God let the king of Syria defeat him and take a large number of Judeans back to Damascus as prisoners. The LORD also let the king of Israel, Pekah son of Remaliah, defeat Ahaz and kill 120,000 of the bravest Judean soldiers in one day. 
142Ch 28:6 The LORD, the God of their ancestors, permitted this to happen, because the people of Judah had abandoned him. 
142Ch 28:7 An Israelite soldier named Zichri killed King Ahaz' son Maaseiah, the palace administrator Azrikam, and Elkanah, who was second in command to the king. 
142Ch 28:8 Even though the Judeans were their own relatives, the Israelite army captured 200,000 women and children as prisoners and took them back to Samaria, along with large amounts of loot. 
142Ch 28:9 A man named Oded, a prophet of the LORD, lived in the city of Samaria. He met the returning Israelite army with its Judean prisoners as it was about to enter the city, and he said, "The LORD God of your ancestors was angry with Judah and let you defeat them, but now he has heard of the vicious way you slaughtered them. 
142Ch 28:10 And now you intend to make the men and women of Jerusalem and Judah your slaves. Don't you know that you also have committed sins against the LORD your God? 
142Ch 28:11 Listen to me! These prisoners are your brothers and sisters. Let them go, or the LORD will punish you in his anger." 
142Ch 28:12 Four of the leading men of the Northern Kingdom, Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai also opposed the actions of the army. 
142Ch 28:13 They said, "Don't bring those prisoners here! We have already sinned against the LORD and made him angry enough to punish us. Now you want to do something that will increase our guilt." 
142Ch 28:14 So then the army handed the prisoners and the loot over to the people and their leaders, 
142Ch 28:15 and the four men were appointed to provide the prisoners with clothing from the captured loot. They gave them clothes and sandals to wear, gave them enough to eat and drink, and put olive oil on their wounds. Those who were too weak to walk were put on donkeys, and all the prisoners were taken back to Judean territory at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then the Israelites returned home to Samaria. 
142Ch 28:16 The Edomites began to raid Judah again and captured many prisoners, 
142Ch 28:17 so King Ahaz asked Tiglath Pileser, the emperor of Assyria, to send help. 
142Ch 28:18 At this same time the Philistines were raiding the towns in the western foothills and in southern Judah. They captured the cities of Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, and the cities of Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages, and settled there permanently. 
142Ch 28:19 Because King Ahaz of Judah had violated the rights of his people and had defied the LORD, the LORD brought troubles on Judah. 
142Ch 28:20 The Assyrian emperor, instead of helping Ahaz, opposed him and caused him trouble. 
142Ch 28:21 So Ahaz took the gold from the Temple, the palace, and the homes of the leaders of the people, and gave it to the emperor, but even this did not help. 
142Ch 28:22 When his troubles were at their worst, that man Ahaz sinned against the LORD more than ever. 
142Ch 28:23 He offered sacrifices to the gods of the Syrians, who had defeated him. He said, "The Syrian gods helped the kings of Syria, so if I sacrifice to them, they may help me too." This brought disaster on him and on his nation. 
142Ch 28:24 In addition, he took all the Temple equipment and broke it in pieces. He closed the Temple and set up altars in every part of Jerusalem. 
142Ch 28:25 In every city and town in Judah he built pagan places of worship, where incense was to be burned to foreign gods. In this way he brought on himself the anger of the LORD, the God of his ancestors. 
142Ch 28:26 All the other events of his reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 28:27 King Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 29:1 Hezekiah became king of Judah at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
142Ch 29:2 Following the example of his ancestor King David, he did what was pleasing to the LORD. 
142Ch 29:3 In the first month of the year after Hezekiah became king, he reopened the gates of the Temple and had them repaired. 
142Ch 29:4 He assembled a group of priests and Levites in the east courtyard of the Temple 
142Ch 29:5 and spoke to them there. He said, "You Levites are to consecrate yourselves and purify the Temple of the LORD, the God of your ancestors. Remove from the Temple everything that defiles it. 
142Ch 29:6 Our ancestors were unfaithful to the LORD our God and did what was displeasing to him. They abandoned him and turned their backs on the place where he dwells. 
142Ch 29:7 They closed the doors of the Temple, let the lamps go out, and failed to burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the Temple of the God of Israel. 
142Ch 29:8 Because of this the LORD has been angry with Judah and Jerusalem, and what he has done to them has shocked and frightened everyone. You know this very well. 
142Ch 29:9 Our fathers were killed in battle, and our wives and children have been taken away as prisoners. 
142Ch 29:10 "I have now decided to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that he will no longer be angry with us. 
142Ch 29:11 My sons, do not lose any time. You are the ones that the LORD has chosen to burn incense to him and to lead the people in worshiping him." 
142Ch 29:12 The following Levites were there�� From the clan of Kohath, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah From the clan of Merari,
142Ch 29:13 Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel From the clan of Gershon, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah From the clan of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel From the clan of Asaph, 
142Ch 29:14 Zechariah and Mattaniah From the clan of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei From the clan of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
142Ch 29:15 These men assembled their fellow Levites, and they all made themselves ritually clean. Then, as the king had commanded them to do, they began to make the Temple ritually clean, according to the Law of the LORD. 
142Ch 29:16 The priests went inside the Temple to purify it, and they carried out into the Temple courtyard everything that was ritually unclean. From there the Levites took it all outside the city to Kidron Valley. 
142Ch 29:17 The work was begun on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day they had finished it all, including the entrance room to the Temple. Then they worked for the next eight days, until the sixteenth of the month, preparing the Temple for worship. 
142Ch 29:18 The Levites made the following report to King Hezekiah�� "We have completed the ritual purification of the whole Temple, including the altar for burnt offerings, the table for the sacred bread, and all their equipment. 
142Ch 29:19 We have also brought back all the equipment which King Ahaz took away during those years he was unfaithful to God, and we have rededicated it. It is all in front of the LORD's altar." 
142Ch 29:20 Without delay King Hezekiah assembled the leading men of the city, and together they went to the Temple. 
142Ch 29:21 As an offering to take away the sins of the royal family and of the people of Judah and to purify the Temple, they took seven bulls, seven sheep, seven lambs, and seven goats. The king told the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to offer the animals as sacrifices on the altar. 
142Ch 29:22 The priests killed the bulls first, then the sheep, and then the lambs, and sprinkled the blood of each sacrifice on the altar. 
142Ch 29:23 Finally they took the goats to the king and to the other worshipers, who laid their hands on them. 
142Ch 29:24 Then the priests killed the goats and poured their blood on the altar as a sacrifice to take away the sin of all the people, for the king had commanded that burnt offerings and sin offerings be made for all Israel. 
142Ch 29:25 The king followed the instructions that the LORD had given to King David through Gad, the king's prophet, and through the prophet Nathan; he stationed Levites in the Temple, with harps and cymbals, 
142Ch 29:26 instruments like those that King David had used. The priests also stood there with trumpets. 
142Ch 29:27 Hezekiah gave the order for the burnt offering to be presented; and as the offering began, the people sang praise to the LORD, and the musicians began to play the trumpets and all the other instruments. 
142Ch 29:28 Everyone who was there joined in worship, and the singing and the rest of the music continued until all the sacrifices had been burned. 
142Ch 29:29 Then King Hezekiah and all the people knelt down and worshiped God. 
142Ch 29:30 The king and the leaders of the nation told the Levites to sing to the LORD the songs of praise that were written by David and by Asaph the prophet. So everyone sang with great joy as they knelt and worshiped God. 
142Ch 29:31 Hezekiah said to the people, "Now that you are ritually clean, bring sacrifices as offerings of thanksgiving to the LORD." They obeyed, and some of them also voluntarily brought animals to be sacrificed as burnt offerings. 
142Ch 29:32 They brought 70 bulls, 100 sheep, and 200 lambs as burnt offerings for the LORD; 
142Ch 29:33 they also brought 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep as sacrifices for the people to eat. 
142Ch 29:34 Since there were not enough priests to kill all these animals, the Levites helped them until the work was finished. By then more priests had made themselves ritually clean. (The Levites were more faithful in keeping ritually clean than the priests were.) 
142Ch 29:35 In addition to offering the sacrifices that were burned whole, the priests were responsible for burning the fat that was offered from the sacrifices which the people ate, and for pouring out the wine that was presented with the burnt offerings. And so worship in the Temple was begun again. 
142Ch 29:36 King Hezekiah and the people were happy, because God had helped them to do all this so quickly. 
142Ch 30:1 The people had not been able to celebrate the Passover Festival at the proper time in the first month, because not enough priests were ritually clean and not many people had assembled in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 30:2 So King Hezekiah, his officials, and the people of Jerusalem agreed to celebrate it in the second month, and the king sent word to all the people of Israel and Judah. 
142Ch 30:3 He took special care to send letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the Temple in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover in honor of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
142Ch 30:4 The king and the people were pleased with their plan, 
142Ch 30:5 so they invited all the Israelites, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, to come together in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover according to the Law, in larger numbers than ever before. 
142Ch 30:6 Messengers went out at the command of the king and his officials through all Judah and Israel with the following invitation�� "People of Israel, you have survived the Assyrian conquest of the land. Now return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he will return to you. 
142Ch 30:7 Do not be like your ancestors and your Israelite relatives who were unfaithful to the LORD their God. As you can see, he punished them severely. 
142Ch 30:8 Do not be stubborn as they were, but obey the LORD. Come to the Temple in Jerusalem, which the LORD your God has made holy forever, and worship him so that he will no longer be angry with you. 
142Ch 30:9 If you return to the LORD, then those who have taken your relatives away as prisoners will take pity on them and let them come back home. The LORD your God is kind and merciful, and if you return to him, he will accept you." 
142Ch 30:10 The messengers went to every city in the territory of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far north as the tribe of Zebulun, but people laughed at them and made fun of them. 
142Ch 30:11 Still, there were some from the tribes of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun who were willing to come to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 30:12 God was also at work in Judah and united the people in their determination to obey his will by following the commands of the king and his officials. 
142Ch 30:13 A great number of people gathered in Jerusalem in the second month to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
142Ch 30:14 They took all the altars that had been used in Jerusalem for offering sacrifices and burning incense and threw them into Kidron Valley. 
142Ch 30:15 And on the fourteenth day of the month they killed the lambs for the Passover sacrifice. The priests and Levites who were not ritually clean became so ashamed that they dedicated themselves to the LORD, and now they could sacrifice burnt offerings in the Temple. 
142Ch 30:16 They took their places in the Temple according to the instructions in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The Levites gave the blood of the sacrifices to the priests, who sprinkled it on the altar. 
142Ch 30:17 Because many of the people were not ritually clean, they could not kill the Passover lambs, so the Levites did it for them and dedicated the lambs to the LORD. 
142Ch 30:18 In addition, many of those who had come from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not performed the ritual of purification, and so they were observing Passover improperly. King Hezekiah offered this prayer for them��
142Ch 30:19 "O LORD, the God of our ancestors, in your goodness forgive those who are worshiping you with all their heart, even though they are not ritually clean." 
142Ch 30:20 The LORD answered Hezekiah's prayer; he forgave the people and did not harm them. 
142Ch 30:21 For seven days the people who had gathered in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread with great joy, and day after day the Levites and the priests praised the LORD with all their strength. 
142Ch 30:22 Hezekiah praised the Levites for their skill in conducting the worship of the LORD. After the seven days during which they offered sacrifices in praise of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, 
142Ch 30:23 they all decided to celebrate for another seven days. So they celebrated with joy. 
142Ch 30:24 King Hezekiah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for the people to kill and eat, and the officials gave them another 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. A large number of priests went through the ritual of purification. 
142Ch 30:25 So everyone was happy - the people of Judah, the priests, the Levites, the people who had come from the north, and the foreigners who had settled permanently in Israel and Judah. 
142Ch 30:26 The city of Jerusalem was filled with joy, because nothing like this had happened since the days of King Solomon, the son of David. 
142Ch 30:27 The priests and the Levites asked the LORD's blessing on the people. In his home in heaven God heard their prayers and accepted them. 
142Ch 31:1 After the festival ended, all the people of Israel went to every city in Judah and broke the stone pillars, cut down the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and destroyed the altars and the pagan places of worship. They did the same thing throughout the rest of Judah, and the territories of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh; then they all returned home. 
142Ch 31:2 King Hezekiah reestablished the organization of the priests and Levites, under which they each had specific duties. These included offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, taking part in the Temple worship, and giving praise and thanks in the various parts of the Temple. 
142Ch 31:3 From his own flocks and herds he provided animals for the burnt offerings each morning and evening, and for those offered on the Sabbath, at the New Moon Festival, and at the other festivals which are required by the Law of the LORD. 
142Ch 31:4 In addition, the king told the people of Jerusalem to bring the offerings to which the priests and the Levites were entitled, so that they could give all their time to the requirements of the Law of the LORD. 
142Ch 31:5 As soon as the order was given, the people of Israel brought gifts of their finest grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other farm produce, and they also brought the tithes of everything they had. 
142Ch 31:6 All the people who lived in the cities of Judah brought tithes of their cattle and sheep, and they also brought large quantities of gifts which they dedicated to the LORD their God. 
142Ch 31:7 The gifts started arriving in the third month and continued to pile up for the next four months. 
142Ch 31:8 When King Hezekiah and his officials saw how much had been given, they praised the LORD and praised his people Israel. 
142Ch 31:9 The king spoke to the priests and the Levites about these gifts, 
142Ch 31:10 and Azariah the High Priest, a descendant of Zadok, said to him, "Since the people started bringing their gifts to the Temple, there has been enough to eat and a large surplus besides. We have all this because the LORD has blessed his people." 
142Ch 31:11 On the king's orders they prepared storerooms in the Temple area 
142Ch 31:12 and put all the gifts and tithes in them for safekeeping. They placed a Levite named Conaniah in charge and made his brother Shimei his assistant. 
142Ch 31:13 Ten Levites were assigned to work under them�� Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. All this was done under the authority of King Hezekiah and Azariah the High Priest. 
142Ch 31:14 Kore son of Imnah, a Levite who was chief guard at the East Gate of the Temple, was in charge of receiving the gifts offered to the LORD and of distributing them. 
142Ch 31:15 In the other cities where priests lived, he was faithfully assisted in this by other Levites�� Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the food equally to their fellow Levites according to what their duties were, 
142Ch 31:16 and not by clans. They gave a share to all males thirty years of age or older who had daily responsibilities in the Temple in accordance with their positions. 
142Ch 31:17 The priests were assigned their duties by clans, and the Levites twenty years of age or older were assigned theirs by work groups. 
142Ch 31:18 They were all registered together with their wives, children, and other dependents, because they were required to be ready to perform their sacred duties at any time. 
142Ch 31:19 Among the priests who lived in the cities assigned to Aaron's descendants or in the pasture lands belonging to these cities, there were responsible men who distributed the food to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone who was on the rolls of the Levite clans. 
142Ch 31:20 Throughout all Judah, King Hezekiah did what was right and what was pleasing to the LORD his God. 
142Ch 31:21 He was successful, because everything he did for the Temple or in observance of the Law, he did in a spirit of complete loyalty and devotion to his God. 
142Ch 32:1 After these events, in which King Hezekiah served the LORD faithfully, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities and gave orders for his army to break their way through the walls. 
142Ch 32:2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib intended to attack Jerusalem also, 
142Ch 32:3 he and his officials decided to cut off the supply of water outside the city in order to keep the Assyrians from having any water when they got near Jerusalem. 
142Ch 32:4 The officials led a large number of people out and stopped up all the springs, so that no more water flowed out of them. 
142Ch 32:5 The king strengthened the city's defenses by repairing the wall, building towers on it, and building an outer wall. In addition, he repaired the defenses built on the land that was filled in on the east side of the old part of Jerusalem. He also had a large number of spears and shields made. 
142Ch 32:6 He placed all the men in the city under the command of army officers and had them assemble in the open square at the city gate. He said to them, 
142Ch 32:7 "Be determined and confident, and don't be afraid of the Assyrian emperor or of the army he is leading. We have more power on our side than he has on his. 
142Ch 32:8 He has human power, but we have the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." The people were encouraged by these words of their king. 
142Ch 32:9 Some time later, while Sennacherib and his army were still at Lachish, he sent the following message to Hezekiah and the people of Judah who were with him in Jerusalem��
142Ch 32:10 "I, Sennacherib, Emperor of Assyria, ask what gives you people the confidence to remain in Jerusalem under siege. 
142Ch 32:11 Hezekiah tells you that the LORD your God will save you from our power, but Hezekiah is deceiving you and will let you die of hunger and thirst. 
142Ch 32:12 He is the one who destroyed the LORD's shrines and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem to worship and burn incense at one altar only. 
142Ch 32:13 Don't you know what my ancestors and I have done to the people of other nations? Did the gods of any other nation save their people from the emperor of Assyria? 
142Ch 32:14 When did any of the gods of all those countries ever save their country from us? Then what makes you think that your god can save you? 
142Ch 32:15 Now don't let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like that. Don't believe him! No god of any nation has ever been able to save his people from any Assyrian emperor. So certainly this god of yours can't save you!" 
142Ch 32:16 The Assyrian officials said even worse things about the LORD God and Hezekiah, the LORD's servant. 
142Ch 32:17 The letter that the emperor wrote defied the LORD, the God of Israel. It said, "The gods of the nations have not saved their people from my power, and neither will Hezekiah's god save his people from me." 
142Ch 32:18 The officials shouted this in Hebrew in order to frighten and discourage the people of Jerusalem who were on the city wall, so that it would be easier to capture the city. 
142Ch 32:19 They talked about the God of Jerusalem in the same way that they talked about the gods of the other peoples, idols made by human hands. 
142Ch 32:20 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed to God and cried out to him for help. 
142Ch 32:21 The LORD sent an angel that killed the soldiers and officers of the Assyrian army. So the emperor went back to Assyria disgraced. One day when he was in the temple of his god, some of his sons killed him with their swords. 
142Ch 32:22 In this way the LORD rescued King Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the power of Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, and also from their other enemies. He let the people live in peace with all the neighboring countries. 
142Ch 32:23 Many people came to Jerusalem, bringing offerings to the LORD and gifts to Hezekiah, so that from then on all the nations held Hezekiah in honor. 
142Ch 32:24 About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. He prayed, and the LORD gave him a sign that he would recover. 
142Ch 32:25 But Hezekiah was too proud to show gratitude for what the LORD had done for him, and Judah and Jerusalem suffered for it. 
142Ch 32:26 Finally, however, Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem humbled themselves, and so the LORD did not punish the people until after Hezekiah's death. 
142Ch 32:27 King Hezekiah became very wealthy, and everyone held him in honor. He had storerooms built for his gold, silver, precious stones, spices, shields, and other valuable objects. 
142Ch 32:28 In addition, he had storehouses built for his grain, wine, and olive oil; barns for his cattle; and pens for his sheep. 
142Ch 32:29 Besides all this, God gave him sheep and cattle and so much other wealth that he built many cities. 
142Ch 32:30 It was King Hezekiah who blocked the outlet for Gihon Spring and channeled the water to flow through a tunnel to a point inside the walls of Jerusalem. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did, 
142Ch 32:31 and even when the Babylonian ambassadors came to inquire about the unusual event that had happened in the land, God let Hezekiah go his own way only in order to test his character. 
142Ch 32:32 Everything else that King Hezekiah did and his devotion to the LORD are recorded in The Vision of the Prophet Isaiah Son of Amoz and in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 32:33 Hezekiah died and was buried in the upper section of the royal tombs. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem paid him great honor at his death. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. 
142Ch 33:2 Following the disgusting practices of the nations whom the LORD had driven out of the land as his people advanced, Manasseh sinned against the LORD. 
142Ch 33:3 He rebuilt the pagan places of worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He built altars for the worship of Baal, made images of the goddess Asherah, and worshiped the stars. 
142Ch 33:4 He built pagan altars in the Temple, the place that the LORD had said was where he should be worshiped forever. 
142Ch 33:5 In the two courtyards of the Temple he built altars for the worship of the stars. 
142Ch 33:6 He sacrificed his sons in Hinnom Valley as burnt offerings. He practiced divination and magic and consulted fortunetellers and mediums. He sinned greatly against the LORD and stirred up his anger. 
142Ch 33:7 He placed an image in the Temple, the place about which God had said to David and his son Solomon�� "Here in Jerusalem, in this Temple, is the place that I have chosen out of all the territory of the twelve tribes of Israel as the place where I am to be worshiped. 
142Ch 33:8 And if the people of Israel will obey all my commands and keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them, then I will not allow them to be driven out of the land that I gave to their ancestors." 
142Ch 33:9 Manasseh led the people of Judah to commit even greater sins than those committed by the nations whom the LORD had driven out of the land as his people advanced. 
142Ch 33:10 Although the LORD warned Manasseh and his people, they refused to listen. 
142Ch 33:11 So the LORD let the commanders of the Assyrian army invade Judah. They captured Manasseh, stuck hooks in him, put him in chains, and took him to Babylon. 
142Ch 33:12 In his suffering he became humble, turned to the LORD his God, and begged him for help. 
142Ch 33:13 God accepted Manasseh's prayer and answered it by letting him go back to Jerusalem and rule again. This convinced Manasseh that the LORD was God. 
142Ch 33:14 After this, Manasseh increased the height of the outer wall on the east side of David's City, from a point in the valley near Gihon Spring north to the Fish Gate and the area of the city called Ophel. He also stationed an army officer in command of a unit of troops in each of the fortified cities of Judah. 
142Ch 33:15 He removed from the Temple the foreign gods and the image that he had placed there, and the pagan altars that were on the hill where the Temple stood and in other places in Jerusalem; he took all these things outside the city and threw them away. 
142Ch 33:16 He also repaired the altar where the LORD was worshiped, and he sacrificed fellowship offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it. He commanded all the people of Judah to worship the LORD, the God of Israel. 
142Ch 33:17 Although the people continued to offer sacrifices at other places of worship, they offered them only to the LORD. 
142Ch 33:18 Everything else that Manasseh did, the prayer he made to his God, and the messages of the prophets who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.
142Ch 33:19 The king's prayer and God's answer to it, and an account of the sins he committed before he repented - the evil he did, the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah that he made and the idols that he worshiped - are all recorded in The History of the Prophets.
142Ch 33:20 Manasseh died and was buried at the palace, and his son Amon succeeded him as king. 
142Ch 33:21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for two years. 
142Ch 33:22 Like his father Manasseh, he sinned against the LORD, and he worshiped the idols that his father had worshiped. 
142Ch 33:23 But unlike his father, he did not become humble and turn to the LORD; he was even more sinful than his father had been. 
142Ch 33:24 Amon's officials plotted against him and assassinated him in the palace. 
142Ch 33:25 The people of Judah killed Amon's assassins and made his son Josiah king. 
142Ch 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for thirty-one years. 
142Ch 34:2 He did what was pleasing to the LORD; he followed the example of his ancestor King David, strictly obeying all the laws of God. 
142Ch 34:3 In the eighth year that Josiah was king, while he was still very young, he began to worship the God of his ancestor King David. Four years later he began to destroy the pagan places of worship, the symbols of the goddess Asherah, and all the other idols. 
142Ch 34:4 Under his direction the altars where Baal was worshiped were smashed, and the incense altars near them were torn down. They ground to dust the images of Asherah and all the other idols and then scattered the dust on the graves of the people who had sacrificed to them. 
142Ch 34:5 He burned the bones of the pagan priests on the altars where they had worshiped. By doing all this, he made Judah and Jerusalem ritually clean again. 
142Ch 34:6 He did the same thing in the cities and the devastated areas of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far north as Naphtali. 
142Ch 34:7 Throughout the territory of the Northern Kingdom he smashed the altars and the symbols of Asherah, ground the idols to dust, and broke into bits all the incense altars. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 34:8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple by ending pagan worship, King Josiah sent three men to repair the Temple of the LORD God�� Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah, the governor of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, a high official. 
142Ch 34:9 The money that the Levite guards had collected in the Temple was turned over to Hilkiah the High Priest. (It had been collected from the people of Ephraim and Manasseh and the rest of the Northern Kingdom, and from the people of Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem.) 
142Ch 34:10 This money was then handed over to the three men in charge of the Temple repairs, and they gave it to 
142Ch 34:11 the carpenters and the builders to buy the stones and the timber used to repair the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to decay. 
142Ch 34:12 The men who did the work were thoroughly honest. They were supervised by four Levites�� Jahath and Obadiah of the clan of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam of the clan of Kohath. (The Levites were all skillful musicians.) 
142Ch 34:13 Other Levites were in charge of transporting materials and supervising the workers on various jobs, and others kept records or served as guards. 
142Ch 34:14 While the money was being taken out of the storeroom, Hilkiah found the book of the Law of the LORD, the Law that God had given to Moses. 
142Ch 34:15 He said to Shaphan, "I have found the book of the Law here in the Temple." He gave Shaphan the book, 
142Ch 34:16 and Shaphan took it to the king. He reported, "We have done everything that you commanded. 
142Ch 34:17 We have taken the money that was kept in the Temple and handed it over to the workers and their supervisors." 
142Ch 34:18 Then he added, "I have here a book that Hilkiah gave me." And he read it aloud to the king. 
142Ch 34:19 When the king heard the book being read, he tore his clothes in dismay 
142Ch 34:20 and gave the following order to Hilkiah, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, to Abdon son of Micaiah, to Shaphan, the court secretary, and to Asaiah, the king's attendant��
142Ch 34:21 "Go and consult the LORD for me and for the people who still remain in Israel and Judah. Find out about the teachings of this book. The LORD is angry with us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the LORD and have not done what this book says must be done." 
142Ch 34:22 At the king's command, Hilkiah and the others went to consult a woman named Huldah, a prophet who lived in the newer part of Jerusalem. (Her husband Shallum, the son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas, was in charge of the Temple robes.) They described to her what had happened, 
142Ch 34:23 and she told them to go back to the king and give him 
142Ch 34:24 the following message from the LORD�� "I am going to punish Jerusalem and all its people with the curses written in the book that was read to the king. 
142Ch 34:25 They have rejected me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and so have stirred up my anger by all they have done. My anger is aroused against Jerusalem, and it will not die down. 
142Ch 34:26 As for the king himself, this is what I, the LORD God of Israel, say�� You listened to what is written in the book, 
142Ch 34:27 and you repented and humbled yourself before me, tearing your clothes and weeping, when you heard how I threatened to punish Jerusalem and its people. I have heard your prayer, 
142Ch 34:28 and the punishment which I am going to bring on Jerusalem will not come until after your death. I will let you die in peace." The men returned to King Josiah with this message. 
142Ch 34:29 King Josiah summoned all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, 
142Ch 34:30 and together they went to the Temple, accompanied by the priests and the Levites and all the rest of the people, rich and poor alike. Before them all the king read aloud the whole book of the covenant, which had been found in the Temple. 
142Ch 34:31 He stood by the royal column and made a covenant with the LORD to obey him, to keep his laws and commands with all his heart and soul, and to put into practice the demands attached to the covenant, as written in the book. 
142Ch 34:32 He made the people of Benjamin and everyone else present in Jerusalem promise to keep the covenant. And so the people of Jerusalem obeyed the requirements of the covenant they had made with the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 34:33 King Josiah destroyed all the disgusting idols that were in the territory belonging to the people of Israel, and as long as he lived, he required the people to serve the LORD, the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 35:1 King Josiah celebrated the Passover at Jerusalem in honor of the LORD; on the fourteenth day of the first month they killed the animals for the festival. 
142Ch 35:2 He assigned to the priests the duties they were to perform in the Temple and encouraged them to do them well. 
142Ch 35:3 He also gave these instructions to the Levites, the teachers of Israel, who were dedicated to the LORD�� "Put the sacred Covenant Box in the Temple that King Solomon, the son of David, built. You are no longer to carry it from place to place, but you are to serve the LORD your God and his people Israel. 
142Ch 35:4 Take your places in the Temple by clans, according to the responsibilities assigned to you by King David and his son King Solomon, 
142Ch 35:5 and arrange yourselves so that some of you will be available to help each family of the people of Israel. 
142Ch 35:6 You are to kill the Passover lambs and goats. Now make yourselves ritually clean and prepare the sacrifices in order that your fellow Israelites may follow the instructions which the LORD gave through Moses." 
142Ch 35:7 For the use of the people at the Passover, King Josiah contributed from his own herds and flocks 30,000 sheep, lambs, and young goats, and 3,000 bulls. 
142Ch 35:8 His officials also made contributions for the people, the priests, and the Levites to use. And the officials in charge of the Temple - Hilkiah, the High Priest, Zechariah, and Jehiel - gave the priests 2,600 lambs and young goats and 300 bulls for sacrifices during the festival. 
142Ch 35:9 The leaders of the Levites - Conaniah, Shemaiah and his brother Nethanel, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad - contributed 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls for the Levites to offer as sacrifices. 
142Ch 35:10 When everything was arranged for the Passover, the priests and the Levites took their posts, as commanded by the king. 
142Ch 35:11 After the lambs and goats had been killed, the Levites skinned them, and the priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
142Ch 35:12 Then they divided among the people, by family groups, the animals for burnt offerings, so that they could offer them according to the instructions in the Law of Moses. 
142Ch 35:13 The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire, according to the regulations, and boiled the sacred offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and quickly distributed the meat to the people. 
142Ch 35:14 After this was done, the Levites provided meat for themselves and for the priests descended from Aaron, for the priests were kept busy until night, burning the animals that were burned whole and the fat of the sacrifices. 
142Ch 35:15 The following musicians of the Levite clan of Asaph were in the places assigned to them by King David's instructions�� Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's prophet. The guards at the Temple gates did not need to leave their posts, because the other Levites prepared the Passover for them. 
142Ch 35:16 So, as King Josiah had commanded, everything was done that day for the worship of the LORD, the keeping of the Passover Festival, and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar. 
142Ch 35:17 For seven days all the people of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 
142Ch 35:18 Since the days of the prophet Samuel, the Passover had never been celebrated like this. None of the former kings had ever celebrated a Passover like this one celebrated by King Josiah, the priests, the Levites, and the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem 
142Ch 35:19 in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign. 
142Ch 35:20 After King Josiah had done all this for the Temple, King Neco of Egypt led an army to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates River. Josiah tried to stop him, 
142Ch 35:21 but Neco sent Josiah this message�� "This war I am fighting does not concern you, King of Judah. I have not come to fight you, but to fight my enemies, and God has told me to hurry. God is on my side, so don't oppose me, or he will destroy you." 
142Ch 35:22 But Josiah was determined to fight. He refused to listen to what God was saying through King Neco, so he disguised himself and went into battle on the plain of Megiddo. 
142Ch 35:23 During the battle King Josiah was struck by Egyptian arrows. He ordered his servants, "Take me away; I'm badly hurt!" 
142Ch 35:24 They lifted him out of his chariot, placed him in a second chariot which he had there, and took him to Jerusalem. There he died and was buried in the royal tombs. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned his death. 
142Ch 35:25 The prophet Jeremiah composed a lament for King Josiah. It has become a custom in Israel for the singers, both men and women, to use this song when they mourn for him. The song is found in the collection of laments. 
142Ch 35:26 Everything that Josiah did - his devotion to the LORD, his obedience to the Law, 
142Ch 35:27 and his history from beginning to end - is all recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 36:1 The people of Judah chose Josiah's son Joahaz and anointed him king in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 36:2 Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months. 
142Ch 36:3 King Neco of Egypt took him prisoner and made Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold as tribute. 
142Ch 36:4 Neco made Joahaz' brother Eliakim king of Judah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Joahaz was taken to Egypt by Neco. 
142Ch 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. He sinned against the LORD his God. 
142Ch 36:6 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded Judah, captured Jehoiakim, and took him to Babylonia in chains. 
142Ch 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar carried off some of the treasures of the Temple and put them in his palace in Babylon. 
142Ch 36:8 Everything that Jehoiakim did, including his disgusting practices and the evil he committed, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah.His son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king.
142Ch 36:9 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for three months and ten days. He too sinned against the LORD. 
142Ch 36:10 When spring came, King Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylonia as a prisoner and carried off the treasures of the Temple. Then Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin's uncle Zedekiah king of Judah and Jerusalem. 
142Ch 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. 
142Ch 36:12 He sinned against the LORD and did not listen humbly to the prophet Jeremiah, who spoke the word of the LORD. 
142Ch 36:13 Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had forced him to swear in God's name that he would be loyal. He stubbornly refused to repent and return to the LORD, the God of Israel. 
142Ch 36:14 In addition, the leaders of Judah, the priests, and the people followed the sinful example of the nations around them in worshiping idols, and so they defiled the Temple, which the LORD himself had made holy. 
142Ch 36:15 The LORD, the God of their ancestors, had continued to send prophets to warn his people, because he wanted to spare them and the Temple. 
142Ch 36:16 But they made fun of God's messengers, ignoring his words and laughing at his prophets, until at last the LORD's anger against his people was so great that there was no escape. 
142Ch 36:17 So the LORD brought the king of Babylonia to attack them. The king killed the young men of Judah even in the Temple. He had no mercy on anyone, young or old, man or woman, sick or healthy. God handed them all over to him. 
142Ch 36:18 The king of Babylonia looted the Temple, the Temple treasury, and the wealth of the king and his officials, and took everything back to Babylon. 
142Ch 36:19 He burned down the Temple and the city, with all its palaces and its wealth, and broke down the city wall. 
142Ch 36:20 He took all the survivors to Babylonia, where they served him and his descendants as slaves until the rise of the Persian Empire. 
142Ch 36:21 And so what the LORD had foretold through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled�� "The land will lie desolate for seventy years, to make up for the Sabbath rest that has not been observed." 
142Ch 36:22 In the first year that Cyrus of Persia was emperor, the LORD made what he had said through the prophet Jeremiah come true. He prompted Cyrus to issue the following command and send it out in writing to be read aloud everywhere in his empire��
142Ch 36:23 "This is the command of Cyrus, Emperor of Persia. The LORD, the God of Heaven, has made me ruler over the whole world and has given me the responsibility of building a temple for him in Jerusalem in Judah. Now, all of you who are God's people, go there, and may the LORD your God be with you."

15Ezr 1:1 In the first year that Cyrus of Persia was emperor, the LORD made what he had said through the prophet Jeremiah come true. He prompted Cyrus to issue the following command and send it out in writing to be read aloud everywhere in his empire��
15Ezr 1:2 "This is the command of Cyrus, Emperor of Persia. The LORD, the God of Heaven, has made me ruler over the whole world and has given me the responsibility of building a temple for him in Jerusalem in Judah. 
15Ezr 1:3 May God be with all of you who are his people. You are to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is worshiped in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 1:4 If any of his people in exile need help to return, their neighbors are to give them this help. They are to provide them with silver and gold, supplies and pack animals, as well as offerings to present in the Temple of God in Jerusalem." 
15Ezr 1:5 Then the heads of the clans of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the priests and Levites, and everyone else whose heart God had moved got ready to go and rebuild the LORD's Temple in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 1:6 All their neighbors helped them by giving them many things�� silver utensils, gold, supplies, pack animals, other valuables, and offerings for the Temple. 
15Ezr 1:7 Emperor Cyrus gave them back the bowls and cups that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had put in the temple of his gods. 
15Ezr 1:8 He handed them over to Mithredath, chief of the royal treasury, who made an inventory of them for Sheshbazzar, the governor of Judah, 
15Ezr 1:9 as follows���� gold bowls for offerings - 30�� silver bowls for offerings - 1,000�� other bowls - 29�� small gold bowls - 30��
15Ezr 1:10 small silver bowls - 410�� other utensils - 1,000 
15Ezr 1:11 In all there were 5,400 gold and silver bowls and other articles which Sheshbazzar took with him when he and the other exiles went from Babylon to Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 2:1 Many of the exiles left the province of Babylon and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, all to their own hometowns. Their families had been living in exile in Babylonia ever since King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them there as prisoners. 
15Ezr 2:2 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. This is the list of the clans of Israel, with the number of those from each clan who returned from exile��

15Ezr 2:56 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, 
15Ezr 2:57 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth Hazzebaim, and Ami.
15Ezr 2:58 The total number of descendants of the Temple workers and of Solomon's servants who returned from exile was 392. 
15Ezr 2:59 There were 652 belonging to the clans of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda who returned from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; 
15Ezr 2:60 but they could not prove that they were descendants of Israelites. 
15Ezr 2:61 The following priestly clans could find no record to prove their ancestry�� Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (The ancestor of the priestly clan of Barzillai had married a woman from the clan of Barzillai of Gilead and had taken the name of his father-in-law's clan.)
15Ezr 2:62 Since they were unable to prove who their ancestors were, they were not accepted as priests. 
15Ezr 2:63 The Jewish governor told them that they could not eat the food offered to God until there was a priest who could use the Urim and Thummim. 
15Ezr 2:64 Total number of exiles who returned - 42,360�� 
15Ezr 2:65 Their male and female servants - 7,337, Male and female musicians - 200,
15Ezr 2:66 Horses - 736, Mules - 245,
15Ezr 2:67 Camels - 435, Donkeys - 6,720.
15Ezr 2:68 When the exiles arrived at the LORD's Temple in Jerusalem, some of the leaders of the clans gave freewill offerings to help rebuild the Temple on its old site. 
15Ezr 2:69 They gave as much as they could for this work, and the total came to 1,030 pounds of gold, 5,740 pounds of silver, and 100 robes for priests. 
15Ezr 2:70 The priests, the Levites, and some of the people settled in or near Jerusalem; the musicians, the Temple guards, and the Temple workers settled in nearby towns; and the rest of the Israelites settled in the towns where their ancestors had lived. 
15Ezr 3:1 By the seventh month the people of Israel were all settled in their towns. Then they all assembled in Jerusalem, 
15Ezr 3:2 and Joshua son of Jehozadak, his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, together with his relatives, rebuilt the altar of the God of Israel, so that they could burn sacrifices on it according to the instructions written in the Law of Moses, the man of God. 
15Ezr 3:3 Even though the returning exiles were afraid of the people who were living in the land, they rebuilt the altar where it had stood before. Then they began once again to burn on it the regular morning and evening sacrifices. 
15Ezr 3:4 They celebrated the Festival of Shelters according to the regulations; each day they offered the sacrifices required for that day; 
15Ezr 3:5 and in addition they offered the regular sacrifices to be burned whole and those to be offered at the New Moon Festival and at all the other regular assemblies at which the LORD is worshiped, as well as all the offerings that were given to the LORD voluntarily. 
15Ezr 3:6 Although the people had not yet started to rebuild the Temple, they began on the first day of the seventh month to burn sacrifices to the LORD. 
15Ezr 3:7 The people gave money to pay the stonemasons and the carpenters and gave food, drink, and olive oil to be sent to the cities of Tyre and Sidon in exchange for cedar trees from Lebanon, which were to be brought by sea to Joppa. All this was done with the permission of Emperor Cyrus of Persia. 
15Ezr 3:8 So in the second month of the year after they came back to the site of the Temple in Jerusalem, they began work. Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the rest of their people, the priests, and the Levites, in fact all the exiles who had come back to Jerusalem, joined in the work. All the Levites twenty years of age or older were put in charge of the work of rebuilding the Temple. 
15Ezr 3:9 The Levite Jeshua and his sons and relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons (the clan of Hodaviah ) joined together in taking charge of the rebuilding of the Temple. (They were helped by the Levites of the clan of Henadad.) 
15Ezr 3:10 When the builders started to lay the foundation of the Temple, the priests in their robes took their places with trumpets in their hands, and the Levites of the clan of Asaph stood there with cymbals. They praised the LORD according to the instructions handed down from the time of King David. 
15Ezr 3:11 They sang the LORD's praises, repeating the refrain�� "The LORD is good, and his love for Israel is eternal." Everyone shouted with all their might, praising the LORD, because the work on the foundation of the Temple had been started. 
15Ezr 3:12 Many of the older priests, Levites, and heads of clans had seen the first Temple, and as they watched the foundation of this Temple being laid, they cried and wailed. But the others who were there shouted for joy. 
15Ezr 3:13 No one could distinguish between the joyful shouts and the crying, because the noise they made was so loud that it could be heard for miles. 
15Ezr 4:1 The enemies of the people of Judah and Benjamin heard that those who had returned from exile were rebuilding the Temple of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
15Ezr 4:2 So they went to see Zerubbabel and the heads of the clans and said, "Let us join you in building the Temple. We worship the same God you worship, and we have been offering sacrifices to him ever since Emperor Esarhaddon of Assyria sent us here to live." 
15Ezr 4:3 Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the heads of the clans told them, "We don't need your help to build a temple for the LORD our God. We will build it ourselves, just as Emperor Cyrus of Persia commanded us." 
15Ezr 4:4 Then the people who had been living in the land tried to discourage and frighten the Jews and keep them from building. 
15Ezr 4:5 They also bribed Persian government officials to work against them. They kept on doing this throughout the reign of Emperor Cyrus and into the reign of Emperor Darius. 
15Ezr 4:6 At the beginning of the reign of Emperor Xerxes, the enemies of the people living in Judah and Jerusalem brought written charges against them. 
15Ezr 4:7 Again in the reign of Emperor Artaxerxes of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote a letter to the emperor. The letter was written in Aramaic and was to be translated when read. 
15Ezr 4:8 Also Rehum, the governor, and Shimshai, the secretary of the province, wrote the following letter to Emperor Artaxerxes about Jerusalem��
15Ezr 4:9 "From Rehum, the governor, from Shimshai, secretary of the province, from their associates, the judges, and from all the other officials, who are originally from Erech, Babylon, and Susa in the land of Elam, 
15Ezr 4:10 together with the other peoples whom the great and powerful Ashurbanipal moved from their homes and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in West-of-Euphrates Province." 
15Ezr 4:11 This is the text of the letter�� "To Emperor Artaxerxes from his servants who live in West-of-Euphrates. 
15Ezr 4:12 "We want Your Majesty to know that the Jews who came here from your other territories have settled in Jerusalem and are rebuilding that evil and rebellious city. They have begun to rebuild the walls and will soon finish them. 
15Ezr 4:13 Your Majesty, if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the people will stop paying taxes, and your royal revenues will decrease. 
15Ezr 4:14 Now, because we are under obligation to Your Majesty, we do not want to see this happen, and so we suggest 
15Ezr 4:15 that you order a search to be made in the records your ancestors kept. If you do, you will discover that this city has always been rebellious and that from ancient times it has given trouble to kings and to rulers of provinces. Its people have always been hard to govern. This is why the city was destroyed. 
15Ezr 4:16 We therefore are convinced that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, Your Majesty will no longer be able to control West-of-Euphrates Province." 
15Ezr 4:17 The emperor sent this answer�� "To Rehum, the governor, to Shimshai, secretary of the province, and to their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of West-of-Euphrates, greetings. 
15Ezr 4:18 "The letter which you sent has been translated and read to me. 
15Ezr 4:19 I gave orders for an investigation to be made, and it has indeed been found that from ancient times Jerusalem has revolted against royal authority and that it has been full of rebels and troublemakers. 
15Ezr 4:20 Powerful kings have reigned there and have ruled over the entire province of West-of-Euphrates, collecting taxes and revenue. 
15Ezr 4:21 Therefore you are to issue orders that those men are to stop rebuilding the city until I give further commands. 
15Ezr 4:22 Do this at once, so that no more harm may be done to my interests." 
15Ezr 4:23 As soon as this letter from Emperor Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their associates, they hurried to Jerusalem and forced the Jews to stop rebuilding the city. 
15Ezr 4:24 Work on the Temple had been stopped and had remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of Emperor Darius of Persia. 
15Ezr 5:1 At that time two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo, began to speak in the name of the God of Israel to the Jews who lived in Judah and Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 5:2 When Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak heard their messages, they began to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, and the two prophets helped them. 
15Ezr 5:3 Almost at once Governor Tattenai of West-of-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and their fellow officials came to Jerusalem and demanded�� "Who gave you orders to build this Temple and equip it?" 
15Ezr 5:4 They also asked for the names of all the men who were helping build the Temple. 
15Ezr 5:5 But God was watching over the Jewish leaders, and the Persian officials decided to take no action until they could write to Emperor Darius and receive a reply. 
15Ezr 5:6 This is the report that they sent to the emperor��
15Ezr 5:7 "To Emperor Darius, may you rule in peace. 
15Ezr 5:8 "Your Majesty should know that we went to the province of Judah and found that the Temple of the great God is being rebuilt with large stone blocks and with wooden beams set in the wall. The work is being done with great care and is moving ahead steadily. 
15Ezr 5:9 "We then asked the leaders of the people to tell us who had given them authority to rebuild the Temple and to equip it. 
15Ezr 5:10 We also asked them their names so that we could inform you who the leaders of this work are. 
15Ezr 5:11 "They answered, 'We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple which was originally built and equipped many years ago by a powerful king of Israel. 
15Ezr 5:12 But because our ancestors made the God of Heaven angry, he let them be conquered by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, a king of the Chaldean dynasty. The Temple was destroyed, and the people were taken into exile in Babylonia. 
15Ezr 5:13 Then in the first year of the reign of King Cyrus as emperor of Babylonia, Cyrus issued orders for the Temple to be rebuilt. 
15Ezr 5:14 He restored the gold and silver Temple utensils which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple in Babylon. Emperor Cyrus turned these utensils over to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor of Judah. 
15Ezr 5:15 The emperor told him to take them and return them to the Temple in Jerusalem, and to rebuild the Temple where it had stood before. 
15Ezr 5:16 So Sheshbazzar came and laid its foundation; construction has continued from then until the present, but it is still not finished.' 
15Ezr 5:17 "Now, if it please Your Majesty, have a search made in the royal records in Babylon to find whether or not Emperor Cyrus gave orders for this Temple in Jerusalem to be rebuilt, and then inform us what your will is in this matter." 
15Ezr 6:1 So Emperor Darius issued orders for a search to be made in the royal records that were kept in Babylon. 
15Ezr 6:2 But it was in the city of Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found, containing the following record��
15Ezr 6:3 "In the first year of his reign Emperor Cyrus commanded that the Temple in Jerusalem be rebuilt as a place where sacrifices are made and offerings are burned. The Temple is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide. 
15Ezr 6:4 The walls are to be built with one layer of wood on top of each three layers of stone. All expenses are to be paid by the royal treasury. 
15Ezr 6:5 Also the gold and silver utensils which King Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon from the Temple in Jerusalem are to be returned to their proper place in the Jerusalem Temple." 
15Ezr 6:6 Then Emperor Darius sent the following reply�� "To Tattenai, governor of West-of-Euphrates, Shethar Bozenai, and your fellow officials in West-of-Euphrates. "Stay away from the Temple 
15Ezr 6:7 and do not interfere with its construction. Let the governor of Judah and the Jewish leaders rebuild the Temple of God where it stood before. 
15Ezr 6:8 I hereby command you to help them rebuild it. Their expenses are to be paid promptly out of the royal funds received from taxes in West-of-Euphrates, so that the work is not interrupted. 
15Ezr 6:9 Day by day, without fail, you are to give the priests in Jerusalem whatever they tell you they need�� young bulls, sheep, or lambs to be burned as offerings to the God of Heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, or olive oil. 
15Ezr 6:10 This is to be done so that they can offer sacrifices that are acceptable to the God of Heaven and pray for his blessing on me and my sons. 
15Ezr 6:11 I further command that if any disobey this order, a wooden beam is to be torn out of their houses, sharpened on one end, and then driven through their bodies. And their houses are to be made a rubbish heap. 
15Ezr 6:12 May the God who chose Jerusalem as the place where he is to be worshiped overthrow any king or nation that defies this command and tries to destroy the Temple there. I, Darius, have commanded. My command is to be fully obeyed." 
15Ezr 6:13 Then Governor Tattenai, Shethar Bozenai, and their fellow officials did exactly as the emperor had commanded. 
15Ezr 6:14 The Jewish leaders made good progress with the building of the Temple, encouraged by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. They completed the Temple as they had been commanded by the God of Israel and by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, emperors of Persia. 
15Ezr 6:15 They finished the Temple on the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Darius. 
15Ezr 6:16 Then the people of Israel - the priests, the Levites, and all the others who had returned from exile - joyfully dedicated the Temple. 
15Ezr 6:17 For the dedication they offered 100 bulls, 200 sheep, and 400 lambs as sacrifices, and 12 goats as offerings for sin, one for each tribe of Israel. 
15Ezr 6:18 They also organized the priests and the Levites for the Temple services in Jerusalem, according to the instructions contained in the book of Moses. 
15Ezr 6:19 The people who had returned from exile celebrated Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month of the following year. 
15Ezr 6:20 All the priests and the Levites had purified themselves and were ritually clean. The Levites killed the animals for the Passover sacrifices for all the people who had returned, for the priests, and for themselves. 
15Ezr 6:21 The sacrifices were eaten by all the Israelites who had returned from exile and by all those who had given up the pagan ways of the other people who were living in the land and who had come to worship the LORD God of Israel. 
15Ezr 6:22 For seven days they joyfully celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread. They were full of joy because the LORD had made the emperor of Assyria favorable to them, so that he supported them in their work of rebuilding the Temple of the God of Israel. 
15Ezr 7:1 Many years later, when Artaxerxes was emperor of Persia, there was a man named Ezra. He traced his ancestors back to Aaron, the High Priest, as follows�� Ezra was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
15Ezr 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
15Ezr 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
15Ezr 7:4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
15Ezr 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron. 
15Ezr 7:6 Ezra was a scholar with a thorough knowledge of the Law which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given to Moses. Because Ezra had the blessing of the LORD his God, the emperor gave him everything he asked for. 
15Ezr 7:7 In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, Ezra set out from Babylonia for Jerusalem with a group of Israelites which included priests, Levites, Temple musicians, Temple guards, and workers. 
15Ezr 7:8 They left Babylonia on the first day of the first month, 
15Ezr 7:9 and with God's help they arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. 
15Ezr 7:10 Ezra had devoted his life to studying the Law of the LORD, to practicing it, and to teaching all its laws and regulations to the people of Israel. 
15Ezr 7:11 Emperor Artaxerxes gave the following document to Ezra, the priest and scholar, who had a thorough knowledge of the laws and commands which the LORD had given to Israel��
15Ezr 7:12 "From Emperor Artaxerxes to the priest Ezra, scholar in the Law of the God of Heaven. 
15Ezr 7:13 "I command that throughout my empire all the Israelite people, priests, and Levites that so desire be permitted to go with you to Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 7:14 I, together with my seven counselors, send you to investigate the conditions in Jerusalem and Judah in order to see how well the Law of your God, which has been entrusted to you, is being obeyed. 
15Ezr 7:15 You are to take with you the gold and silver offerings which I and my counselors desire to give to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 7:16 You are also to take all the silver and gold which you collect throughout the province of Babylon and the offerings which the Israelite people and their priests give for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 7:17 "You are to spend this money carefully and buy bulls, rams, lambs, grain, and wine and offer them on the altar of the Temple in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 7:18 You may use the silver and gold that is left over for whatever you and your people desire, in accordance with the will of your God. 
15Ezr 7:19 You are to present to God in Jerusalem all the utensils that have been given to you for use in the Temple services. 
15Ezr 7:20 And anything else which you need for the Temple, you may get from the royal treasury. 
15Ezr 7:21 "I command all the treasury officials in West-of-Euphrates Province to provide promptly for Ezra, the priest and scholar in the Law of the God of Heaven, everything he asks you for, 
15Ezr 7:22 up to a limit of 7,500 pounds of silver, 500 bushels of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, 550 gallons of olive oil, and as much salt as needed. 
15Ezr 7:23 You must be careful to provide everything which the God of Heaven requires for his Temple, and so make sure that he is never angry with me or with those who reign after me. 
15Ezr 7:24 You are forbidden to collect any taxes from the priests, Levites, musicians, guards, workers, or anyone else connected with this Temple. 
15Ezr 7:25 "You, Ezra, using the wisdom which your God has given you, are to appoint administrators and judges to govern all the people in West-of-Euphrates who live by the Law of your God. You must teach that Law to anyone who does not know it. 
15Ezr 7:26 If any disobey the laws of your God or the laws of the empire, they are to be punished promptly�� by death or by exile or by confiscation of their property or by imprisonment." 
15Ezr 7:27 Ezra said, "Praise the LORD, the God of our ancestors! He has made the emperor willing to honor in this way the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 7:28 By God's grace I have won the favor of the emperor, of his counselors, and of all his powerful officials; the LORD my God has given me courage, and I have been able to persuade many of the heads of the clans of Israel to return with me." 
15Ezr 8:1 This is the list of the heads of the clans who had been in exile in Babylonia and who returned with Ezra to Jerusalem when Artaxerxes was emperor��
15Ezr 8:2 Gershom, of the clan of Phinehas; Daniel, of the clan of Ithamar; Hattush son of Shecaniah, of the clan of David;
15Ezr 8:3 Zechariah, of the clan of Parosh, with 150 men of his clan (there were records of their family lines); 
15Ezr 8:4 Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, of the clan of Pahath Moab, with 200 men;
15Ezr 8:5 Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, of the clan of Zattu, with 300 men; 
15Ezr 8:6 Ebed son of Jonathan, of the clan of Adin, with 50 men; 
15Ezr 8:7 Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, of the clan of Elam, with 70 men; 
15Ezr 8:8 Zebadiah son of Michael, of the clan of Shephatiah, with 80 men;
15Ezr 8:9 Obadiah son of Jehiel, of the clan of Joab, with 218 men;
15Ezr 8:10 Shelomith son of Josiphiah, of the clan of Bani, with 160 men;
15Ezr 8:11 Zechariah son of Bebai, of the clan of Bebai, with 28 men;
15Ezr 8:12 Johanan son of Hakkatan, of the clan of Azgad, with 110 men;
15Ezr 8:13 Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, of the clan of Adonikam, with 60 men (they returned at a later date);
15Ezr 8:14 Uthai and Zaccur, of the clan of Bigvai, with 70 men.
15Ezr 8:15 I assembled the entire group by the canal that runs to the town of Ahava, and we camped there three days. I found that there were priests in the group, but no Levites. 
15Ezr 8:16 I sent for nine of the leaders�� Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, and for two teachers, Joiarib and Elnathan. 
15Ezr 8:17 I sent them to Iddo, head of the community at Casiphia, to ask him and his associates, the Temple workers, to send us people to serve God in the Temple. 
15Ezr 8:18 Through God's grace they sent us Sherebiah, an able man, a Levite from the clan of Mahli; and eighteen of his sons and brothers came with him. 
15Ezr 8:19 They also sent Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the clan of Merari, with twenty of their relatives. 
15Ezr 8:20 In addition there were 220 Temple workers whose ancestors had been designated by King David and his officials to assist the Levites. They were all listed by name. 
15Ezr 8:21 There by the Ahava Canal I gave orders for us all to fast and humble ourselves before our God and to ask him to lead us on our journey and protect us and our children and all our possessions. 
15Ezr 8:22 I would have been ashamed to ask the emperor for a troop of cavalry to guard us from any enemies during our journey, because I had told him that our God blesses everyone who trusts him, but that he is displeased with and punishes anyone who turns away from him. 
15Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and prayed for God to protect us, and he answered our prayers. 
15Ezr 8:24 From among the leading priests I chose Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten others. 
15Ezr 8:25 Then I weighed out the silver, the gold, and the utensils which the emperor, his advisers and officials, and the people of Israel had given to be used in the Temple, and I gave it to the priests. 
15Ezr 8:26 This is what I gave them�� silver - 25 tons, 100 silver utensils - 150 pounds, gold - 7,500 pounds, 
15Ezr 8:27 20 gold bowls - 270 ounces, fine bronze bowls, equal in value to gold bowls. 
15Ezr 8:28 I said to them, "You are sacred to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and so are all the silver and gold utensils brought to him as freewill offerings. 
15Ezr 8:29 Guard them carefully until you reach the Temple. There in the priests' rooms weigh them and turn them over to the leaders of the priests and of the Levites, and to the leaders of the people of Israel in Jerusalem." 
15Ezr 8:30 So the priests and the Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the utensils, to take them to the Temple in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 8:31 It was on the twelfth day of the first month that we left the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. Our God was with us and protected us from enemy attacks and from ambush as we traveled. 
15Ezr 8:32 When we reached Jerusalem, we rested three days. 
15Ezr 8:33 Then on the fourth day we went to the Temple, weighed the silver, the gold, and the utensils, and turned them over to Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah. With him were Eleazar son of Phinehas and two Levites, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
15Ezr 8:34 Everything was counted and weighed, and a complete record was made at the same time. 
15Ezr 8:35 All those who had returned from exile then brought offerings to be burned as sacrifices to the God of Israel. They offered 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs; they also offered 12 goats to purify themselves from sin. All these animals were burned as sacrifices to the LORD. 
15Ezr 8:36 They also took the document the emperor had given them and gave it to the governors and officials of West-of-Euphrates Province, who then gave their support to the people and the Temple worship. 
15Ezr 9:1 After all this had been done, some of the leaders of the people of Israel came and told me that the people, the priests, and the Levites had not kept themselves separate from the people in the neighboring countries of Ammon, Moab, and Egypt or from the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Amorites. They were doing the same disgusting things which these people did. 
15Ezr 9:2 Jewish men were marrying foreign women, and so God's holy people had become contaminated. The leaders and officials were the chief offenders. 
15Ezr 9:3 When I heard this, I tore my clothes in despair, tore my hair and my beard, and sat down crushed with grief. 
15Ezr 9:4 I sat there grieving until the time for the evening sacrifice to be offered, and people began to gather around me - all those who were frightened because of what the God of Israel had said about the sins of those who had returned from exile. 
15Ezr 9:5 When the time came for the evening sacrifice, I got up from where I had been grieving, and still wearing my torn clothes, I knelt in prayer and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God. 
15Ezr 9:6 I said, "O God, I am too ashamed to raise my head in your presence. Our sins pile up higher than our heads; they reach as high as the heavens. 
15Ezr 9:7 From the days of our ancestors until now, we, your people, have sinned greatly. Because of our sins we, our kings, and our priests have fallen into the hands of foreign kings, and we have been slaughtered, robbed, and carried away as prisoners. We have been totally disgraced, as we still are today. 
15Ezr 9:8 Now for a short time, O LORD our God, you have been gracious to us and have let some of us escape from slavery and live in safety in this holy place. You have let us escape from slavery and have given us new life. 
15Ezr 9:9 We were slaves, but you did not leave us in slavery. You made the emperors of Persia favor us and permit us to go on living and to rebuild your Temple, which was in ruins, and to find safety here in Judah and Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 9:10 "But now, O God, what can we say after all that has happened? We have again disobeyed the commands 
15Ezr 9:11 that you gave us through your servants, the prophets. They told us that the land we were going to occupy was an impure land because the people who lived in it filled it from one end to the other with disgusting, filthy actions. 
15Ezr 9:12 They told us that we were never to intermarry with those people and never to help them prosper or succeed if we wanted to enjoy the land and pass it on to our descendants forever. 
15Ezr 9:13 Even after everything that has happened to us in punishment for our sins and wrongs, we know that you, our God, have punished us less than we deserve and have allowed us to survive. 
15Ezr 9:14 Then how can we ignore your commandments again and intermarry with these wicked people? If we do, you will be so angry that you will destroy us completely and let no one survive. 
15Ezr 9:15 LORD God of Israel, you are just, but you have let us survive. We confess our guilt to you; we have no right to come into your presence." 
15Ezr 10:1 While Ezra was bowing in prayer in front of the Temple, weeping and confessing these sins, a large group of Israelites - men, women, and children - gathered around him, weeping bitterly. 
15Ezr 10:2 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the clan of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have broken faith with God by marrying foreign women, but even so there is still hope for Israel. 
15Ezr 10:3 Now we must make a solemn promise to our God that we will send these women and their children away. We will do what you and the others who honor God's commands advise us to do. We will do what God's Law demands. 
15Ezr 10:4 It is your responsibility to act. We are behind you, so go ahead and get it done." 
15Ezr 10:5 So Ezra began by making the leaders of the priests, of the Levites, and of the rest of the people take an oath that they would do what Shecaniah had proposed. 
15Ezr 10:6 Then he went from in front of the Temple into the living quarters of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, and spent the night there grieving over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. He did not eat or drink anything. 
15Ezr 10:7 A message was sent throughout Jerusalem and Judah that all those who had returned from exile were to meet in Jerusalem 
15Ezr 10:8 by order of the leaders of the people. If any failed to come within three days, all their property would be confiscated, and they would lose their right to be members of the community. 
15Ezr 10:9 Within the three days, on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the men living in the territory of Judah and Benjamin came to Jerusalem and assembled in the Temple square. It was raining hard, and because of the weather and the importance of the meeting everyone was trembling. 
15Ezr 10:10 Ezra the priest stood up and spoke to them. He said, "You have been faithless and have brought guilt on Israel by marrying foreign women. 
15Ezr 10:11 Now then, confess your sins to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do what pleases him. Separate yourselves from the foreigners living in our land and get rid of your foreign wives." 
15Ezr 10:12 The people shouted in answer, "We will do whatever you say." 
15Ezr 10:13 But they added, "The crowd is too big, and it's raining hard. We can't stand here in the open like this. This isn't something that can be done in one or two days, because so many of us are involved in this sin. 
15Ezr 10:14 Let our officials stay in Jerusalem and take charge of the matter. Then let anyone who has a foreign wife come at a set time, together with the leaders and the judges of his city. In this way God's anger over this situation will be turned away." 
15Ezr 10:15 No one was opposed to the plan except Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, who had the support of Meshullam and of Shabbethai, a Levite. 
15Ezr 10:16 The returned exiles accepted the plan, so Ezra the priest appointed men from among the heads of the clans and recorded their names. On the first day of the tenth month they began their investigation, 
15Ezr 10:17 and within the next three months they investigated all the cases of men with foreign wives. 
15Ezr 10:18 This is the list of the men who had foreign wives�� Priests, listed by clans�� Clan of Joshua and his brothers, sons of Jehozadak�� Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
15Ezr 10:19 They promised to divorce their wives, and they offered a ram as a sacrifice for their sins.

15Ezr 10:44 All these men had foreign wives. They divorced them and sent them and their children away.

16Neh 1:1 This is the account of what Nehemiah son of Hacaliah accomplished. In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor of Persia, I, Nehemiah, was in Susa, the capital city. 
16Neh 1:2 Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived from Judah with another group, and I asked them about Jerusalem and about the other Jews who had returned from exile in Babylonia. 
16Neh 1:3 They told me that those who had survived and were back in the homeland were in great difficulty and that the foreigners who lived nearby looked down on them. They also told me that the walls of Jerusalem were still broken down and that the gates had not been restored since the time they were burned. 
16Neh 1:4 When I heard all this, I sat down and wept. For several days I mourned and did not eat. I prayed to God, 
16Neh 1:5 " LORD God of Heaven! You are great, and we stand in fear of you. You faithfully keep your covenant with those who love you and do what you command. 
16Neh 1:6 Look at me, LORD, and hear my prayer, as I pray day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess that we, the people of Israel, have sinned. My ancestors and I have sinned. 
16Neh 1:7 We have acted wickedly against you and have not done what you commanded. We have not kept the laws which you gave us through Moses, your servant. 
16Neh 1:8 Remember now what you told Moses�� 'If you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you among the other nations. 
16Neh 1:9 But then if you turn back to me and do what I have commanded you, I will bring you back to the place where I have chosen to be worshiped, even though you are scattered to the ends of the earth.' 
16Neh 1:10 "Lord, these are your servants, your own people. You rescued them by your great power and strength. 
16Neh 1:11 Listen now to my prayer and to the prayers of all your other servants who want to honor you. Give me success today and make the emperor merciful to me." In those days I was the emperor's wine steward. 
16Neh 2:1 One day four months later, when Emperor Artaxerxes was dining, I took the wine to him. He had never seen me look sad before, 
16Neh 2:2 so he asked, "Why are you looking so sad? You aren't sick, so it must be that you're unhappy." I was startled 
16Neh 2:3 and answered, "May Your Majesty live forever! How can I keep from looking sad when the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?" 
16Neh 2:4 The emperor asked, "What is it that you want?" I prayed to the God of Heaven, 
16Neh 2:5 and then I said to the emperor, "If Your Majesty is pleased with me and is willing to grant my request, let me go to the land of Judah, to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I can rebuild the city." 
16Neh 2:6 The emperor, with the empress sitting at his side, approved my request. He asked me how long I would be gone and when I would return, and I told him. 
16Neh 2:7 Then I asked him to grant me the favor of giving me letters to the governors of West-of-Euphrates Province, instructing them to let me travel to Judah. 
16Neh 2:8 I asked also for a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, instructing him to supply me with timber for the gates of the fort that guards the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house I was to live in. The emperor gave me all I asked for, because God was with me. 
16Neh 2:9 The emperor sent some army officers and a troop of cavalry with me, and I made the journey to West-of-Euphrates. There I gave the emperor's letters to the governors. 
16Neh 2:10 But Sanballat, from the town of Beth Horon, and Tobiah, an official in the province of Ammon, heard that someone had come to work for the good of the people of Israel, and they were highly indignant. 
16Neh 2:11 I went on to Jerusalem, and for three days 
16Neh 2:12 I did not tell anyone what God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. Then in the middle of the night I got up and went out, taking a few of my companions with me. The only animal we took was the donkey that I rode on. 
16Neh 2:13 It was still night as I left the city through the Valley Gate on the west and went south past Dragon's Fountain to the Rubbish Gate. As I went, I inspected the broken walls of the city and the gates that had been destroyed by fire. 
16Neh 2:14 Then on the east side of the city I went north to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool. The donkey I was riding could not find any path through the rubble, 
16Neh 2:15 so I went down into Kidron Valley and rode along, looking at the wall. Then I returned the way I had come and went back into the city through the Valley Gate. 
16Neh 2:16 None of the local officials knew where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had not said anything to any of the other Jews - the priests, the leaders, the officials, or anyone else who would be taking part in the work. 
16Neh 2:17 But now I said to them, "See what trouble we are in because Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates are destroyed! Let's rebuild the city walls and put an end to our disgrace." 
16Neh 2:18 And I told them how God had been with me and helped me, and what the emperor had said to me. They responded, "Let's start rebuilding!" And they got ready to start the work. 
16Neh 2:19 When Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arab named Geshem heard what we were planning to do, they laughed at us and said, "What do you think you're doing? Are you going to rebel against the emperor?" 
16Neh 2:20 I answered, "The God of Heaven will give us success. We are his servants, and we are going to start building. But you have no right to any property in Jerusalem, and you have no share in its traditions." 
16Neh 3:1 This is how the city wall was rebuilt. The High Priest Eliashib and his fellow priests rebuilt the Sheep Gate, dedicated it, and put the gates in place. They dedicated the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. 
16Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built the next section. Zaccur son of Imri built the next section. 
16Neh 3:3 The clan of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate. They put the beams and the gates in place, and put in the bolts and bars for locking the gate. 
16Neh 3:4 Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built the next section. Meshullam, the son of Berechiah and grandson of Meshezabel, built the next section. Zadok son of Baana built the next section. 
16Neh 3:5 The men of Tekoa built the next section, but the leading men of the town refused to do the manual labor assigned them by the supervisors. 
16Neh 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah rebuilt Jeshanah Gate. They put the beams and the gates in place, and put in the bolts and bars for locking the gate. 
16Neh 3:7 Melatiah from Gibeon, Jadon from Meronoth, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah built the next section, as far as the residence of the governor of West-of-Euphrates. 
16Neh 3:8 Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith, built the next section. Hananiah, a maker of perfumes, built the next section, as far as Broad Wall. 
16Neh 3:9 Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of half of the Jerusalem District, built the next section. 
16Neh 3:10 Jedaiah son of Harumaph built the next section, which was near his own house. Hattush son of Hashabneiah built the next section. 
16Neh 3:11 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath Moab built both the next section and the Tower of the Ovens. 
16Neh 3:12 Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of the other half of the Jerusalem District, built the next section. (His daughters helped with the work.) 
16Neh 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of the city of Zanoah rebuilt the Valley Gate. They put the gates in place, put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate, and repaired the wall for fifteen hundred feet, as far as the Rubbish Gate. 
16Neh 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the Beth Haccherem District, rebuilt the Rubbish Gate. He put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars for locking the gate. 
16Neh 3:15 Shallum son of Colhozeh, ruler of the Mizpah District, rebuilt the Fountain Gate. He covered the gateway, put the gates in place, and put in the bolts and the bars. At the Pool of Shelah he built the wall next to the royal garden, as far as the stairs leading down from David's City. 
16Neh 3:16 Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half of the Bethzur District, built the next section, as far as David's tomb, the pool, and the barracks. 
16Neh 3:17 The following Levites rebuilt the next several sections of the wall�� Rehum son of Bani built the next section; Hashabiah, ruler of half of the Keilah District, built the next section on behalf of his district; 
16Neh 3:18 Bavvai son of Henadad, ruler of the other half of the Keilah District, built the next section; 
16Neh 3:19 Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, built the next section in front of the armory, as far as the place where the wall turns; 
16Neh 3:20 Baruch son of Zabbai built the next section, as far as the entrance to the house of the High Priest Eliashib; 
16Neh 3:21 Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz, built the next section, up to the far end of Eliashib's house. 
16Neh 3:22 The following priests rebuilt the next several sections of the wall�� Priests from the area around Jerusalem built the next section; 
16Neh 3:23 Benjamin and Hasshub built the next section, which was in front of their houses; Azariah, the son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah, built the next section, which was in front of his house; 
16Neh 3:24 Binnui son of Henadad built the next section, from Azariah's house to the corner of the wall; 
16Neh 3:25 Palal son of Uzai built the next section, beginning at the corner of the wall and the tower of the upper palace near the court of the guard; 
16Neh 3:26 Pedaiah son of Parosh built the next section, to a point on the east near the Water Gate and the tower guarding the Temple. (This was near that part of the city called Ophel, where the Temple workers lived.) 
16Neh 3:27 The men of Tekoa built the next section, their second one, from a point opposite the large tower guarding the Temple as far as the wall near Ophel. 
16Neh 3:28 A group of priests built the next section, going north from the Horse Gate, each one building in front of his own house. 
16Neh 3:29 Zadok son of Immer built the next section, which was in front of his house. Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, keeper of the East Gate, built the next section. 
16Neh 3:30 Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, built the next section, their second one. Meshullam son of Berechiah built the next section, which was in front of his house. 
16Neh 3:31 Malchijah, a goldsmith, built the next section, as far as the building used by the Temple workers and the merchants, which was by the Miphkad Gate to the Temple, near the room on top of the northeast corner of the wall. 
16Neh 3:32 The goldsmiths and the merchants built the last section, from the room at the corner as far as the Sheep Gate. 
16Neh 4:1 When Sanballat heard that we Jews had begun rebuilding the wall, he became furious and began to ridicule us. 
16Neh 4:2 In front of his companions and the Samaritan troops he said, "What do these miserable Jews think they're doing? Do they intend to rebuild the city? Do they think that by offering sacrifices they can finish the work in one day? Can they make building stones out of heaps of burnt rubble?" 
16Neh 4:3 Tobiah was standing there beside him, and he added, "What kind of wall could they ever build? Even a fox could knock it down!" 
16Neh 4:4 I prayed, "Hear how they make fun of us, O God! Let their ridicule fall on their own heads. Let them be robbed of everything they have, and let them be taken as prisoners to a foreign land. 
16Neh 4:5 Don't forgive the evil they do and don't forget their sins, for they have insulted us who are building." 
16Neh 4:6 So we went on rebuilding the wall, and soon it was half its full height, because the people were eager to work. 
16Neh 4:7 Sanballat, Tobiah, and the people of Arabia, Ammon, and Ashdod heard that we were making progress in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem and that the gaps in the wall were being closed, and they became very angry. 
16Neh 4:8 So they all plotted together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion, 
16Neh 4:9 but we prayed to our God and kept men on guard against them day and night. 
16Neh 4:10 The people of Judah had a song they sang�� "We grow weak carrying burdens; There's so much rubble to take away. How can we build the wall today?" 
16Neh 4:11 Our enemies thought we would not see them or know what was happening until they were already upon us, killing us and putting an end to our work. 
16Neh 4:12 But time after time Jews who were living among our enemies came to warn us of the plans our enemies were making against us. 
16Neh 4:13 So I armed the people with swords, spears, and bows, and stationed them by clans behind the wall, wherever it was still unfinished. 
16Neh 4:14 I saw that the people were worried, so I said to them and to their leaders and officials, "Don't be afraid of our enemies. Remember how great and terrifying the Lord is, and fight for your relatives, your children, your wives, and your homes." 
16Neh 4:15 Our enemies heard that we had found out what they were plotting, and they realized that God had defeated their plans. Then all of us went back to rebuilding the wall. 
16Neh 4:16 From then on half of my men worked and half stood guard, wearing coats of armor and armed with spears, shields, and bows. And our leaders gave their full support to the people 
16Neh 4:17 who were rebuilding the wall. Even those who carried building materials worked with one hand and kept a weapon in the other, 
16Neh 4:18 and everyone who was building kept a sword strapped to their waist. The man who was to sound the alarm on the bugle stayed with me. 
16Neh 4:19 I told the people and their officials and leaders, "The work is spread out over such a distance that we are widely separated from one another on the wall. 
16Neh 4:20 If you hear the bugle, gather around me. Our God will fight for us." 
16Neh 4:21 So every day, from dawn until the stars came out at night, half of us worked on the wall, while the other half stood guard with spears. 
16Neh 4:22 During this time I told the men in charge that they and all their helpers had to stay in Jerusalem at night, so that we could guard the city at night as well as work in the daytime. 
16Neh 4:23 I didn't take off my clothes even at night, neither did any of my companions nor my servants nor my bodyguards. And we all kept our weapons at hand. 
16Neh 5:1 Some time later many of the people, both men and women, began to complain against the other Jews. 
16Neh 5:2 Some said, "We have large families, we need grain to keep us alive." 
16Neh 5:3 Others said, "We have had to mortgage our fields and vineyards and houses to get enough grain to keep us from starving." 
16Neh 5:4 Still others said, "We had to borrow money to pay the royal tax on our fields and vineyards. 
16Neh 5:5 We are of the same race as the other Jews. Aren't our children just as good as theirs? But we have to make slaves of our children. Some of our daughters have already been sold as slaves. We are helpless because our fields and vineyards have been taken away from us." 
16Neh 5:6 When I heard their complaints, I grew angry 
16Neh 5:7 and decided to act. I denounced the leaders and officials of the people and told them, "You are oppressing your own relatives!" I called a public assembly to deal with the problem 
16Neh 5:8 and said, "As far as we have been able, we have been buying back our Jewish relatives who had to sell themselves to foreigners. Now you are forcing your own relatives to sell themselves to you, their own people!" The leaders were silent and could find nothing to say. 
16Neh 5:9 Then I said, "What you are doing is wrong! You ought to obey God and do what's right. Then you would not give our enemies, the Gentiles, any reason to ridicule us. 
16Neh 5:10 I have let the people borrow money and grain from me, and so have my companions and those who work for me. Now let's give up all our claims to repayment. 
16Neh 5:11 Cancel all the debts they owe you - money or grain or wine or olive oil. And give them back their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses right now!" 
16Neh 5:12 The leaders replied, "We'll do as you say. We'll give the property back and not try to collect the debts." I called in the priests and made the leaders swear in front of them to keep the promise they had just made. 
16Neh 5:13 Then I took off the sash I was wearing around my waist and shook it out. "This is how God will shake any of you who don't keep your promise," I said. "God will take away your houses and everything you own, and will leave you with nothing." Everyone who was present said, "Amen!" and praised the LORD. And the leaders kept their promise. 
16Neh 5:14 During all the twelve years that I was governor of the land of Judah, from the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was emperor until his thirty-second year, neither my relatives nor I ate the food I was entitled to have as governor. 
16Neh 5:15 Every governor who had been in office before me had been a burden to the people and had demanded forty silver coins a day for food and wine. Even their servants had oppressed the people. But I acted differently, because I honored God. 
16Neh 5:16 I put all my energy into rebuilding the wall and did not acquire any property. Everyone who worked for me joined in the rebuilding. 
16Neh 5:17 I regularly fed at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jewish people and their leaders, besides all the people who came to me from the surrounding nations. 
16Neh 5:18 Every day I served one beef, six of the best sheep, and many chickens, and every ten days I provided a fresh supply of wine. But I knew what heavy burdens the people had to bear, and so I did not claim the allowance that the governor is entitled to. 
16Neh 5:19 I pray you, O God, remember to my credit everything that I have done for this people. 
16Neh 6:1 Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and the rest of our enemies heard that we had finished building the wall and that there were no gaps left in it, although we still had not set up the gates in the gateways. 
16Neh 6:2 So Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message, suggesting that I meet with them in one of the villages in the Plain of Ono. This was a trick of theirs to try to harm me. 
16Neh 6:3 I sent messengers to say to them, "I am doing important work and can't go down there. I am not going to let the work stop just to go and see you." 
16Neh 6:4 They sent me the same message four times, and each time I sent them the same reply. 
16Neh 6:5 Then Sanballat sent one of his servants to me with a fifth message, this one in the form of an unsealed letter. 
16Neh 6:6 It read�� "Geshem tells me that a rumor is going around among the neighboring peoples that you and the Jewish people intend to revolt and that this is why you are rebuilding the wall. He also says you plan to make yourself king 
16Neh 6:7 and that you have arranged for some prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem that you are the king of Judah. His Majesty is certain to hear about this, so I suggest that you and I meet to talk the situation over." 
16Neh 6:8 I sent a reply to him�� "Nothing of what you are saying is true. You have made it all up yourself." 
16Neh 6:9 They were trying to frighten us into stopping work. I prayed, "But now, God, make me strong!" 
16Neh 6:10 About this time I went to visit Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was unable to leave his house. He said to me, "You and I must go and hide together in the Holy Place of the Temple and lock the doors, because they are coming to kill you. Any night now they will come to kill you." 
16Neh 6:11 I answered, "I'm not the kind of person that runs and hides. Do you think I would try to save my life by hiding in the Temple? I won't do it." 
16Neh 6:12 When I thought it over, I realized that God had not spoken to Shemaiah, but that Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him to give me this warning. 
16Neh 6:13 They hired him to frighten me into sinning, so that they could ruin my reputation and humiliate me. 
16Neh 6:14 I prayed, "God, remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done and punish them. Remember that woman Noadiah and all the other prophets who tried to frighten me." 
16Neh 6:15 After fifty-two days of work the entire wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul. 
16Neh 6:16 When our enemies in the surrounding nations heard this, they realized that they had lost face, since everyone knew that the work had been done with God's help. 
16Neh 6:17 During all this time the Jewish leaders had been in correspondence with Tobiah. 
16Neh 6:18 Many people in Judah were on his side because of his Jewish father-in-law, Shecaniah son of Arah. In addition, his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 
16Neh 6:19 People would talk in front of me about all the good deeds Tobiah had done and would tell him everything I said. And he kept sending me letters to try to frighten me. 
16Neh 7:1 And now the wall had been rebuilt, the gates had all been put in place, and the Temple guards, the members of the sacred choir, and the other Levites had been assigned their work. 
16Neh 7:2 I put two men in charge of governing the city of Jerusalem�� my brother Hanani and Hananiah, commanding officer of the fortress. Hananiah was a reliable and God-fearing man without equal. 
16Neh 7:3 I told them not to have the gates of Jerusalem opened in the morning until well after sunrise and to have them closed and barred before the guards went off duty at sunset. I also told them to appoint guards from among the people who lived in Jerusalem and to assign some of them to specific posts and others to patrol the area around their own houses. 
16Neh 7:4 Jerusalem was a large city, but not many people were living in it, and not many houses had been built yet. 
16Neh 7:5 God inspired me to assemble the people and their leaders and officials and to check their family records. I located the records of those who had first returned from captivity, and this is the information I found��
16Neh 7:6 Many of the exiles left the province of Babylon and returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own hometown. Their families had been living in exile in Babylonia ever since King Nebuchadnezzar had taken them there as prisoners. 
16Neh 7:7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.

16Neh 7:57 Clans of Solomon's servants who returned from exile�� Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 
16Neh 7:58 Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, 
16Neh 7:59 Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth Hazzebaim, and Amon. 
16Neh 7:60 The total number of descendants of the Temple workers and of Solomon's servants who returned from exile was 392. 
16Neh 7:61 There were 642 belonging to the clans of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda who returned from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; 
16Neh 7:62 but they could not prove that they were descendants of Israelites. 
16Neh 7:63 The following priestly clans could find no record to prove their ancestry�� Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (The ancestor of the priestly clan of Barzillai had married a woman from the clan of Barzillai of Gilead and taken the name of his father-in-law's clan.) 
16Neh 7:64 Since they were unable to prove who their ancestors were, they were not accepted as priests. 
16Neh 7:65 The Jewish governor told them that they could not eat the food offered to God until there was a priest who could use the Urim and Thummim. 
16Neh 7:66 Total number of exiles who returned - 42,360. 
16Neh 7:67 Their male and female servants - 7,337. Male and female musicians - 245.
16Neh 7:68 Horses - 736. Mules - 245.
16Neh 7:69 Camels - 435. Donkeys - 6,720.
16Neh 7:70 Many of the people contributed to help pay the cost of restoring the Temple�� The governor�� 270 ounces of gold & 50 ceremonial bowls & 530 robes for priests.
16Neh 7:71 Heads of clans�� 337 pounds of gold & 3,215 pounds of silver.
16Neh 7:72 The rest of the people�� 337 pounds of gold & 2,923 pounds of silver & 67 robes for priests.
16Neh 7:73 The priests, the Levites, the Temple guards, the musicians, many of the ordinary people, the Temple workers - all the people of Israel - settled in the towns and cities of Judah. 
16Neh 8:1 By the seventh month the people of Israel were all settled in their towns. On the first day of that month they all assembled in Jerusalem, in the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law which the LORD had given Israel through Moses, to get the book of the Law. 
16Neh 8:2 So Ezra brought it to the place where the people had gathered - men, women, and the children who were old enough to understand. 
16Neh 8:3 There in the square by the gate he read the Law to them from dawn until noon, and they all listened attentively. 
16Neh 8:4 Ezra was standing on a wooden platform that had been built for the occasion. The following men stood at his right�� Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and the following stood at his left�� Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 
16Neh 8:5 As Ezra stood there on the platform high above the people, they all kept their eyes fixed on him. As soon as he opened the book, they all stood up. 
16Neh 8:6 Ezra said, "Praise the LORD, the great God!" All the people raised their arms in the air and answered, "Amen! Amen!" They knelt in worship, with their faces to the ground. 
16Neh 8:7 Then they rose and stood in their places, and the following Levites explained the Law to them�� Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah. 
16Neh 8:8 They gave an oral translation of God's Law and explained it so that the people could understand it. 
16Neh 8:9 When the people heard what the Law required, they were so moved that they began to cry. So Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra, the priest and scholar of the Law, and the Levites who were explaining the Law told all the people, "This day is holy to the LORD your God, so you are not to mourn or cry. 
16Neh 8:10 Now go home and have a feast. Share your food and wine with those who don't have enough. Today is holy to our Lord, so don't be sad. The joy that the LORD gives you will make you strong." 
16Neh 8:11 The Levites went around calming the people and telling them not to be sad on such a holy day. 
16Neh 8:12 So all the people went home and ate and drank joyfully and shared what they had with others, because they understood what had been read to them. 
16Neh 8:13 The next day the heads of the clans, together with the priests and the Levites, went to Ezra to study the teachings of the Law. 
16Neh 8:14 They discovered that the Law, which the LORD gave through Moses, ordered the people of Israel to live in temporary shelters during the Festival of Shelters. 
16Neh 8:15 So they gave the following instructions and sent them all through Jerusalem and the other cities and towns�� "Go out to the hills and get branches from pines, olives, myrtles, palms, and other trees to make shelters according to the instructions written in the Law." 
16Neh 8:16 So the people got branches and built shelters on the flat roofs of their houses, in their yards, in the Temple courtyard, and in the public squares by the Water Gate and by the Ephraim Gate. 
16Neh 8:17 All the people who had come back from captivity built shelters and lived in them. This was the first time it had been done since the days of Joshua son of Nun, and everybody was excited and happy. 
16Neh 8:18 From the first day of the festival to the last they read a part of God's Law every day. They celebrated for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a closing ceremony, as required in the Law. 
16Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of the same month the people of Israel gathered to fast in order to show sorrow for their sins. They had already separated themselves from all foreigners. They wore sackcloth and put dust on their heads as signs of grief. 
16Neh 9:2 Then they stood and began to confess the sins that they and their ancestors had committed.
16Neh 9:3 For about three hours the Law of the LORD their God was read to them, and for the next three hours they confessed their sins and worshiped the LORD their God. 
16Neh 9:4 There was a platform for the Levites, and on it stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani. They prayed aloud to the LORD their God. 
16Neh 9:5 The following Levites gave a call to worship�� Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah. They said�� "Stand up and praise the LORD your God; praise him forever and ever! Let everyone praise his glorious name, although no human praise is great enough." 
16Neh 9:6 And then the people of Israel prayed this prayer�� "You, LORD, you alone are LORD; you made the heavens and the stars of the sky. You made land and sea and everything in them; you gave life to all. The heavenly powers bow down and worship you. 
16Neh 9:7 You, LORD God, chose Abram and led him out of Ur in Babylonia; you changed his name to Abraham. 
16Neh 9:8 You found that he was faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him. You promised to give him the land of the Canaanites, the land of the Hittites and the Amorites, the land of the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Girgashites, to be a land where his descendants would live. You kept your promise, because you are faithful. 
16Neh 9:9 "You saw how our ancestors suffered in Egypt; you heard their call for help at the Red Sea. 
16Neh 9:10 You worked amazing miracles against the king, against his officials and the people of his land, because you knew how they oppressed your people. You won then the fame you still have today. 
16Neh 9:11 Through the sea you made a path for your people and led them through on dry ground. Those who pursued them drowned in deep water, as a stone sinks in the raging sea. 
16Neh 9:12 With a cloud you led them in daytime, and at night you lighted their way with fire. 
16Neh 9:13 At Mount Sinai you came down from heaven; you spoke to your people and gave them good laws and sound teachings. 
16Neh 9:14 You taught them to keep your Sabbaths holy, and through your servant Moses you gave them your laws. 
16Neh 9:15 "When they were hungry, you gave them bread from heaven, and water from a rock when they were thirsty. You told them to take control of the land which you had promised to give them. 
16Neh 9:16 But our ancestors grew proud and stubborn and refused to obey your commands. 
16Neh 9:17 They refused to obey; they forgot all you did; they forgot the miracles you had performed. In their pride they chose a leader to take them back to slavery in Egypt. But you are a God who forgives; you are gracious and loving, slow to be angry. Your mercy is great; you did not forsake them. 
16Neh 9:18 They made an idol in the shape of a bull-calf and said it was the god who led them from Egypt! How much they insulted you, LORD! 
16Neh 9:19 But you did not abandon them there in the desert, for your mercy is great. You did not take away the cloud or the fire that showed them the path by day and night. 
16Neh 9:20 In your goodness you told them what they should do; you fed them manna and gave them water to drink. 
16Neh 9:21 Through forty years in the desert you provided all that they needed; their clothing never wore out, and their feet were not swollen with pain. 
16Neh 9:22 "You let them conquer nations and kingdoms, lands that bordered their own. They conquered the land of Heshbon, where Sihon ruled, and the land of Bashan, where Og was king. 
16Neh 9:23 You gave them as many children as there are stars in the sky, and let them conquer and live in the land that you had promised their ancestors to give them. 
16Neh 9:24 They conquered the land of Canaan; you overcame the people living there. You gave your people the power to do as they pleased with the people and kings of Canaan. 
16Neh 9:25 Your people captured fortified cities, fertile land, houses full of wealth, cisterns already dug, olive trees, fruit trees, and vineyards. They ate all they wanted and grew fat; they enjoyed all the good things you gave them. 
16Neh 9:26 "But your people rebelled and disobeyed you; they turned their backs on your Law. They killed the prophets who warned them, who told them to turn back to you. They insulted you time after time, 
16Neh 9:27 so you let their enemies conquer and rule them. In their trouble they called to you for help, and you answered them from heaven. In your great mercy you sent them leaders who rescued them from their foes. 
16Neh 9:28 When peace returned, they sinned again, and again you let their enemies conquer them. Yet when they repented and asked you to save them, in heaven you heard, and time after time you rescued them in your great mercy. 
16Neh 9:29 You warned them to obey your teachings, but in pride they rejected your laws, although keeping your Law is the way to life. Hard-headed and stubborn, they refused to obey. 
16Neh 9:30 Year after year you patiently warned them. You inspired your prophets to speak, but your people were deaf, so you let them be conquered by other nations. 
16Neh 9:31 And yet, because your mercy is great, you did not forsake or destroy them. You are a gracious and merciful God! 
16Neh 9:32 "O God, our God, how great you are! How terrifying, how powerful! You faithfully keep your covenant promises. From the time when Assyrian kings oppressed us, even till now, how much we have suffered! Our kings, our leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors, and all our people have suffered. Remember how much we have suffered! 
16Neh 9:33 You have done right to punish us; you have been faithful, even though we have sinned. 
16Neh 9:34 Our ancestors, our kings, leaders, and priests have not kept your Law. They did not listen to your commands and warnings. 
16Neh 9:35 With your blessing, kings ruled your people when they lived in the broad, fertile land you gave them; but they failed to turn from sin and serve you. 
16Neh 9:36 And now we are slaves in the land that you gave us, this fertile land which gives us food. 
16Neh 9:37 What the land produces goes to the kings that you put over us because we sinned. They do as they please with us and our livestock, and we are in deep distress!" 
16Neh 9:38 Because of all that has happened, we, the people of Israel, hereby make a solemn written agreement, and our leaders, our Levites, and our priests put their seals to it.

16Neh 10:29 do hereby join with our leaders in an oath, under penalty of a curse if we break it, that we will live according to God's Law, which God gave through his servant Moses; that we will obey all that the LORD, our Lord, commands us; and that we will keep all his laws and requirements. 
16Neh 10:30 We will not intermarry with the foreigners living in our land. 
16Neh 10:31 If foreigners bring grain or anything else to sell to us on the Sabbath or on any other holy day, we will not buy from them. Every seventh year we will not farm the land, and we will cancel all debts. 
16Neh 10:32 Every year we will each contribute one-eighth of an ounce of silver to help pay the expenses of the Temple. 
16Neh 10:33 We will provide for the Temple worship the following�� the sacred bread, the daily grain offering, the animals to be burned each day as sacrifices, the sacred offerings for Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other festivals, the other sacred offerings, the offerings to take away the sins of Israel, and anything else needed for the Temple. 
16Neh 10:34 We, the people, priests, and Levites, will draw lots each year to determine which clans are to provide wood to burn the sacrifices offered to the LORD our God, according to the requirements of the Law. 
16Neh 10:35 We will take to the Temple each year an offering of the first grain we harvest and of the first fruit that ripens on our trees. 
16Neh 10:36 The first son born to each of us we will take to the priests in the Temple and there, as required by the Law, dedicate him to God. We will also dedicate the first calf born to each of our cows, and the first lamb or kid born to each of our sheep or goats. 
16Neh 10:37 We will take to the priests in the Temple the dough made from the first grain harvested each year and our other offerings of wine, olive oil, and all kinds of fruit. We will take to the Levites, who collect tithes in our farming villages, the tithes from the crops that grow on our land. 
16Neh 10:38 Priests who are descended from Aaron are to be with the Levites when tithes are collected, and for use in the Temple the Levites are to take to the Temple storerooms one-tenth of all the tithes they collect. 
16Neh 10:39 The people of Israel and the Levites are to take the contributions of grain, wine, and olive oil to the storerooms where the utensils for the Temple are kept and where the priests who are on duty, the Temple guards, and the members of the Temple choir have their quarters. We will not neglect the house of our God. 
16Neh 11:1 The leaders settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people drew lots to choose one family out of every ten to go and live in the holy city of Jerusalem, while the rest were to live in the other cities and towns. 
16Neh 11:2 The people praised anyone else who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.

16Neh 11:21 The Temple workers lived in the part of Jerusalem called Ophel and worked under the supervision of Ziha and Gishpa. 
16Neh 11:22 The supervisor of the Levites who lived in Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son of Bani and grandson of Hashabiah. His ancestors included Mattaniah and Mica, and he belonged to the clan of Asaph, the clan that was responsible for the music in the Temple services. 
16Neh 11:23 There were royal regulations stating how the clans should take turns in leading the Temple music each day. 
16Neh 11:24 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the clan of Zerah and the tribe of Judah, represented the people of Israel at the Persian court. 
16Neh 11:25 Many of the people lived in towns near their farms. Those who were of the tribe of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba, Dibon, and Jekabzeel, and in the villages near these cities. 
16Neh 11:26 They also lived in the cities of Jeshua, Moladah, Bethpelet,

16Neh 11:32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
16Neh 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 
16Neh 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 
16Neh 11:35 Lod, and Ono, and in Craftsmen's Valley. 
16Neh 11:36 Some groups of Levites that had lived in the territory of Judah were assigned to live with the people of Benjamin. 
16Neh 12:1 The following is a list of the priests and Levites who returned from exile with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with the High Priest Joshua��
16Neh 12:2 Priests�� Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16Neh 12:3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 
16Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,

16Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16Neh 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These men were leaders among all their fellow priests in the days of Joshua. 
16Neh 12:8 Levites�� The following were in charge of the singing of hymns of thanksgiving�� Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah.
16Neh 12:9 The following formed the choir that sang the responses�� Bakbukiah, Unno, and their fellow Levites. 
16Neh 12:10 Joshua was the father of Joiakim; Joiakim was the father of Eliashib; Eliashib was the father of Joiada; 
16Neh 12:11 Joiada was the father of Jonathan; and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua. 
16Neh 12:12 When Joiakim was High Priest, the following priests were the heads of the priestly clans�� [Priest�� Clan] Meraiah�� Seraiah, Hananiah�� Jeremiah, 
16Neh 12:13 Meshullam�� Ezra, Jehohanan�� Amariah,

16Neh 12:22 A record was kept of the heads of the Levite families and of the priestly families during the lifetimes of the following High Priests�� Eliashib, Joiada, Jonathan, and Jaddua. This record was finished when Darius was emperor of Persia. 
16Neh 12:23 The heads of the Levite families, however, were recorded in the official records only until the time of Jonathan, the grandson of Eliashib. 
16Neh 12:24 Under the direction of Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, and Kadmiel, the Levites were organized into groups. Two groups at a time praised God responsively and gave thanks to him, in accordance with the instructions given by King David, the man of God. 
16Neh 12:25 The following Temple guards were in charge of guarding the storerooms by the gates to the Temple�� Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub. 
16Neh 12:26 These people lived during the time of Joiakim, the son of Joshua and grandson of Jehozadak, and the time of Nehemiah the governor, and the time of Ezra, the priest who was a scholar of the Law. 
16Neh 12:27 When the city wall of Jerusalem was dedicated, the Levites were brought in from wherever they were living, so that they could join in celebrating the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals and harps. 
16Neh 12:28 The Levite families of singers gathered from the area where they had settled around Jerusalem and from the towns around Netophah, 
16Neh 12:29 and from Bethgilgal, Geba, and Azmaveth. 
16Neh 12:30 The priests and the Levites performed ritual purification for themselves, the people, the gates, and the city wall. 
16Neh 12:31 I assembled the leaders of Judah on top of the wall and put them in charge of two large groups to march around the city, giving thanks to God. The first group went to the right on top of the wall toward the Rubbish Gate. 
16Neh 12:32 Hoshaiah marched behind the singers, followed by half the leaders of Judah. 
16Neh 12:33 The following priests, blowing trumpets, marched next�� 
16Neh 12:34 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
16Neh 12:35 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. Next came Zechariah, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Shemaiah. (His ancestors also included Mattaniah, Micaiah, and Zaccur, of the clan of Asaph.) 
16Neh 12:36 He was followed by other members of his clan - Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani - all of whom carried musical instruments of the kind played by King David, the man of God. Ezra the scholar led this group in the procession. 
16Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they went up the steps that led to David's City, past David's palace, and back to the wall at the Water Gate, on the east side of the city. 
16Neh 12:38 The other group of those who gave thanks went to the left along the top of the wall, and I followed with half of the people. We marched past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
16Neh 12:39 and from there we went past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. We ended our march near the gate to the Temple. 
16Neh 12:40 So both the groups that were giving thanks to God reached the Temple area. In addition to the leaders who were with me, 
16Neh 12:41 my group included the following priests, blowing trumpets�� Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah; 
16Neh 12:42 and they were followed by Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers, led by Jezrahiah, sang at the top of their voices. 
16Neh 12:43 That day many sacrifices were offered, and the people were full of joy because God had made them very happy. The women and the children joined in the celebration, and the noise they all made could be heard for miles. 
16Neh 12:44 At that time men were put in charge of the storerooms where contributions for the Temple were kept, including the tithes and the first grain and fruit that ripened each year. These men were responsible for collecting from the farms near the various cities the contributions for the priests and the Levites which the Law required. All the people of Judah were pleased with the priests and the Levites, 
16Neh 12:45 because they performed the ceremonies of purification and the other rituals that God had commanded. The Temple musicians and the Temple guards also performed their duties in accordance with the regulations made by King David and his son Solomon. 
16Neh 12:46 From the time of King David and the musician Asaph long ago, the musicians have led songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
16Neh 12:47 In the time of Zerubbabel and also in the time of Nehemiah, all the people of Israel gave daily gifts for the support of the Temple musicians and the Temple guards. The people gave a sacred offering to the Levites, and the Levites gave the required portion to the priests. 
16Neh 13:1 When the Law of Moses was being read aloud to the people, they came to the passage that said that no Ammonite or Moabite was ever to be permitted to join God's people. 
16Neh 13:2 This was because the people of Ammon and Moab did not give food and water to the Israelites on their way out of Egypt. Instead, they paid money to Balaam to curse Israel, but our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
16Neh 13:3 When the people of Israel heard this law read, they excluded all foreigners from the community. 
16Neh 13:4 The priest Eliashib, who was in charge of the Temple storerooms, had for a long time been on good terms with Tobiah. 
16Neh 13:5 He allowed Tobiah to use a large room that was intended only for storing offerings of grain and incense, the equipment used in the Temple, the offerings for the priests, and the tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil given to the Levites, to the Temple musicians, and to the Temple guards. 
16Neh 13:6 While this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the thirty-second year that Artaxerxes was king of Babylon I had gone back to report to him. After some time I received his permission 
16Neh 13:7 and returned to Jerusalem. There I was shocked to find that Eliashib had allowed Tobiah to use a room in the Temple. 
16Neh 13:8 I was furious and threw out all of Tobiah's belongings. 
16Neh 13:9 I gave orders for the rooms to be ritually purified and for the Temple equipment, grain offerings, and incense to be put back. 
16Neh 13:10 I also learned that the Temple musicians and other Levites had left Jerusalem and gone back to their farms, because the people had not been giving them enough to live on. 
16Neh 13:11 I reprimanded the officials for letting the Temple be neglected. And I brought the Levites and musicians back to the Temple and put them to work again. 
16Neh 13:12 Then all the people of Israel again started bringing to the Temple storerooms their tithes of grain, wine, and olive oil. 
16Neh 13:13 I put the following men in charge of the storerooms�� Shelemiah, a priest; Zadok, a scholar of the Law; and Pedaiah, a Levite. Hanan, the son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah, was to be their assistant. I knew I could trust these men to be honest in distributing the supplies to the other workers. 
16Neh 13:14 Remember, my God, all these things that I have done for your Temple and its worship. 
16Neh 13:15 At that time I saw people in Judah pressing juice from grapes on the Sabbath. Others were loading grain, wine, grapes, figs, and other things on their donkeys and taking them into Jerusalem; I warned them not to sell anything on the Sabbath. 
16Neh 13:16 Some people from the city of Tyre were living in Jerusalem, and they brought fish and all kinds of goods into the city to sell to our people on the Sabbath. 
16Neh 13:17 I reprimanded the Jewish leaders and told them, "Look at the evil you're doing! You're making the Sabbath unholy. 
16Neh 13:18 This is exactly why God punished your ancestors when he brought destruction on this city. And yet you insist on bringing more of God's anger down on Israel by profaning the Sabbath." 
16Neh 13:19 So I gave orders for the city gates to be shut at the beginning of every Sabbath, as soon as evening began to fall, and not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my men at the gates to make sure that nothing was brought into the city on the Sabbath. 
16Neh 13:20 Once or twice merchants who sold all kinds of goods spent Friday night outside the city walls. 
16Neh 13:21 I warned them, "It's no use waiting out there for morning to come. If you try this again, I'll use force on you." From then on they did not come back on the Sabbath. 
16Neh 13:22 I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to go and guard the gates to make sure that the Sabbath was kept holy. Remember me, O God, for this also, and spare me because of your great love. 
16Neh 13:23 At that time I also discovered that many of the Jewish men had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
16Neh 13:24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or some other language and didn't know how to speak our language. 
16Neh 13:25 I reprimanded the men, called down curses on them, beat them, and pulled out their hair. Then I made them take an oath in God's name that never again would they or their children intermarry with foreigners. 
16Neh 13:26 I told them, "It was foreign women that made King Solomon sin. Here was a man who was greater than any of the kings of other nations. God loved him and made him king over all of Israel, and yet he fell into this sin. 
16Neh 13:27 Are we then to follow your example and disobey our God by marrying foreign women?" 
16Neh 13:28 Joiada was the son of Eliashib the High Priest, but one of Joiada's sons married the daughter of Sanballat, from the town of Beth Horon, so I made Joiada leave Jerusalem. 
16Neh 13:29 Remember, God, how those people defiled both the office of priest and the covenant you made with the priests and the Levites. 
16Neh 13:30 I purified the people from everything foreign; I prepared regulations for the priests and the Levites so that all of them would know their duties; 
16Neh 13:31 I arranged for the wood used for burning the offerings to be brought at the proper times, and for the people to bring their offerings of the first grain and the first fruits that ripened. Remember all this, O God, and give me credit for it.

17Est 1:1 From his royal throne in Persia's capital city of Susa, King Xerxes ruled 127 provinces,
17Est 1:2 all the way from India to Ethiopia. 
17Est 1:3 In the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his officials and administrators. The armies of Persia and Media were present, as well as the governors and noblemen of the provinces. 
17Est 1:4 For six whole months he made a show of the riches of the imperial court with all its splendor and majesty. 
17Est 1:5 After that, the king gave a banquet for all the people in the capital city of Susa, rich and poor alike. It lasted a whole week and was held in the gardens of the royal palace. 
17Est 1:6 The courtyard there was decorated with blue and white cotton curtains, tied by cords of fine purple linen to silver rings on marble columns. Couches made of gold and silver had been placed in the courtyard, which was paved with white marble, red feldspar, shining mother-of-pearl, and blue turquoise. 
17Est 1:7 Drinks were served in gold cups, no two of them alike, and the king was generous with the royal wine. 
17Est 1:8 There were no limits on the drinks; the king had given orders to the palace servants that everyone could have as much as they wanted. 
17Est 1:9 Meanwhile, inside the royal palace Queen Vashti was giving a banquet for the women. 
17Est 1:10 On the seventh day of his banquet the king was drinking and feeling happy, so he called in the seven eunuchs who were his personal servants, Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas. 
17Est 1:11 He ordered them to bring in Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown. The queen was a beautiful woman, and the king wanted to show off her beauty to the officials and all his guests. 
17Est 1:12 But when the servants told Queen Vashti of the king's command, she refused to come. This made the king furious. 
17Est 1:13 Now it was the king's custom to ask for expert opinion on questions of law and order, so he called for his advisers, who would know what should be done. 
17Est 1:14 Those he most often turned to for advice were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan - seven officials of Persia and Media who held the highest offices in the kingdom. 
17Est 1:15 He said to these men, "I, King Xerxes, sent my servants to Queen Vashti with a command, and she refused to obey it! What does the law say that we should do with her?" 
17Est 1:16 Then Memucan declared to the king and his officials�� "Queen Vashti has insulted not only the king but also his officials - in fact, every man in the empire! 
17Est 1:17 Every woman in the empire will start looking down on her husband as soon as she hears what the queen has done. They'll say, 'King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to come to him, and she refused.' 
17Est 1:18 When the wives of the royal officials of Persia and Media hear about the queen's behavior, they will be telling their husbands about it before the day is out. Wives everywhere will have no respect for their husbands, and husbands will be angry with their wives. 
17Est 1:19 If it please Your Majesty, issue a royal proclamation that Vashti may never again appear before the king. Have it written into the laws of Persia and Media, so that it can never be changed. Then give her place as queen to some better woman. 
17Est 1:20 When your proclamation is made known all over this huge empire, every woman will treat her husband with proper respect, whether he's rich or poor." 
17Est 1:21 The king and his officials liked this idea, and the king did what Memucan suggested. 
17Est 1:22 To each of the royal provinces he sent a message in the language and the system of writing of that province, saying that every husband should be the master of his home and speak with final authority. 
17Est 2:1 Later, even after the king's anger had cooled down, he kept thinking about what Vashti had done and about his proclamation against her. 
17Est 2:2 So some of the king's advisers who were close to him suggested, "Why don't you make a search to find some beautiful young virgins? 
17Est 2:3 You can appoint officials in every province of the empire and have them bring all these beautiful young women to your harem here in Susa, the capital city. Put them in the care of Hegai, the eunuch who is in charge of your women, and let them be given a beauty treatment. 
17Est 2:4 Then take the young woman you like best and make her queen in Vashti's place." The king thought this was good advice, so he followed it. 
17Est 2:5 There in Susa lived a Jew named Mordecai son of Jair; he was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei. 
17Est 2:6 When King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took King Jehoiachin of Judah into exile from Jerusalem, along with a group of captives, Mordecai was among them. 
17Est 2:7 He had a cousin, Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah; she was a beautiful young woman, and had a good figure. At the death of her parents, Mordecai had adopted her and brought her up as his own daughter. 
17Est 2:8 When the king had issued his new proclamation and many young women were being brought to Susa, Esther was among them. She too was put in the royal palace in the care of Hegai, who had charge of the harem. 
17Est 2:9 Hegai liked Esther, and she won his favor. He lost no time in beginning her beauty treatment of massage and special diet. He gave her the best place in the harem and assigned seven young women specially chosen from the royal palace to serve her. 
17Est 2:10 Now, on the advice of Mordecai, Esther had kept it secret that she was Jewish. 
17Est 2:11 Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard of the harem, in order to find out how she was getting along and what was going to happen to her. 
17Est 2:12 The regular beauty treatment for the women lasted a year - massages with oil of myrrh for six months and with oil of balsam for six more. After that, each woman would be taken in turn to King Xerxes. 
17Est 2:13 When she went from the harem to the palace, she could wear whatever she wanted. 
17Est 2:14 She would go there in the evening, and the next morning she would be taken to another harem and put in the care of Shaashgaz, the eunuch in charge of the king's concubines. She would not go to the king again unless he liked her enough to ask for her by name. 
17Est 2:15 The time came for Esther to go to the king. Esther - the daughter of Abihail and the cousin of Mordecai, who had adopted her as his daughter; Esther - admired by everyone who saw her. When her turn came, she wore just what Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem, advised her to wear. 
17Est 2:16 So in Xerxes' seventh year as king, in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, Esther was brought to King Xerxes in the royal palace. 
17Est 2:17 The king liked her more than any of the other women, and more than any of the others she won his favor and affection. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 
17Est 2:18 Then the king gave a great banquet in Esther's honor and invited all his officials and administrators. He proclaimed a holiday for the whole empire and distributed gifts worthy of a king. 
17Est 2:19 Meanwhile Mordecai had been appointed by the king to an administrative position. 
17Est 2:20 As for Esther, she had still not let it be known that she was Jewish. Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone, and she obeyed him in this, just as she had obeyed him when she was a little girl under his care. 
17Est 2:21 During the time that Mordecai held office in the palace, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the palace eunuchs who guarded the entrance to the king's rooms, became hostile to King Xerxes and plotted to assassinate him. 
17Est 2:22 Mordecai learned about it and told Queen Esther, who then told the king what Mordecai had found out. 
17Est 2:23 There was an investigation, and it was discovered that the report was true, so both men were hanged on the gallows. The king ordered an account of this to be written down in the official records of the empire. 
17Est 3:1 Some time later King Xerxes promoted a man named Haman to the position of prime minister. Haman was the son of Hammedatha, a descendant of Agag. 
17Est 3:2 The king ordered all the officials in his service to show their respect for Haman by kneeling and bowing to him. They all did so, except for Mordecai, who refused to do it. 
17Est 3:3 The other officials in the royal service asked him why he was disobeying the king's command; 
17Est 3:4 day after day they urged him to give in, but he would not listen to them. "I am a Jew," he explained, "and I cannot bow to Haman." So they told Haman about this, wondering if he would tolerate Mordecai's conduct. 
17Est 3:5 Haman was furious when he realized that Mordecai was not going to kneel and bow to him, 
17Est 3:6 and when he learned that Mordecai was a Jew, he decided to do more than punish Mordecai alone. He made plans to kill every Jew in the whole Persian Empire. 
17Est 3:7 In the twelfth year of King Xerxes' rule, in the first month, the month of Nisan, Haman ordered the lots to be cast ("purim," they were called) to find out the right day and month to carry out his plot. The thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, was decided on. 
17Est 3:8 So Haman told the king, "There is a certain race of people scattered all over your empire and found in every province. They observe customs that are not like those of any other people. Moreover, they do not obey the laws of the empire, so it is not in your best interests to tolerate them. 
17Est 3:9 If it please Your Majesty, issue a decree that they are to be put to death. If you do, I guarantee that I will be able to put 375 tons of silver into the royal treasury for the administration of the empire." 
17Est 3:10 The king took off his ring, which was used to stamp proclamations and make them official, and gave it to the enemy of the Jewish people, Haman son of Hammedatha, the descendant of Agag. 
17Est 3:11 The king told him, "The people and their money are yours; do as you like with them." 
17Est 3:12 So on the thirteenth day of the first month Haman called the king's secretaries and dictated a proclamation to be translated into every language and system of writing used in the empire and to be sent to all the rulers, governors, and officials. It was issued in the name of King Xerxes and stamped with his ring. 
17Est 3:13 Runners took this proclamation to every province of the empire. It contained the instructions that on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, all Jews - young and old, women and children - were to be killed. They were to be slaughtered without mercy and their belongings were to be taken. 
17Est 3:14 The contents of the proclamation were to be made public in every province, so that everyone would be prepared when that day came. 
17Est 3:15 At the king's command the decree was made public in the capital city of Susa, and runners carried the news to the provinces. The king and Haman sat down and had a drink while the city of Susa was being thrown into confusion. 
17Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes in anguish. Then he dressed in sackcloth, covered his head with ashes, and walked through the city, wailing loudly and bitterly, 
17Est 4:2 until he came to the entrance of the palace. He did not go in because no one wearing sackcloth was allowed inside. 
17Est 4:3 Throughout all the provinces, wherever the king's proclamation was made known, there was loud mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, wailed, and most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes. 
17Est 4:4 When Esther's servant women and eunuchs told her what Mordecai was doing, she was deeply disturbed. She sent Mordecai some clothes to put on instead of the sackcloth, but he would not accept them. 
17Est 4:5 Then she called Hathach, one of the palace eunuchs appointed as her servant by the king, and told him to go to Mordecai and find out what was happening and why. 
17Est 4:6 Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square at the entrance of the palace. 
17Est 4:7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him and just how much money Haman had promised to put into the royal treasury if all the Jews were killed. 
17Est 4:8 He gave Hathach a copy of the proclamation that had been issued in Susa, ordering the destruction of the Jews. Mordecai asked him to take it to Esther, explain the situation to her, and have her go and plead with the king and beg him to have mercy on her people. 
17Est 4:9 Hathach did this, 
17Est 4:10 and Esther gave him this message to take back to Mordecai��
17Est 4:11 "If anyone, man or woman, goes to the inner courtyard and sees the king without being summoned, that person must die. That is the law; everyone, from the king's advisers to the people in the provinces, knows that. There is only one way to get around this law�� if the king holds out his gold scepter to someone, then that person's life is spared. But it has been a month since the king sent for me." 
17Est 4:12 When Mordecai received Esther's message, 
17Est 4:13 he sent her this warning�� "Don't imagine that you are safer than any other Jew just because you are in the royal palace. 
17Est 4:14 If you keep quiet at a time like this, help will come from heaven to the Jews, and they will be saved, but you will die and your father's family will come to an end. Yet who knows - maybe it was for a time like this that you were made queen!" 
17Est 4:15 Esther sent Mordecai this reply��
17Est 4:16 "Go and get all the Jews in Susa together; hold a fast and pray for me. Don't eat or drink anything for three days and nights. My servant women and I will be doing the same. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. If I must die for doing it, I will die." 
17Est 4:17 Mordecai then left and did everything that Esther had told him to do. 
17Est 5:1 On the third day of her fast Esther put on her royal robes and went and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace, facing the throne room. The king was inside, seated on the royal throne, facing the entrance. 
17Est 5:2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing outside, she won his favor, and he held out to her the gold scepter. She then came up and touched the tip of it. 
17Est 5:3 "What is it, Queen Esther?" the king asked. "Tell me what you want, and you shall have it - even if it is half my empire." 
17Est 5:4 Esther replied, "If it please Your Majesty, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tonight at a banquet I am preparing for you." 
17Est 5:5 The king then ordered Haman to come quickly, so that they could be Esther's guests. So the king and Haman went to Esther's banquet. 
17Est 5:6 Over the wine the king asked her, "Tell me what you want, and you shall have it. I will grant your request, even if you ask for half my empire." 
17Est 5:7 Esther replied, 
17Est 5:8 "If Your Majesty is kind enough to grant my request, I would like you and Haman to be my guests tomorrow at another banquet that I will prepare for you. At that time I will tell you what I want." 
17Est 5:9 When Haman left the banquet he was happy and in a good mood. But then he saw Mordecai at the entrance of the palace, and when Mordecai did not rise or show any sign of respect as he passed, Haman was furious with him. 
17Est 5:10 But he controlled himself and went on home. Then he invited his friends to his house and asked his wife Zeresh to join them. 
17Est 5:11 He boasted to them about how rich he was, how many sons he had, how the king had promoted him to high office, and how much more important he was than any of the king's other officials. 
17Est 5:12 "What is more," Haman went on, "Queen Esther gave a banquet for no one but the king and me, and we are invited back tomorrow. 
17Est 5:13 But none of this means a thing to me as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the entrance of the palace." 
17Est 5:14 So his wife and all his friends suggested, "Why don't you have a gallows built, seventy-five feet tall? Tomorrow morning you can ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it, and then you can go to the banquet happy." Haman thought this was a good idea, so he had the gallows built. 
17Est 6:1 That same night the king could not get to sleep, so he had the official records of the empire brought and read to him. 
17Est 6:2 The part they read included the account of how Mordecai had uncovered a plot to assassinate the king - the plot made by Bigthana and Teresh, the two palace eunuchs who had guarded the king's rooms. 
17Est 6:3 The king asked, "How have we honored and rewarded Mordecai for this?" His servants answered, "Nothing has been done for him." 
17Est 6:4 "Are any of my officials in the palace?" the king asked. Now Haman had just entered the courtyard; he had come to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows that was now ready. 
17Est 6:5 So the servants answered, "Haman is here, waiting to see you." "Show him in," said the king. 
17Est 6:6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "There is someone I wish very much to honor. What should I do for this man?" Haman thought to himself, "Now who could the king want to honor so much? Me, of course." 
17Est 6:7 So he answered the king, "Have royal robes brought for this man - robes that you yourself wear.
17Est 6:8 Have a royal ornament put on your own horse. 
17Est 6:9 Then have one of your highest noblemen dress the man in these robes and lead him, mounted on the horse, through the city square. Have the nobleman announce as they go�� 'See how the king rewards someone he wishes to honor!' " 
17Est 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, "Hurry and get the robes and the horse, and provide these honors for Mordecai the Jew. Do everything for him that you have suggested. You will find him sitting at the entrance of the palace." 
17Est 6:11 So Haman got the robes and the horse, and he put the robes on Mordecai. Mordecai got on the horse, and Haman led him through the city square, announcing to the people as they went�� "See how the king rewards a man he wishes to honor!" 
17Est 6:12 Mordecai then went back to the palace entrance while Haman hurried home, covering his face in embarrassment. 
17Est 6:13 He told his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then she and those wise friends of his told him, "You are beginning to lose power to Mordecai. He is a Jew, and you cannot overcome him. He will certainly defeat you." 
17Est 6:14 While they were still talking, the palace eunuchs arrived in a hurry to take Haman to Esther's banquet. 
17Est 7:1 And so the king and Haman went to eat with Esther 
17Est 7:2 for a second time. Over the wine the king asked her again, "Now, Queen Esther, what do you want? Tell me and you shall have it. I'll even give you half the empire." 
17Est 7:3 Queen Esther answered, "If it please Your Majesty to grant my humble request, my wish is that I may live and that my people may live. 
17Est 7:4 My people and I have been sold for slaughter. If it were nothing more serious than being sold into slavery, I would have kept quiet and not bothered you about it; but we are about to be destroyed - exterminated!" 
17Est 7:5 Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, "Who dares to do such a thing? Where is this man?" 
17Est 7:6 Esther answered, "Our enemy, our persecutor, is this evil man Haman!" Haman faced the king and queen with terror. 
17Est 7:7 The king got up in a fury, left the room, and went outside to the palace gardens. Haman could see that the king was determined to punish him for this, so he stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 
17Est 7:8 He had just thrown himself down on Esther's couch to beg for mercy, when the king came back into the room from the gardens. Seeing this, the king cried out, "Is this man going to rape the queen right here in front of me, in my own palace?" The king had no sooner said this than the eunuchs covered Haman's head. 
17Est 7:9 Then one of them, who was named Harbonah, said, "Haman even went so far as to build a gallows at his house so that he could hang Mordecai, who saved Your Majesty's life. And it's seventy-five feet tall!" "Hang Haman on it!" the king commanded. 
17Est 7:10 So Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had built for Mordecai. Then the king's anger cooled down. 
17Est 8:1 That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther all the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Esther told the king that Mordecai was related to her, and from then on Mordecai was allowed to enter the king's presence. 
17Est 8:2 The king took off his ring with his seal on it (which he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property. 
17Est 8:3 Then Esther spoke to the king again, throwing herself at his feet and crying. She begged him to do something to stop the evil plot that Haman, the descendant of Agag, had made against the Jews. 
17Est 8:4 The king held out the gold scepter to her, so she stood up and said, 
17Est 8:5 "If it please Your Majesty, and if you care about me and if it seems right to you, please issue a proclamation to keep Haman's orders from being carried out - those orders that the son of Hammedatha the descendant of Agag gave for the destruction of all the Jews in the empire. 
17Est 8:6 How can I endure it if this disaster comes on my people, and my own relatives are killed?" 
17Est 8:7 King Xerxes then said to Queen Esther and Mordecai, the Jew, "Look, I have hanged Haman for his plot against the Jews, and I have given Esther his property. 
17Est 8:8 But a proclamation issued in the king's name and stamped with the royal seal cannot be revoked. You may, however, write to the Jews whatever you like; and you may write it in my name and stamp it with the royal seal." 
17Est 8:9 This happened on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. Mordecai called the king's secretaries and dictated letters to the Jews and to the governors, administrators, and officials of all the 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were written to each province in its own language and system of writing and to the Jews in their language and system of writing. 
17Est 8:10 Mordecai had the letters written in the name of King Xerxes, and he stamped them with the royal seal. They were delivered by riders mounted on fast horses from the royal stables. 
17Est 8:11 These letters explained that the king would allow the Jews in every city to organize for self-defense. If armed men of any nationality in any province attacked the Jewish men, their children, or their women, the Jews could fight back and destroy the attackers; they could slaughter them to the last man and take their possessions. 
17Est 8:12 This decree was to take effect throughout the Persian Empire on the day set for the slaughter of the Jews, the thirteenth of Adar, the twelfth month. 
17Est 8:13 It was to be proclaimed as law and made known to everyone in every province, so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies when that day came. 
17Est 8:14 At the king's command the riders mounted royal horses and rode off at top speed. The decree was also made public in Susa, the capital city. 
17Est 8:15 Mordecai left the palace, wearing royal robes of blue and white, a cloak of fine purple linen, and a magnificent gold crown. Then the streets of Susa rang with cheers and joyful shouts. 
17Est 8:16 For the Jews there was joy and relief, happiness and a sense of victory. 
17Est 8:17 In every city and province, wherever the king's proclamation was read, the Jews held a joyful holiday with feasting and happiness. In fact, many other people became Jews, because they were afraid of them now. 
17Est 9:1 The thirteenth day of Adar came, the day on which the royal proclamation was to take effect, the day when the enemies of the Jews were hoping to get them in their power. But instead, the Jews triumphed over them. 
17Est 9:2 In the Jewish quarter of every city in the empire the Jews organized to attack anyone who tried to harm them. People everywhere were afraid of them, and no one could stand against them. 
17Est 9:3 In fact, all the provincial officials - governors, administrators, and royal representatives - helped the Jews because they were all afraid of Mordecai. 
17Est 9:4 It was well-known throughout the empire that Mordecai was now a powerful man in the palace and was growing more powerful. 
17Est 9:5 So the Jews could do what they wanted with their enemies. They attacked them with swords and slaughtered them. 
17Est 9:6 In Susa, the capital city itself, the Jews killed five hundred people. 
17Est 9:7 Among them were the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews�� 
17Est 9:8 Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17Est 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. 
17Est 9:10 However, there was no looting. 
17Est 9:11 That same day the number of people killed in Susa was reported to the king. 
17Est 9:12 He then said to Queen Esther, "In Susa alone the Jews have killed five hundred people, including Haman's ten sons. What must they have done out in the provinces! What do you want now? You shall have it. Tell me what else you want, and you shall have it." 
17Est 9:13 Esther answered, "If it please Your Majesty, let the Jews in Susa do again tomorrow what they were allowed to do today. And have the bodies of Haman's ten sons hung from the gallows." 
17Est 9:14 The king ordered this to be done, and the proclamation was issued in Susa. The bodies of Haman's ten sons were publicly displayed. 
17Est 9:15 On the fourteenth day of Adar the Jews of Susa got together again and killed three hundred more people in the city. But again, they did no looting. 
17Est 9:16 The Jews in the provinces also organized and defended themselves. They rid themselves of their enemies by killing seventy-five thousand people who hated them. But they did no looting. 
17Est 9:17 This was on the thirteenth day of Adar. On the next day, the fourteenth, there was no more killing, and they made it a joyful day of feasting. 
17Est 9:18 The Jews of Susa, however, made the fifteenth a holiday, since they had slaughtered their enemies on the thirteenth and fourteenth and then stopped on the fifteenth. 
17Est 9:19 This is why Jews who live in small towns observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a joyous holiday, a time for feasting and giving gifts of food to one another. 
17Est 9:20 Mordecai had these events written down and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, throughout the Persian Empire, 
17Est 9:21 telling them to observe the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar as holidays every year. 
17Est 9:22 These were the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies; this was a month that had been turned from a time of grief and despair into a time of joy and happiness. They were told to observe these days with feasts and parties, giving gifts of food to one another and to the poor. 
17Est 9:23 So the Jews followed Mordecai's instructions, and the celebration became an annual custom. 
17Est 9:24 Haman son of Hammedatha - the descendant of Agag and the enemy of the Jewish people - had cast lots ("purim," they were called) to determine the day for destroying the Jews; he had planned to wipe them out. 
17Est 9:25 But Esther went to the king, and the king issued written orders with the result that Haman suffered the fate he had planned for the Jews - he and his sons were hanged from the gallows. 
17Est 9:26 That is why the holidays are called Purim. Because of Mordecai's letter and because of all that had happened to them, 
17Est 9:27 the Jews made it a rule for themselves, their descendants, and anyone who might become a Jew, that at the proper time each year these two days would be regularly observed according to Mordecai's instructions. 
17Est 9:28 It was resolved that every Jewish family of every future generation in every province and every city should remember and observe the days of Purim for all time to come. 
17Est 9:29 Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai, also wrote a letter, putting her full authority behind the letter about Purim, which Mordecai had written earlier. 
17Est 9:30 The letter was addressed to all the Jews, and copies were sent to all the 127 provinces of the Persian Empire. It wished the Jews peace and security 
17Est 9:31 and directed them and their descendants to observe the days of Purim at the proper time, just as they had adopted rules for the observance of fasts and times of mourning. This was commanded by both Mordecai and Queen Esther. 
17Est 9:32 Esther's command, confirming the rules for Purim, was written down on a scroll. 
17Est 10:1 King Xerxes imposed forced labor on the people of the coastal regions of his empire as well as on those of the interior. 
17Est 10:2 All the great and wonderful things he did, as well as the whole story of how he promoted Mordecai to high office, are recorded in the official records of the kings of Persia and Media. 
17Est 10:3 Mordecai the Jew was second in rank only to King Xerxes himself. He was honored and well-liked by his fellow Jews. He worked for the good of his people and for the security of all their descendants.
